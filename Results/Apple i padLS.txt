Not a specific composer or work but something I didn’t really grasp until recently.
And I also want apple to make their iPhones be a little bit thicker don’t ever make them thinner bigger battery life, fully metal on the back only glass on the part where there’s wireless charging and take the top part of the phone and make the bezel a little bit bigger and take all the sensors that are for the Face ID and cameras and speakers and put them in that bezel area so you don’t have any cut out on the screen ever and then put a heat sink sink in the inside of the iPhone so the iPhone doesn’t overheat
Can the Apple Watch please not be thinner bigger, battery, life and flat displays on all the models and I want the Apple Watch to have the ability to be able to get set up without ever having to be hooked up to an iPhone and to be able to update software update with no phone I would like the Apple Watch to be able to be used with people that have android phones
Can we get new designs for iPads please the iPad pros the iPad Air the iPad mini the regular iPad I want all the iPads to have the camera on the top of the iPad like the regular cheaper iPad and I also want the regular cheaper iPad to be able to support the pencil to be able to charge and magnet to the iPad and they can do it if they really wanted to do it if they wanted to because I saw another company do that in Apple is not doing it and can the iPads please get bigger battery life and the ability to use the steam website to play steam games, I would love apple to get rid of the iPad Air for good
I just want one thing.
s9 ultra mı ipad 10.nesil mi alsam karar veremedim 🥺
abi yeni çıkan apple pencil usb yi de kıyaslar mısın bir de ipad 10. nesilim var yeni kalemimi almalıyım yoksa 1. nesili mi
İnsanın açtıkça açasım geliyor :d 😂
Samsung wacom'un teknolojisini kullanıyor,, bazi wacom kalemleri samsung cihazlar ile uyumlu
apple ne yazıkki tablet konusunda samsungun gerisinde samsung bu işi biliyor her parçası ayrı pahalı olan kutuyada koymayan paran yoksa küçük ekran kullanmak zorundasın kardeşim diyen apple almak pek mantıklı gelmedi üstelik bir çok uygulamada ücretli bizim gibi fakir ülkerlerde artık apple lükstür NOKta
Cuma günü ipad 10.nesil almayı düşünüyorum pdf ve sunum ve not almayı düşünüyorum sizce alınabilir mi
S8 ultra tft mi s8ultra mı s9+ mı daha iyi
Cırt ayşe teyze, selamlar 🫡
S9fe + sitelerde bazen çift kamera bazen tek kamera görünüyor arkasında seri olarak farklı modeller mi var yoksa siteler 6gb ve tek kamera modeli mi gondermeye çalışıyor
Bilinen 8gb ram +çift kamera
Hocam ipad pro ile s9 ultrayıdı kouaslasan bir ilk olir TR de seviliyorsun
Fe plus normal tablet boyutundan çok büyük keşke 8gb ram ve bataryası 10bin mah olan fe olsaydı
Ağzınıza sağlık abi , gerçek çok iyi is çıkarmışsınız harikasınız🎉
S9 ultra aldim seni izleyerek abi cihaz fena ❤ umarim daha cok video cekersin bu arada
S9 fe plus kullaniyom aklinda soru olan varsa soyleyin
Yahu şu S9 FE'lerdeki HDMI ile görüntü aktaramama ne kadar saçma iştir arkadaş.

I feel bad for sarah's .WALLET!
I can understand at work though because the building I’m in blocks a lot of the signals but I was wondering what this SOS thing means
15.7.1 is the best update in history if you agree then like ❤
if Apple can break your battery and you have to buy a new one from them lots more money for them 😅
i hope they add in ios 18 that when ure watching netflix or something while facetime audio or video u can seperatly change volume for media and calls, not to be in call volume media aswell, sometimes i want to have movie louder than call volume but yeah its bad, and other thing when ur in call with someone media sounds sound so bad like its not hq sound, media sounds like someone is playin audio trough call or something its so bad, and one more thing when ur facetiming someone on audio call its says facetime audio, u switch it to facetime video and when u switch it u cant go back to facetime audio you can turn off camera but u will still be in facetime video and even when u both disabled cameras the camera thing on screen is still there and its such a distraction to me.
Hi,,, good choice mate,,,,I did the same but back in 2021,,,my first mac was the M1pro 16ram 1tb SSD, was & still is a brilliant machine but I made a mistake not bumping up the ram to 32gb,,,I'm working in Photoshop and illustrator 10h a day, pretty big files with tons of layers, so need more ram,,, actually what I did, sold my m1pro and bought a M1max with 64gb ram and 4tb ssd for £2400 brand new,,,,a lot of people would say that it was a bad move and I should upgrade to the new M3 family but to be honest, M1pro\max is plenty for what I need it for, just need more ram,,,,and of course the price,,the new one is £3600 in the UK (,,,I have sold my M1pro for 1700,,added another 700 to it and now I have 2x the gpu, 4x the ram 4x the SSD,,,,M1max still a rocket,,,,And I was \still is a window guy for 20years, have a wear os watch, Android phone, but if it comes to laptops, I prefer macbooks
RIP there goes another windows user take care buddy this is where we depart......
For a first laptop I'm getting a binned m3 max tomorrow.

Hey sarah i really hope i get to win the iphone because i badly need a new phone for school since my phone isnt really working well, and unfortunately my parents cant afford to buy me a new one, its really hard using an onld phone since its really buggy and it lags so much so im having a hard time at school works when we have an activity and it needs to be digital im not able to pass it on time since my phone is so laggy and it crashes most of the apps and also sometimes when we have an activity where we shoot films in a certain subject i dont usually get my hopes high because my camera is really busted and also my screen so yeah, i really hope i get to win an iphone, and also i want to win an iphone to watch more of your vlogs.
Alright, so the advantage of the Pros over the air are:

Pro-motion 120hz display

Better GPU (8 vs 4)

Face ID

Extra cameras and sensor

Thinner bezel

128GB storage starting price (vs 64 for air)

Apple education bundle with free airpods (The new air won't have this, since promotion ends this month)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With all these, I'd say Pro is still worth the money


Huh Touch ID in the power button maybe that’s their solution for the FaceID Problem on iPhones


* New colors: green, pink and blue (silver and space gray remains)

* Touch ID integrated in power button

* A14 SoC (16 cores)

* 10.9" Liquid Retina Display (2360x1640)

* True Tone, P3 Wide

* USB C

* Front 7mp HD FaceTime Camera; 12mp camera (same as iPad Pro)

* Starts at $599, Available next month


What the fuck the prices and options compared to the Pro 11"

It's beautiful, but... like 64Gb, for $599, then you jump to $749 for 256Gb... then why not just look at the Pro 11"!!!
My friends all getting their contacts wiped…ios 17 🤬👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I had the Apple Watch since it came out and the app all go I have no app from third party apps apart from “tiny game of pong”  that’s awesome but twitter and there was a good TV guide app that shutdown because they can make money and when the watch came out there was apps for everything and the slowly disappeared and it’s still the same you get a notification on your watch and that’s it can’t tap and get taken to the app it’s still disappointing for a ten year old device and they still are changing the buttons function Apple don’t know how to use the watch still it’s sad for the newer $1000 plus ultra watch ⌚️
19:38 voiceover doesn’t work on the action button no menu no voiceover program is just another switch for mute
Since iOS 17 iPhone 14 plus, I seem to be having issues sending texts to android users, where my phone shows I sent it but the person on the other end never receives it.
Amen 🙏❤️
I really need a Apple Watch and can’t afford it so Sarah, if you have an extra one, I would really like it
Can I win and iphone plz I have a crappy android it's so slow thx

💚🇵🇸💚



I Bought the MOST RARE Apple Products


Only real Sarah fans can like this
😂 Omg it takes me back  we had one of those iMacs in my elementary school just sitting there for a whole decade (I’m not old, 20 years old) but it was so funny to me because how ancient it was and it was broken but they still kept it all that time in a room😂
Wow so real that I thought that it was real
I think Apple should try again with the camera considering the camera quality on the newer iphones
#BRINGBACKTHEEMATE
Lol
Pls may I have the iPhone 😢
Apple wasnt a computer brand before then they starting to make the closthe and apple will never make their phone slim because is 2012 iphone goal to be the slimmest now the goal is businesses
I'm a big fan, even in your Instagram and Facebook page
but i love your videos
why is her videos all apple im going to call you you  apple girl or the iPhone girl
precious Sarah.

Only true subsciber can like and comment this video🎉❤
Hi Sarah ❤️❤️
Can you sAY the difference between iPhone and ipod
4:20 looks like waffle maker but slimmer 🤣🤣🤣
i like those iphones
2:55 i've never use Floppy disk too.
😂
Hey amazing content i just got a  question since u r an editor...i ordered the same one u got since i edit alot on premiere pro...i have all my footage or an external harddisk...my footage is usually around 400-700GB and mostly 4k...i used to proxy my footage to be able to work smoother...u recommend me to do so on this one since so many people say i need 32RAM for 4k...or is 18 enough for me to work without proxies
Edit:and does it handle multi camera nests well since my last windows made it hell for me to edit on like 5 camera multicam window
Get the Max Version you love it,  you can put in low power mode if you want more battery life and its still faster then m2 max on high power
The first AAA game comes out on December 20th, leaked performance numbers show the Macbook Pro Max is the same as an Alienware M18 64G (i9 13900HX RTX 4080).
These sessions were culled, edited and delivered^ using my iPad:

*^ Some may have been put back through Lightroom for cataloguing and then exported, but the editing was done on the iPad.
* Phone = <8"
* Tablet = 8" - 11/12"
* Laptop = 12"/13 upwards

Phone primary form factor = light to hold in single hand and put in pocket

Laptop primary form factor = large enough screen to be productive, long battery and keyboard-touchpad mechanical UI and desktop-OS features

Tablet that is 11":

* half the weight of a laptop
* notebook size screen so good for notes with pen or touch use
* screen is usable for books or art or productivity though is small screen for such use
* battery is small for laptop use but becoming better each generation
* optional bluetooth keyboard/mouse for laptop use in addition to tablet use

My opinion is the tablet form factor mainly weight and screen size makes for excellent portable device for tablet use and productivity laptop use but is set back by the iOS/iPadOS for the latter.
Super annoying
My BMW wireless charger hasn’t worked since the day I bought it anyways
In IOS 17.1.1 on my Iphone 15 pro, i used to charge daily before this update, by evening it would be at 20%, but now after update i charge 80% before goint to bed and the following day in the eveing berore going to bed the same time am at 50%, Just using the phone full time but not a heavy user, like gaming,  but just calling, whatsapp, music, audio books full time
i’m sure I’m gonna get a bunch of judgmental or rude comments here cause that’s just what the Internet is like now but it’s kind of funny for anybody who’s been paying attention the iPhone 15 is the first model in a long time to have the amount of issues that it has the issues I am talking about are all the overheating problems btw
0:26 what watch face is that??
The console and peripherals have similar aesthetics too


Oh yeah they have only done the Dual Analog sticks, Bluray, pushing VR, pushed 3D gaming the hardest and set the standard, CD-Rom, Dualshock which set the standard for vibration in game controllers till this day and now the Daulsense will do it again with amazing haptic feedback and active triggers, force sensitive buttons, Touch pad, motion sense, gyro, universal media disk, PS+ which brought about games with gold, Shareplay and remote play, eyetoy which was a likely inspiration for the Kinect, PlayTV, folding@home, OLED screens with Vita and VR, Backwards compatability, USB ports, making gaming more casual outside of just gamers by doing games such as Singstar and eyetoy, I think PS2 was also the first console you could install a HDD.

i am just in shock at the fact that the second gen (and significantly better) apple pencil doesn’t work on the new ipad but they changed the port to usb-c so you literally just can’t even charge the fucking stylus on the ipad

Needless to say, it's shite, especially the 10.

In no particular order:

Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz, particularly movements IV and V

A Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky

The Planets by Gustav Holst, particularly Jupiter

Im wunderschonen monat mai by Robert Schumann for something “smaller” and vocal but indescribably beautiful

New World Symphony by Dvorak

Elsa’s Procession to the Cathedral by Wagner but specifically the arrangement played by the US Marine Band, the build to the end is the most powerful emotion music has ever made me feel and the most air I’ve ever had to push through my instrument when performing

Edit: I find romantic era music to be the most accessible on an emotional level, plus I think it can sound more familiar to our ears thanks to modern film scores.

Apple can do upgrades easily to their devices without raising prices because they have ridiculous profit margins but they will choose to raise prices an further rip off customers instead, I like an use all Apple products but Apple has been giving us less ports chargers headphones and services while charging more every few years causing the Apple tax price to get out of hand, on iPad we need 9” ipad pro with thin bezels, 👍👍video
Apple deeply knows that alot of its focus is on apple iphones ,apple watches,and macbooks the rest have minimal hype that's why only a few of their products received decent upgrades
iPads are good looking already I really wish Apple  introduce Dynamic Island and landscape camera setup across its iPads line up..
I personally consume a lot, but I also manage my unRAID server via Termius (SSH) and Files (SMB), ZenDesk stuff through Safari, home wiki through Notion, tasks through ClickUp (web app as it's miles better than the regular app and works perfectly in Safari), notes through Craft, longer form writing through Ulysses (though I'm starting to use Craft more exclusively lately), research and general knowledge collection through DevonThink, work chat through Slack, finances through YNAB (again using the web app), emailing through Fastmail (and Spark but the FM app and web app are a lot more functional), remote desktop via Splash (for my VNCed containers) and Jump (for my Windows VM that pretty much exists just to run ComicRack), and more.
They could also put it in control center so when you click it it either opens a small window next to control center or it takes over Control Center until you're done with the calculation; Or they can make it a slide over application


All they need to do is to make the size of calculator bigger…

It’s a stupid reason that “we want to add additional stuff and not just give a resized version of iOS calculator”, just give the resized version while you work on your “majestic calculator”, you can always update the apps 💀

If they wanna really add additional features, I can think of so many off the top of my head, a graphing calculator like desmos, a polynomial equation calculator like mathway, a matrix/determinant calculator, etc.
Whats the app name?👀



APPLE ha RISOLTO un Enorme Problema.🍎😱


Meno male che hanno risolto non ci dormivo la notte
Se questo è  l’enorme problema boh, onestamente Apple se iniziasse a mettere le batterie intercambiabili come ogni prodotto  Apple 🗿 magari non spendiamo altri schei per comprarne di Nuove
Ma ha solo contro per solo 5€ in meno
Cazzo che affare 95 euro per una penna
Finalmente
😎
Ok ma il fatto è che quando è tutta la usbc su un iPad non ridisegnato da 0 quindi con un design da cavo Lightning
crearti un problema e venderti una soluzione
Creano i problemi e se li risolvono da soli lol, che sono intelligenti 💀☠️
Pure 95 € per una penna 😂 sono malati proprio questi

Ngl it looks like a fake screen.
Speaking of foldable screens - my prediction is that no matter what Samsung or anyone else does they won't see wide adoption until Apple "innovates" it


You could say the same for Google using a DOT sensor for face unlock after Apple introduced FaceID, or Android and Windows manufacturers using glass capacitive touchscreens instead of plastic resistive (LG technically did it a month earlier first, but the iPhone triggered the trend), fast pairing Bluetooth devices, gesture navigation on the iPhone X implemented in Android 9, notification badges in Android 8 (although manufacturers added it to their skins earlier), security granularity added in Android 10.

Question in 10:41.
I would like to:

-Do some Netflix/general browsing

-Have a device that can handle some light coding as a hobby for building apps/websites 

-Be able to use the device to write reports/novel ideas sketch out possible plans etc

-Do some very light gaming: specifically: MTG Arena (might be a while before the app is ready), Football Manager type stuff 

-Have a super portable device that can stream/read books etc when on holiday 

-Decent battery life 

-Be future proof for at least 5 years

-Sync up with my XR, my wife’s XR and Apple Watch to seamlessly switch to the device and pick up with whatever I was browsing on my phone or whatever.
A vendor can refuse accepting that as payment: https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52/page-1.html

Limitation

(2) A tender of payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;

(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;

(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;

(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and

(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.
You want a calculator you have at least 7 choices:
- buy a calculator (10 cents at my local thrift store)
- get a free calculator app for your iPad
- buy a calculator app for your iPad (I use MaxiCalc Pro - $1.99 (for which I get to use it on three iPads, plus family sharing), but they also have a free version)
- buy an Apple Watch and use the included calculator app
- buy an iPhone and use the included calculator app
- use the calculator you already have on your PC
- use pencil/pen & paper

I too hate that Apple is too stingy to include a calculator app on the iPad (regardless of the history, that is the only valid reason now).
for sure a giant leap forwards for the iPad pro, but i hope the move to include an M1 chip signals something big coming with iPadOS 15 or apple's gonna have a tough time justifying why someone should drop the same amount of money on a 12.9" iPad over a macbook air with the same chip yet capable of running so many more of the apps which creatives rely on every day to get work done, until then this thing – amazing as the iPad Pros are as someone with the 2018 12.9 which still holds up as an absolutely superb tablet –  is just an expensive overpowered toy which can't really be depended on in any real capacity as a creation device.
You can still take great notes on it, but actually have a full fledged OS on it with a fledged file manager (iPad doesn't), better specs for all types of projects available, better keyboard which you will need to write papers and projects, ability to run windows (which is extremely important in school often since somethings require or is a fuck ton easier on an actual laptop/windows), is already extremely light to the point that it is practically nothing in the bag with an M1 air only literally a couple of pounds, takes up very little space, and will be more capable period across way more types of assignments and use cases.
apple's old designation for their taditional professional / semi-professional users, who cared about things like hotkeys, automator / apple script, scriptable file operations, And all the other stuff that's builtin to macos and that the ipad doesn't have – or is re-implementing, *poorly,* like keyboard support + standardized application hotkeys)

It's not completely unsuited for professional-ish work if you can find the right app for something, sure, but it's not a computer in the same sense that a mac, or any other PC is in the lineage of the OG Xerox machines, or personal computer building kits / projects / etc., is.
It’s Apple trying to be competitive in the tablet market at every price point


seriously - this is exactly what he walked into at Apple in 1997 but with the countess Macintosh models that their own product managers couldn't tell him what differentiated them and why they existed, so he scrapped them all

good article on the current problem too I found when searching for the above image: https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2022/03/apple-computer-history-diagram/


Not with how many skus of iPad he was selling


For 64GB.
Try the 16 go I got on my original iPad Air


Honestly the iPad Air 64GB is horrible and I only use to watch movies to go some apps like starz and showtime uses almost 10-15 GB for a season to go also the more you use it for music listening lately IOS 15 will say you have 8 GB of storage uses but no downloads have to constantly reset mine to factory for storage issues idk if it’s a bug in the IOS system but I know why they do it for the upsell but even the iPad mini and iPhone SE starts at 64GB now days apps are memory hungry all devices should start at 128 GB and the Pros at 256GB

>Long press on the tab view button (bottom right icon) to bring up a menu - I find creating a private tab easier from here than the ‘default’ way

>if you enter the private tab group and just hit ‘done’ (might be different in English) in the bottom right, a new tab is created automatically

>you can also close tabs from the menu hidden in the tab view button which is still inconvenient but slightly better than the ordinary way

Edit: bonus tip: if you have a XS or iPhone with 3d touch, you can hard press the tab view button to bring up the hidden menu instantly


Anyone experience airdrop issues?
