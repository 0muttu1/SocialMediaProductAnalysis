1. I don't know for sure, but I'd doubt it. I've read it starts you midgame so you can get a feel for it, so wouldn't make sense to carry over  from a midgame point.

2. I think it's just part of the game so will be there no matter what, though I thought you had to beat the game to unlock it.


I was told that the gameplay in Infinite Wealth won't be in the main game. I am not sure how true that is but that's what I heard so no transfer of data and I doubt it'll start at the very beginning of the game. Most likely it'll start us off in some other area. The trial won't be unlocked until Gaiden is finished because Infinite Wealth spoils the ending for Gaiden.


You have to beat Gaiden before it lets you launch the demo for IW. And for people who’ve played the demo and didn’t notice >!the bartender at the bar Kiryu takes Kasuga to is the CIA agent from Yakuza 3!<


there is no confirmation of data transfer, i don't think there will be any. 

no time limited as been stated either, it is included with gaiden and is playable upon beating gaiden's story


1. I really doubt it. 
2. You don't have a choice in this anyway. You have to beat Gaiden first


1. unlikely, >!given it starts in chapter 2 of the "final" game!<
2. probably forever, it's bundled in with gaiden. it requires a completed gaiden save and/or final chapter achievement though


So i just beat Gaiden and got access to the demo i'm assuming i can play as much as i want to? I really don't know to be honest can someone let me know?


I really wanna play the demo but I don't wanna spoil any surprises


1) probably not, since the gameplay section is apparently from chapter 5 

2) the demo doesn't even unlock until you finish Gaiden, so I imagine it's here to stay


1. No  
2. Even my old (Japanese) trial versions are still available so I assume it is here to stay.


1. Ahh I see, if that's true, yeah you're right about it making no sense.

2. Okay that makes sense too!

Thanks!


the exclusive content refers to cutscenes specific to the ending of gaiden that won't be present in the final release of 8

the gameplay is otherwise the same as the tgs demo


I feel ya!


From looking at a video it's just 3 substories and some of minigames


After some story


Infinite wealth demo gameplay is from the chapter 5 of game if I remember correctly.


apparently there's 2 parts, an adventure demo where you explore hawaii, and another part that's the first 45mins of the story


Lmao I was wondering the same things until I saw this thread... tried out the English dub first when I started the demo. After about 5 minutes I manually closed the game and reloaded with Japanese. Worst English VA for Kiryu they could've ever chosen. I liked Ichiban's from Like a Dragon, but I just can't picture listening to Kiryu like that ever again in life.


well now I'm even more confused.
Because you said it's start.
and another poster just said its from chapter 5 of game


[deleted]


that would be the adventure part in hawaii, as the game starts in yokohama

No boss fight, but Roman calls Ichi regularly to go bowling


Furina bullies Crabaletta in rock paper scissors confirmed.


Of course Furina would beat up a seal and a crab to demonstrate her fighting skills 💀

English Translation:

The world is but a stage.  
Why cry, when you can laugh instead?  
For laughter is humanity's preserve.  
Laugh it all off, fret not,  
Let's just enjoy the moment.


Something about Wriothesley just decking a civilian made me spit out my drink


MADEMOISELLE CRABALETTA 🦀🦀🦀🦀


This is perhaps the funniest character demo so far. I laughed a lot when all of the Fontaine casts fought each other in chaos and then posed at the end.

Furina is truly the Archon of performances.


She had the Chief Justice himself get arrested in her play. Funniest shit i have ever seen


WAS SHE POSING AS THE OTHER ARCHONS IN 1:40?? LMAOO


Childe being chased by those Melusines is hilarious


Oh my god, the scenes at the very end with Furina running up to the fountain are HILARIOUS!

Lyney and Lynette just wailing on some poor dude while he huddles in fear.

Childe getting ready to jump forward and stab a beotch.

Neuvillette kneeing some poor bloke. How's that for JUSTICE?!


HOYO PLEASE MAKE AND RELEASE SURINTENDANTE CHEVALMARIN AS A PLUSHIE!!


Childe getting chased by Melusines kinda reminds me of Katheryne/Nahida before she got stabbed, and Melus and Silver restraining Neuvillette reminds me of Fatui Pyro Agents restraining the Traveler during Signora's confrontation with Venti. 

The magician twins swapping roles, everyone beating each other up, the poses at the end (especially Wriothesley's) are also pretty hillarious. Vocals are also a blessing.

Thank you very much Furina for messing with your fellow Fontainians (and that one Snezhnayan dude); you've made this demo comedy gold.


I love how Hoyo has began experimenting with more vocals + different styles of music in their trailers now!


She poses as the other archons at 1:40! In order of Nahida - Venti - Ei - Zhongli.

> Nahida's reference is the way she swings, similar to the start of Nahida's own demo

> She holds a lyre for the Venti reference

> She acts downcast and gloomy for Ei 

> She throws Mora because.. Morax.

I love her so much please come home tomorrow I cant wait for this goofy archon AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


Bro what did poor Neuvi do?


She beats up a seal, on land! lmao, what a little shit.


Little details in the giant brawl at the end

Lyney and Lynette kicking some dude on the ground 

Neuvillette, lord Chief Justice, kneeing some poor guy in the stomach

Wriothesley uppercutting someone

Navia and Clorinde arriving late, and then arguing amid the fight

Childe using his sticking his marks on someone, dropping kicking another person, and straight up pouncing to jump punch another guy

Two gardemeks fighting… each other…

One random guy is just playing dead, lying on the floor with no one around him

Also you can see Furina mimicking the other four archons we’ve met during the swing scene. She copies Nahida’s pose, Venti’s lyre, Ei’s meditation stance, and throws Mora, which isn’t really accurate considering Zhongli’s lack of income


The fear in Childe’s eyes as he runs from those Melusines


She's an icon. She's a legend. She IS the moment.


This was such a silly demo but it's what makes it so perfect. I loved everything about this. 😭

Idk what's my favorite part: Childe running from the Melusines or Neuvillette getting "taken/arrested" or everyone fighting each other in the end 😂


THE SINGING IS GLORIOUS


Childe running from Melusines is hilarious


“Nah I’d win” proceeds to bully up a seal and a crab with her three helpers


That was an amazing demo! Perfect for Furina. The ending with all the characters is just perfection.


\---- Cast ----

Starring: Furina  
Writer: Furina  
Lights: Furina  
Music: Furina  
Producer: Furina  
Director: Furina


This demo is absolutely hilarious.

Seeing them fight around the fountain before posing.

This actually might be a personal contender for #1 demo.


BEST DEMO LITERALLY EVER SHE CLEARS EVERYONE


Clorinde watching Furina beat the shit out of sea lions 👁️👄👁️


Someone in this subreddit once called Focalors "A theater kid who accidentally gained divine power".  I did not expect that to be accurate on the point of prescience.


The fact that she even has Childe there is impressive in its own right. Also, what kind of crime do you think Childe committed for him to be chased by three Melusines?


Mihoyo, I kneel.


MHY, I always thought you were trying to avoid powercreep, and then you release a demo like this.

What the hell?


Perfect trailer. Best one yet, tears in my eye, beautiful.


Furina getting her gang to beat on some helpless civilians while she sits and eats cake is some peak energy. 

I don't know what kind of energy, but it's definitely peak.


She plays rock paper and scissors with a fucking crab, and wins.


They really doubled down on the performer/artist aspect of her. Truly the Archon of Drama and Theatre
Also, Furina de Fontaine is her full name


The demo is so unique and full of character, I can't wait! only 24h left!  
Girlboss ftw


Say these holy words with me:🗣️💯🔥

If Furina has a million fans, I'm one of them.

If Furina has five fans, I'm one of them.

If Furina has one fan, that one is me.

If Furina has no fans, I'm no longer on earth.

If the world is against Furina, then I'm against the world.


Childe getting chased by melusines had me cackling. This trailer is so unserious and I love it.


[JP version with Minase Inori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5VJ2RMwRAY)


I'm just happy to see her thriving.

Also that demo was the best yet.


I can't get the picture of Neuvillette getting arrested out of my mind, help


Definitely the most chaotic demo ever


When a video makes you feel emotion, you know it’s a good video.  I had a dumb smile when watching this, as expected of Furina!


For an Archon with a depressing story line this is a very unserious character demo lol


Nah she did Mademoiselle Craballeta wrong with that rocket paper scissors game LMFAO Craballeta can only do scissors and she did rock LOL


Neuvillette getting arrested by Navia

Childe getting chased down by melusines

Clorinde and Wriothesley dueling

Lyney being inside the water tank instead of Lynette

Everybody doing a hooray pose in the end

I love how everything is so out-of-character


The fuck this archon demo? it look like some movie trailer so fancy and different


Also poor Neuvillete lol


Now I really, REALLY wish that [French dubbing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYuCKN9O0I0) took off and Hoyo decided to officially implement the language into the game.


I love everything about this character demo. Furina is too cute.


LOL NOT THE SECRET SERVICE MELUSINES 😭😭 furina basically making fanfiction on the fontaine cast is so peak hoyo cooked here


The he world is her stage, and we the audience ARE WATCHING !


This was amazing, this and the teaser have blown all my expectations out of the water.  
Demo's like these are why I say that people who haven't watched these, are missing out on a core aspect of the game.


As if everything leading up to Furina's release wasn't enough to sell us on her, this comes out and makes it basically impossible to not love her. Seriously, I wish you guys the best of luck to get her, because she's just basically amazing in every aspect possible!


THE FRENCH MUSIC W LYRICS ATEEEEEE


Barbara: let the show begin

Furina: LET THE SHOW BEGIN!

*Proceeds to declare war on the cute creatures*


She did that classic stick twirl. She is complete now.


"My dear vassal! This is not a foe you can lightly handle."

The foe in question : baby seal, the most harmless creature in Fontaine


She's such a brat and I love it.


This felt like a musical and I love it. Especially with the lyrics at the end. Turn that into a full musical song!


That was a fun demo 😍


The second act where furina went director mode everything was reversed:  
\- Childe running away from a fight against weak opponents   
\- Neuvillette being the one arrested, lyney instead of lynette in the tank    
\- Freminet almost suffocating on land then clorinde dueling in pankration in Meropide.   
\- Mirrored like what you see when looking at the surface of the water.


good god... I might change my flair because Furina is literally the cutest character in the game... like how can you even make her cry


Best demo they've made imo, surpassing the previous best which was nahida's.


Her pose at 1:53 reminded me of Michael Jackson lmao. It even makes sense with the outfit stance switch 

So much random references to musicals, silent film, Singing in the Rain, Shakespeare, and of course French influence. I love it


Hoyoverse, I implore you. Please, PLEASE give us an extended version of the french song!


oh my god when it breaks into song. goddamn top tier demo


All of it was so fun to watch: the silent film part, her dancing with the pets, all the fontaine characters (+ childe) acting alongside her.

Also, I am a simple person. I hear jazz in a demo, it goes to the top of the list for me.


Neuv literally knee-ing someone in the stomach at the end lmao


Sasuga Furina-sama


I love Clorinde and Navia arguing at the end instead of actually joining in the fighting.


BEHOLD THE MULTI TALENTED DIRECTOR, ACTRESS, SINGER, PHOTOGRAPHER, SCREENPLAY WRITER


FURINA DE FONTAINE!!!!!


edit: my kpop side wrote this...


made a mistake making the demo go this hard,cause they can never top this again


The Knave: Then I ask you, Miss Furina, just what have you been working on? Where can we see it, and what is it doing to help?

Furina: *shows Demo*

The Knave: Well played Focalor, well played.


**She imitates other archons when she swings back and forth! The color of the background changes accordingly to match the element of the archons she imitates!**

##SHE CANNOT COME SOON ENOUGH


Fuck hydro, homegirl is the Hype Archon


lmao the old man finally putting justice into his own ~~*knees*~~ hands


What’s going on here? The battle-hungry Childe fleeing from the gentle Melusines, the judge Neuvillete being arrested, Lynette the magician’s assistant making the great magician Lyney disappear into water instead of fire, and so on, and so on, ending with a performance by the Hydro Archon herself being met with silence. 

The answer is simple: these are delusions driven by madness. Everyone has drowned within the waters. Furina is alone, and this is what she sees.


Best character trailer hands down. Wow.


Childe: "I fear no man. But that thing..."

**being chased by those Melusines**

Childe: "...it scares me."


Regular day in France


The theme of Fontaine is the French Existentialism vs Essentialism debate, basically free will vs destiny.

Melusine are born from their token, born from ship debris, love ships, born from musical instrument love music, this is Essentialism, our nature determines our lives and destiny.

Oceanids are born formless and can take any form, they are scattered all over Teyvat after the death of the previous Archon, they are free to live their lives, this is Existentialism.

>!From the 2 Furina trailers, what she is saying is that the prophecy is real, it is Fontaine's destiny to be flooded. For the past 500 years she has set up an elaborate play, to trick destiny itself into fulfilling the prophecy within the play itself.She has turned Fontaine itself into a fake spectacle, with everyone unknowingly taking part in her play, what this means is that instead of everyone living their lives based on their Essence, she has instead gave them a fake Existence, she forced her people to live a life of "free will" within the play she has written.!<

>!Everyone lived their lives not knowing what they truly are, there's actually a world quest that revealed that Fontainians are actually Oceanids, which is why they dissolve into water in contact with Primordial Sea. How will this play out to trick destiny, who's actually guilty; I think that Focalors did all this so that she becomes the sinner instead of her people as she is the one sentenced to death. With all the bible references in Fontaine, she is literally going to be Jesus and die for her people's sins!<


Such an upbeat demo! So glad this confirms nothing sad at all will happen to her.


The vocals are so good!!! i love her!!!!


It was upbeat?! I was sure this was gonna be a downer. Absolute GOAT demo though. 11/10.


Neuvillette kneeing some random dude in the end is SENDING me💀


This trailer is PACKED. The music, the editing, the Fontainian characters, the funny skits, the French singing, EVERYTHING.

Furina can't come soon enough!


The best demo in genshin history hands down


Hands down best demo yet, everything is just superb.


Somebody stop her! She's running off with all my primos!!


Childe is really Mr.Worldwide he’s the ONLY non fontainian character in the demo. He’s out there chilling with the rest of the cast like he has an honorary Fontaine citizenship 🤣


That poor crab getting bullied 😢


Poor Mademoiselle Crabaletta losing in rock paper scissors just like that.  1:35 time stamp.


This actually made me sad. Because I'm unemployed, and this is the kind of thing that really makes me want them to take my money. Well done,  masterfully done.


Thank heavens the hydro archon was around, god knows what could've happened to Clorinde if she had fought against such a powerful foe on her own.

Furina's a blast, omg.


In twitter jp Neuvillette knee kick became a trend lol


seeing childe chased by melusines is extremely funny to me specifically because mid archon quest i thought the sea bunnies kidnapped him from how odd sigewinne was acting LMFAO


I could fit this into Team Fortress 2's Meet the pyro "what goes on in that head off hers?" then cut to this trailer.


Woahh was not expecting the french at the end! Aha so cool to see all the Fontaine characters so far present in the demo and posing like it’s a tv show opening. Fave demo yet!


I love how Furina also portrait the other archons. Nahida on the swing, Venti with a harp, Ei on her meditation pose, and Zhongli throwing out mora


First demo with lyrics, she deserves it!


i never expected them to include french verses , for all her trailers no matter the region . this is just perfect .


All this laughter and smile scares me for what is waiting in backdrop. Something bad is about to happen


Childe really is Mr Worldwide…


I love musicals so this trailer having musical themes in it makes it my favorite character demo so far. It's very fun and it gives us so many funny shit in the background (Neuvillette kneeing some civilian is something I never thought I needed to see)


Man.. out of all the Archon trailers this is yet the most bombastic one. 🔥🔥


God I love this character so much. She's just creates nonsense everywhere she goes.


So this is the world through Furina's eyes, how fun and colorful! 😄

This IS THE CRAZIEST DEMO I HAVE EVER SEEN LMFAO.... WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS!!


Tortilla out here like "bro i don't even work here I just heard there was a fight"


I’ve only had Mademoiselle Crabaletta for a few minutes, but if anything happens to her I will kill everyone in this room and then myself


Man this is great. She's everything I've wanted and more.


Ou drama queen really did that lol I love how chaotic her demo is!


When Furina first appeared I didn’t like her that much. However, as we’ve had a chance to see her depth she’s been growing on me more and more. With this demo she’s shot up to one of my favorite characters! I love the light and fun contrast to her serious character teaser. It perfectly portrays the many facets of her as a character.

As far as the demo itself is concerned, it was fantastic! Easily one of my favorites, which is saying a lot. I loved all of the nods to the different performing arts from movies to plays to Broadway and even burlesque to name a few! I also loved that the whole Fontaine cast hard a part to play and all the little Easter eggs that were peppered throughout. And of course I would be remiss if I did not mention the grand finale, where the song has the vocals in french and the whole cast comes out to play. Definitely a showstopper!

I’m honestly so impressed that their demos are just getting better and better as time goes on. They are really nailing making the characters feel so different and unique with the Fontaine demos. In each and every one the character’s personalities really shine through.


I didn’t think it was possible to be both a girl boss and girl failure in three minutes


She is so damn French it hurts


Huh, so she get the death sentence for snuff film of babies seals?


Freminet's Head is missing
 No head :(


She's so smug and all flair. I love her


I can’t believe Childe was about to get jumped by a bunch of Melusines.


Childe dropkicking a guy in the brawl near the end sent me


They nailed the La la land vibes!


Timeless Furina de Fontaine


This is a tribute to the history of film-making from the time of Louis Le Prince!!!
Bravo!


I loved where all the characters would pose at the end! It made me smile and this trailer is amazing!!


Her personality is adorable!


She is perfection itself.


This is so chaotic. Lmao.


OMG THE SOUNDTRACK I LOVE HER

Im such a huge fan of steampunk stuff, water stuff, and all this fancy glorious theatre stuff im actually so happy fontaine exists its right up my alley


THIS IS TOO PERFECT. SHE'S TOO PERFECT. I AM DREADING THE ARCHON QUEST BUT I CANNOT WAIT TO PULL.


This character demo is so much fun!


Never thought Furina would have my favorite archon trailer


Bruh everything's so funny and unserious I love it 😭


i love her


Furina absolutely cook


Finally, an Archon trailer video that isn't actually depressing.


tartaglia running away from melusines  
holy shit my sides, he is the vegeta-tier jobber of genshin impact LMAO


One of the best demos alongside raiden and zhongli


she is so fucking extra lmfao hahahahah this is fun


Idk what that song was but I'ma need it


She changed clothes?


I actually burst out laughing at the chaotic brawl at the end.


Lynette and Lyney going full JoJo meme in that battle royale


I just realised the Mekas are doing the pose at the end too! This demo is the best 😭❤️


Ya trailer just summarised why I like this game so much. I haven't been playing a lot but if its an archon, the Mihoyo surely brings out the best of every aspect the game. Everything.


This has become my favorite demo.


2:22 she swats Neuv's hair lol


The last 10 seconds was my whole vibe.


The french dialogue caught me off guard, but it's so good


My menhera gremlin can't be this cute


Absolutely in-character


Arlecchino not in her demo or trailer. W mihoyo


Furina is going to be the toughest skip I've ever endured.


That was amazing! Bravo!


This was great! The music gave me Caravan Palace vibes. Definitely one of my favorite demos.


I laughed and cried at the same time help 😭


What an absolute banger of a trailer. I want the music as a full blown album with this genre.


There is no doubt about it, Furina **IS** a Goddess! Also her voice actor is absolutely killing the vocal performance haha


Hands down the best demo they've put out.


I love how she's like :

*"No Clorinde, this guy is too dangerous ; let me handle this"*... and then proceeds to beat up a poor seal.


Dude this has to be the greatest Demo Ever the fact she commanded the stage got her own song and featured every 4.0 character is CRAZY this is easily 2nd place after Raidens demo


This trailer has so many great details. Makes me wonder with her short hair version she seems more like an actor on the stage where her long hair outfit is more the director of the play I wonder if this means anything with the upcoming Archon quest. This trailer has so many details though that I probably didn't catch them all wonderful job on the trailer and I hope all Furina wanters will be havers!


Best demo they made by farrrr


No contest

As much as I love nahida and alhaitham and nuvelitte and Raiden and wanderer demos a lot imo this one is the best one by a long shot imo


Every damn frame on every single of her animations is just a fucking piece of art, top tier character design.


What a silly trailer...I love it, perfect for Furina


This was truly one of the trailers of all time. The shear goofiness of it all and the soundtrack managed to make me audibly laugh. Already one of my favourites.


this trailer is pure example of that: **They Had Us In the First Half** meme

first half (or more) was very mid (minus the scene where Furina was fighting seal and Clorinde was like "bruh, really"?), imho most boring Archon trailer **BUT** then at 1:52 it actually became very cool/funny as hell trailer. All the Fontaine cast+Childe in unique scenes, then literal musical moment, not to mention that this is our first ever trailer with lyrics. After all that masterpieces they created in HI3 and HSR I was surprised that all Genshin music had no lyrics at all beside Scrara boss theme and now Furina demo video. This makes me wish they released themed songs for each region cast/archon/story moment with lyrics


I'm quite surprised that there was no hidden thing at the end but I guess they didn't wanted to copy/repeat what they done with Nahida (the sudden black area moment and Nahida sitting alone there despite whole trailer being happy)


conclusion:

is this the epics/badass/cool trailer like Zhongli or Ei? hell no

is this the most funny character trailer they made? yes


This is hands down the best character demo and nothing even comes close. It feels like an introduction to an entire movie


Expected a little bit more from an archon trailer but a fine trailer nonetheless.


Not as hype as the other archon demos unfortunately but still very beautiful regardless.


Well her being the most human archon is right in line with this, her trailer(music) doesn't give that archon vibe at all


Its good but definitely the weakest archon demo until now  
  
Nahida / Raiden was just on another level


Nation of Justice? More like nation of circus

Because damn what the hell is this? The Goddess of the Clowns?


Maaan they do make it hard to skip her. Clorinde trumps everything though.


Good but doesn't hold the candle to other Archon ones (except Venti which basically aged badly).


People really be grabbing at one Mora when you need 240 Mora to buy a single apple.


Can someone convince me that Furina is not annoying and not incompetent? Or somehow redeemable anyway? I love her design and really wanted to pull for her, but all of her content in the archon quest has put me off.


I was a bit disappointment in the execution of this. All the elements were there, but it wasn't very cohesive. I think the marketing team that makes the demo trailers needs to research a bit more on what an opera (or Broadway musical) looks like


[deleted]


This is a justice god?


this demo is so fun


Such a fun trailer, really in contrast to the previous more serious teaser.


do we know the song that played at the end's name? it's sooo beautiful


She just exudes Hu tao energy and i love it.


How typical of Furina to beat up those too docile to fight back.


Even the character change sfx is included lmao


she’s a little silly


What a cute and funny Demo lol.


I find it interesting that her ousia splash art and in-game model have her with a vision but in the animation, she has a gem instead


Holy shit this is the most well produced demo yet!


beautiful


That's easily on top 3 Genshin demos!!!! loved it


Neuvilette's face at around 2:20 was priceless


It's missing a moonwalk


Omg this is fantastic!! This is kind of a trailer you wanna pause every second and look for details. Look at her meditating in Ei's pose on her swings lmao

Clorinde and Wrio about to fight are straight from that recent lightsaber duel shitpost.


"lady Furina, it is considered poor form to get in front of a black-and-white movie's dialogue"


Well, everything about this was downright delightful. :)


This is the best archon trailer after Zhongli. Visually, it might even be better.


Goddammit I need that weapon.

Edit: that was one of the best demos I've seen


OMG OMG SHES SO CUTE AND THE LIL SEAHORESS I LOVE HERRRR


I had a lot of fun watching this. Best part was the singing in the last few bits of the video.


This felt like a rawfler video haha. It was really good


This might be the best character trailer since Zhongli


I fucking love this, the brawl in the end was AMAZING LMAOOO

Childe jumping a random civilian, Lynette and Lyney ganging up on someone on the ground and of course Neuvillette just forgoing his water abilities entirely to knee some poor NPC lol


her standing triumphant over the seAL I CANT-


She really handled that blubberbeast


I’m a zhongli and raiden demo fan but this… probably can be even a commercial idm watching it anytime.


The curtains falls on the blue and white while the blue and black is nowhere to be seen 😭😭 I hope i wish I'm wrong with this theory


I do not know if it's unintentional, but angry crab 💢🦀emoji has a different meaning on Twitter


She knows Crabaletta cant do anything but scissors lmao


And is a certified Blubberbeast killer


Let's hope she doesn't beat up a local legend.


Reminds me of a meme from the Fate mobile game saying "Local chosen one found shadowboxing on the streets".


She attacked an innocent blubber beast. Of with her ~~head~~ hat.


I mean, IT IS probable that Corinde couldn't fight something that cute.


bro you cooked with this one hoyoverse, and its absolute fire


The unexpected singing just puts the icing on this cake of a character demo AAAHHHHH <3 <3 <3


That is an awesome song, like icing on a delicious cake. 

I can hardly wait for the patch to arrive!


Ladies and gentlemen, you’ve outdone yourselves with this one. Bravo!


| The world is but a stage. Why cry, when you can laugh instead?

Could not have summed up her any better. Bravo Hoyo


Cinematic masterpiece thats what this trailer is


Furina is so cute! xD


This might be one of the best character demos I've seen so far


Avenged sevenfold vibes.


Girl think she's Joy Boy.


And they say she's powerless. What other Archon can overpower the localization?


"Car le rire est le propre de l'homme."
OK. Elle est VRAIMENT française!


This is unbelievable amounts of peak! 11/10! 6 stars! The song is going to keep me coming back to this trailer


Need. Pronounciation. Now.


> The world is but a stage.

Let's see what the Fontaine immortal bard had to say about that trailer.

"Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” (Shakespeare).

Strangely accurate. Well done guys, really well done (and very gloomy).


You won't convince me the singer speaks french. It's barely understandable.


Lyney and Lynette literally kicking and punching a dude on the ground at the end was hilarious


It looks like Childe was going in for a power bomb on a randie too lmfao


And Neuvillette too kicking the guard at the back.

Edit: Old man still had it.


If you can see the last part before the pose he doesn't even seem to be hitting the civilian anymore LMFAO


Bro had enough and just decided to send him with a vicious uppercut then pose with him right after lol, cant totally see him doing that fr


Childe doing a drop kick is also there XD

So yeah that finale is quite chaotic which I love it


she really challenged a crab to rock paper scissors 😭😭


🦀💢


CRABULOUS


Doing rock paper scissors against a crab and picking rock every time is so rude lmao.


I would roll specifically for her if I wasn't saving for others


Neuvillette, The Hydro Sovereign, just punching and kicking a civilian like he's in a parking lot fight is the best thing I've seen today.


Reminds me a lot of the finale of Kingsman, where **everyone in the world** starts fighting each other, set to comically unfitting background music

It’s so ridiculous and fun


[the fontaine cast at the end of the archon quest be like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyFQVZ2h0V8)


Big Blazing Saddles finale energy in that ending scene.  Wonder if that was intentional.


I'm just at an utter loss for words. I will NEVER be this excited and ready for another character again. She's just perfect and this whole demo was ***chef's kiss***.

Furina De Fontaine just has that *je ne sais quoi*.


Not just that, but he was also kneestriking a random mofo near the end.


Most star studded trailer I’ve ever seen


Hoyoverse outdid themselves with this one, this is peak


yeah i lost it at that part lmaoo


Getting arrested and beating the shit outta someone Neuvillette has had enough lmao


I think it’s mimicking the scene where Signora (played by Navia) steals the gnosis from Venti (played by Neuvillette)


I feel that everyone's doing is just opposite to their actual identity in lore. 

Fantasy vs Real


She really can do whatever she wants and nobody stops her!


You can even see the civilians change to match the archon being copied

There’s even the “character switch” SFX between archons because she’s literally “switching characters” between the four (and guess how many playable characters you can have on one team)


SHE ALSO THROWS MORA AS ZHONGLI LMAO


OH MY GOD, I DIDN'T NOTICE HER POSES.

This Trailer has so many small, hilarious details.


Green light and Sumeru people, Turquoise light and Mondstadt people, Purple light and Inazuma people, Amber light and Liyue people and a Mora overflow.

That's a yes.


YES


Lmao, I just realized. Funniest Archon by far.


I just realised that's the character switching sound


HOLY CRAP SHE WAS! NO WONDER SHE THREW MORA OUT!


The Melusines are surprisingly agile.


NINJA MELUSINES, ATTACK!


Yeah. That was the highlight of this whole thing for me.


I reckon being chased by multiple cute Chucky-sized humanoids is quite terrifying.


Childe is always looking for a fight, but even he wouldn't dare challenge a horde of Melusines


Oh no. Did Childe   the Melusines?


I've never seen Melusines who run to fast before lmao


not when you realise one of the Melusines (the one on the right with no hat and a old badge) is Carole from Neuvillette's story quest... at least she lives on in a way thanks to Furina's play?


You can also see Navia and Clorinde running in to join the brawl


She does the small female character run lol.


Is this what justice means to you Neuvillette?? Answer me!!


neuvi really said "I am the law" as he kneed some mf


I hope all 4 of them.


OMG PLEASE!!


Childe chose the worst time for his vacation


It only makes sense that they'd bring electro-swing to Fontaine eventually. I absolutely love it lol


That's the good way they can prove to be better than they were. YPC's absence will be felt because of his usual music styles are melodic and catchy.


She also does the same meditation pose as Ei


And why is Childe being chased by Meleusines?


 Indecent exposure


He pissed on the archon


He tries to advocate against Fonta for health reasons and the big Fonta lobbied the government to cancel him.


And then she sends her goons to break the ankles of a poor crab!! When will her crimes end??


she even used rock against a crab in a rock-paper-scissors! How devious!


That seal is a renowned ac-torrr.


She's french-canadian alright...


Couldn't even kill one measly blubberbeast, it's Hoyover boys Furina is ruined.


>Also you can see Furina mimicking the other four archons we’ve met during the swing scene. She copies Nahida’s pose, Venti’s lyre, Ei’s meditation stance, and throws Mora, which isn’t really accurate considering Zhongli’s lack of income

There is also character change sound effect in this scene.


Throwing Mora is very accurate for Zhongli, since he throws around mora without a care in the world, he doesn't understand it's value since he makes it.


childe also drop kicking someone in the background


Another random little detail (though probably obvious) -- the scenes that play out in this demo look not coincidentally similar to the pictures on display at the beginning of Furina's Teaser Trailer...


> Navia and Clorinde arriving late, and then arguing amid the fight

I thought they were taking turns slapping each other.


>and throws Mora, which isn’t really accurate considering Zhongli’s lack of income

Nah. Zhongli DOES have money. He just doesn't know how to handle it, so it's pretty accurate.


Final pose with curtain fall is Hamilton reference?


Now come on now


Childe has just decided to become part of the Fontaine cast and everyone has just accepted it, its so funny seeing him get caught up in it all


They seem to be mimicking other scenes from the game

Childe and the Melusine resemble Nahida as Katheryne getting attacked and stabbed

Neuvillette and Navia are acting out the scene where Signora steals Venti’s gnosis


**Parkour Melusines** from the looks of it, as well. I want that movie. I would pay for that movie.

I mean they just **jumped down a flight of stairs**, ffs.


Jump Jump Kaisen moment


The ending gives me the same vibe with Mr Bean's Holiday ending, where the whole cast randomly broke into the musical scene.


Like Hideo Kojima with Metal Gear Solid V.


Sums her up lol


Broke the number one law in Fontaine. Please do not the melusines


"Please don't the Melusines."


marketing team OP


yep lmao


Perhaps it only translates to Furina of Fontaine?


Idol Furina


What if furina has -1 fans? What if Furina has nan fans? What if Furina has -inf fans? What if Furina has (0.1 + 0.2) fans? What if Furina has √-1 fans? What if Furina has a bathroom?


He did it for justice.

That guy had it coming.

Where Melusines are concerned, no punishment is too harsh


A lot of duality going on between this and the teaser trailer


On Her Archon's Secret Service


Now I want to get all my hydro girls together for a show.

(Everyone in the first three rows, please wear your complimentary ponchos! The water *will* get everywhere.)


I love the dandy vibes


i dunno she has some *stiff* competition from Nahida in the cuteness department.


Now I'm worried about remaining archons. How  the hell can they top this???


That's Furina de Fontaine for you.


The NPCs at the bottom also change to each nation"s


And you can also hear the character change sound lmao


You might even say that it was all just an act!  Wait...


And absolutely violating the carb in a game of rock paper scissors


I mean her teaser was really depressing though


Hey the first two weren’t! It’s just Raiden and Nahida out of 5


Yeah she can switch from dark to light theme


It is her fantasy, she wont dream happily about someone who tried to kill her. =3


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvrW4aKwAXw

After rewatching it, it honestly feels dated compared to the recent ones we got like Neuvillette's or Furina's. Only animation and direction wise, BGM remains so fucking good.


Very unpopular opinion bro, the level of fun is immense. It's not epic nor badass like Raiden but every scene is fun and well thought. This demo is really incredible. Nahida, I don't even remember the demo, only her theme.


Well it's all just a play from her side. A trick. Theatrics. As you probably already noticed... It's not the "real" her.          
I already said too much with that and i don't won't to spoiler anything further of the upcoming 4.2 Quest *but* you'll see what i mean soon enough.               
        
She'll be running for 3 weeks so perhaps go through the Archon Quest first and then decide 😁 There's no rush getting her in the 1st Minute.


Wait and do the new archon quest to see


I mean it was more a homage to vaudeville than solely  Broadway musical or opera


You never listen to vocaloid so.


Which is?


She tried. Sadly, she chose Vivianne of the lake


If I get Furina the first thing I'm doing is letting her be killed by a local legend, as revenge for that crab in her demo.


The vocals came in at literally the exact perfect moment. Wonderful!


Incredible amount of creativity and homages went into this character demo. It also feels so different from other demos and that's saying a lot.


My 230+ fates are ready!

F2P BTW.


Cute in a Marie Antoinette/Britney Spears kinda way.


THANK YOU! The Stage instantly came to mind when I read that


She's Elation follower


I mean... I'd roll with it.  Just give her a strawhat


Chlorinde and Navia look like they're taking turns slapping each other.


Literally that one jojo meme


bro he fucking drop kicked him


>And Neuvillette too kicking the guard at the back.

He freaking kneed him too lmao


Call the ambulance, but not for me.


When some dude says all water tastes the same


Was that Navia and Clorinde just slap fighting eachother??  
That was straight up FF7 flashbacks lmao


and picked rock because crabs can only throw scissors


Undertake fights you know you'll win.

-Sun Tsu or something


🦀


Kani😭


BRATTY CRAB CORRECTION?????


Man finally snapped 💀


I just want to point out the dude Wriothsley was fighting is gone in the wide finale shot where everyone is posing. The Duke straight up murdered that man.


Thats what happens when you mess with the melusines.


In my opinion，Neuvillette and her are two sides of justice. The sovereign protects the weak while the archon plays the heroine. She gave people hope and the ability to believe in justice when the nation seemed to be destined for destruction. People always need to see heroes，especially in times of solitude.


That guy said Melusines are boys and not girls.


>set to comically unfitting background music

Freebird guitar solo is fit for that scene.


Got a link to a clip? Genuinely can’t find one somehow


I cracked up when I saw that. I never expected him of all people to be throwing hands.


I feel like childe getting pursued by the police is very much lore accurate tho


I'm 100% picturing Ei watching this while trying to hold back a smile but Yae Miko is cackling beside her LMAO.


4.

Now give me my Primos.


I heard the noise and almost thought it was my game (I had it on the bf while watching the trailer


I like to think thats how the average citizen of Teyvat sees Morax.  Infinite mora glitch


LOL what? Have to rewatch


The one thing doesn't have and forgot to make to make some for himself


If only youtube allowed 120 fps so you could clearly see her swinging.


Also her poses. Nahida with just the swing. Venti with the Lyre. Ei with her meditation pose and Zhongli with the mora.


you can also hear the character switch sound when she gets off screen


Mildly terrifying yet still cute. Elynas must have been one hell of an abyssal creature


>Mildly terrifying yet still cute. Elynas must have been one hell of an aby

That's probably canonically how thye really are at the police force lol


Theyre part of an investigative police force they might look cute but theyll give you 10 years if you move funny


I mean, they work as police - it's a given they must be skilled


I mean, they work as police - it's a given they must be skilled


Another step toward the reveal that the Marechaussee Phantom is Fontaine's GIGN.


teenage mutant ninja... Melusines?


charged with attempted the melusines


Then they proceed to just start bickering with each other instead, I'm dead.

Meanwhile, Wriothesley just doing Wrio things by uppercutting a dude in style.


Navia and Clorinde running in late instead of fighting to hide their kits (everyone else is auto-attacking in that moment) is insanely funny to me.


The octopus one might trigger *some* people lol.


i was expecting the usual trap beats for archon demos, but changing it up to electroswing with addition of lyrics was the best decision hoyo did


I am disappointed; she should have pulled a sword out.


He knows what he did


I headcanon that Childe saw a Melusine, patted her on the head and said, “Aww, it’s so cute!” which triggered Neuvillette all the way at the court house and he’s being restrained so he doesn’t physically end Childe’s life for not using proper ‘she’ pronouns.


melousines are surprisingly agile


They witnessed his jiggle physics


they ganged up that poor crab


So this is the actual reason for the death sentence.


Forcing Mademoiselle Crabletta into a race war, how cruel can she get?


Why didn't the crab use paper? Is she stupid?


That was a really neat touch


> Parkour Melusines

That's right everyone, it's actually alluding to *District 13*, the 2004 French film that's widely regarded as the premier exhibition of parkour to the wider world. **Hoyo will pull no punches in their references!**


Wait is it mr bean in that's movie goes to france too? Great reference


As punishment, the Melusines will do him.


>"Please don't the Melusines."

what does that mean?


Next thing you're telling me Jeanne d'Arc translates to Joan of Arc.


Yup, you nailed it.  This is "Furina, the idol on the stage" creating a big show; the teaser was "Furina, the god all alone" talking about actors deceiving fate.   Now enter the plot of the final act.  Really well done.

(Also, given that she also literally has the two looks, the two opposing colored eyes, the two Pneuma/Ousia combat modes, and on and on... you'd almost think they're trying to tell us that duality is the entire point/theme of her character...)


Barbara, Furina and Nilou all collaborating on a musical. Sounds like a hype event.


let me correct it


Everything about this demo was genius-ly thought out. When it comes to marketing her in a way that compliments both her character and her role in the game, I genuinely can't see them doing a better job. Their creativity and hard work paid off with this one bc I think this is the best overall community reaction to a demo since Zhonglis. Which is impressive considering how controversial she was right before.


🦀 is kani in Japanese 


And kani sound like...


Oh you sweet summer child, do not look up cute and funny.


She equipped 4 pc Clam set. Right? Right?


I hope they release a full version, this shit absolutely slaps.


Actually even for french natives (at least for me) the accent is a bit tricky with the sound effects and all but I think the singer says:

"Le monde n'est qu'une scène, il vaut mieux rire que pleurer.  
Car le rire est le propre de l'homme.  
Riez de tout cela, ne vous inquiétez pas.  
Profitons d'aujourd'hui"

Which gives something like:

The world is just a stage, and it's better to laugh than to cry.  
For laughter is a human trait.  
Laugh at all this, don't worry.  
Let's enjoy today.


be but with 28

I got this guys


LEZZZZ FACKING GAWWW\~


🤠🪨 ✂️🦀         🤠       🦀💢


He heard someone called water mid


That NPC had it coming. Bullied a Melusine


He had a lot of bottled up emotions after that incident where Traveler and Paimon didn't recognize the exquisite taste of water from Sumeru's Apam Woods.


"I killed a man before, what's one more?" - The Duke probably


Can't wait for someone to put Freebird as the music.


I think he means [this](https://youtu.be/t1WWDBTda2Y?feature=shared) fight scene in the church.


Give him the reins and he'd just power wash the flesh off that poor homie's bones


He would just beat them instead of running


Umm, Melusine is good as detector, but not for fight compare to human. Childe also love to fight first.


Man describes mora as his blood so it makes sense


The blurring was hurting my eye, but I was cackling so it didn't matter that I rewinded that bit


It's the first time that an Archon was shown to know a lot more than their own regions beyond scrying or spy messages — only two were actively wielding their assigned authority ie. Nahida and Ei, while the other two were cosplaying to avoid attention.


I watched the trailer on my phone, I didn't even see the Lyre or the Meditation pose lol.


Since they are so good at noticing blood they are clearly predator race.


It wrecked the entire Fontaine navy, so yeah, probably.


I mean, that is technically Chevreuse's department.


Do not the Melusine


Pretty sure Navia and Clorinde are slapping each other XD


Lesbians.

(I'd put an emoji here, but I can't).


Fuuuuck i understood the reference!!! I am not wholesomeeww hahahahah


So good. I was honestly worried we were going to go all of Fontaine off orchestral and some generic jazz and then they gave the new best Archon an appropriate genre for her nation.

Edit: That might've all been live instrumentation instead of samples. Hoyo could be coming after Caravan Palace's shtick.


Out of *what*, exactly?


He did the melusine


DO NOT THE MELUSINE!! wait.. seigewine uses a hydro vision.. oh.. noo. OH NOOOO


I hear Doro screaming in the distance for some reason.


Following in the footsteps of JJK characters


Celebrities getting cancelled for something I do on a daily basis.


She actually deserves it. What heinous crimes >:(


Off with her ~~head~~ hat.


it's a reference to [please do not the cat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/please-do-not-the-cat) meme


Ah


canny

as in, this can sure is canny


Cute and funny. Nothing else.


Do not cite the deep magic to me, buddy. I was there when it was written.


What's wrong? He just wants some crab.

Maybe some female oysters too. 

~~I will definitely never see the pearly gates when I die.~~


Same! We can do this brother!


You got this, bro/sis~


Me with 40 pulls, 0 pity and a dream


He's had it with Fontainians' obsession with Fonta. Man decided he will show the superiority of pure water through force.


💀


Paimon called water mid like 4  times.


"The power of water, is its ability to throw these hands"


Maybe he did worse. Maybe it was Sigewinne's father. o\_0


if the duke wants somebody dead he needs no justification


Intrusive thoughts: 1

Wrio: 0


Nah, he's talking about [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdIUL8nRrJ0). Fucking killer movie.


Beating melusine? Some Hydro dragon will personally come after him.


Childe is operating with Yugioh 5D's logic.


Neuvillette did say that she was gathering intelligence from across Teyvat even if it was for another purpose, it seems that her sources are better informed than one would think.


I'm pretty sure Clorinde is supposed to be a sort of mother figure to Navia. Especially since she's about twice her age


wait wait wait hold on, explain!


No booba for booba sword

So.. the hat would do


☠️☠️☠️


😭😭😭


Sigewine: "Papa?"


So that's why he was deemed Guilty


He just like me fr


canny also means something nice/good

&#x200B;

as in furina's canny


Oh yeah? Then name the god among men who started this.


thank you for your kind words (at 0 pity F2P and 28 fates)


And did you see Paimon in this demo? She dead now. Case closed


And thats exactly what Childe wants. You think that Childe, battle-hungry ginger, is gonna miss a chance to fight the one person who one-shotted him?


Which is canon


Considering that magical waters tied to region has the ability to... take on any shape, they would blend in easily by flowing through all the channels across Teyvat.

Won't be surprised if the other Archons are aware of her familiars observing them but considered Furina to not be a threat due to some mutual understanding that we're not privy to (yet).


Wouldn't be shocking if she did have spies/informants everywhere.

Even in the start of the Fontaine quests there was someone stalking the traveler in Sumeru


 I think they’re referring to the octopus being considered a symbol of anti-semitism?  Like how recently gretha thunberg faced a lot of backlash for featuring the mood change octopus plushie in the background of one of her pro-palestine posts


Childe running away from childe support.


😧


Don't tell neuvillette

He'll finger you with his charge attack


The crab in general or cute and funny? Never really seen the crab used outside of JPT so probably dorontabi or dikko. Cute and funny has been used for years, especially on 4chan so no clue who started that trend.


Wasn't it Dorontabi?


See now I thought it was a hentai joke-


I thought it was bc Zhongli hates seafood lol


Oh shit, I didn't know there was an issue there. I was thinking of another thing. Oh boy


Oyakodon 😭


how can I unread this from my memory


Obvious upgrades in almost every department.

Nice to see Rgg making tons of new assets out of their comfort zone even when it may be an investment for the future to use Hawaii map more times. 

Story cutscenes, substories everything seems to be of the highest quality

Segway is amazing to use and the auto cruise option is a very nice feature to just roam around in ease and look at the city


Cruising the streets of Hawaii on your segway while listening to Friday Night is peak LaD experience.


Seeing Kiryu sick and running away from fights literally hurts my heart


Got me really hyped up for the game. The world looks really interesting and I can’t wait to explore it. My only concern: I didn’t see a Mahjong parlor. But since there’s shogi I’m pretty sure there’s gonna be a mahjong parlor as well. The 3 substories were really fun and I love the super crazy delivery. Character wise I think this game is gonna be sick chitose and tomizawa seem really interesting and fun to play. I can’t wait to finally get my hands on the game. If it’s really as long as they say then I’ll be really busy trying to get the platinum trophy.

"Jesus christ RGG, please calm the fuck down." has been ringing in my head alot.


kiryus rush style in infinite wealth will be this games head trauma


My favourite part about the new combat is that it gives you a lot more information about what your attacks are going to do. I also like the slight mp restore that i assume all jobs have on normal attacks.


Really enjoyed it. Gameplay-wise a HUGE improvement over 7 with the walk field and combos

Graphic-wise it's also much better. No more blurry 480p textures like 7, we're back to HQ like the other DE games. Ichiban and co. look so good, but there are some lighting issues still present

&#x200B;

My only gripe so far (*besides NPCs just being Japanese but recolored like come on, there's only 3 new American-looking models*) is easily the weather. The rain.... just looks awful. No build-up like small droplets for like 10 seconds or sumn, just appears out of nowhere and in literally 1.4 second, all roads are soaking wet, grass is now green texture, etc. I really hope it gets more visual touches in the final release cuz uhhh.... in the demo I legit hated looking at it

&#x200B;

(*Also no Agent/Dragon style for Kiryu, which would've been a MUCH MORE interesting moveset than reusing 0 styles imo*)


Looks awesome though I purposely didn’t do much of the freeplay demo since I would rather save a lot of that for when the whole game releases.


The voice actor in English for the guy who gets buried in the sand had me dying. The guy is clearly supposed to be like middle school/high school age, but his voice actor sounded like a 3rd grader. It was so weird and out of place, especially since the girl’s voice actor was relatively fine.

Demo was great obviously and I’m pumped. That just really stuck out to me because of how off it felt lol.


I’m making myself abstain. I don’t believe progress carry’s over and I’m just going to go insane wanting to play the game If I try it and put it down.


0/10 No Seong-Hui


I wasn't very hyped as Gaiden reminded me of how much I love the real time combat of the series, but the demo hyped me so much I had to turn it off after 30mins as it will only make me crave playing the full game more and it's still months away.

I really, really hope we can get control Kiryu and use him to explore and do sub stories.


For the little I played it, I liked what I saw. Things as simple as the coconut trees had me amazed tbh. But when I got around to play it, it made sure to show me that I needed to upgrade my rig... AND SO I DID... Now I'm in *Like a Dragon: Infinite Debt*


YOURE WELCOME TO STAY HERE IF YOU NEED A *RUFF* OVER YOUR HEAD.

ANY FRIEND OF HIS IS A FRIEND OF *MINE*


Starting the series with 7 into every installment and finally into this demo has made me realized I did actually appreciate the change to turn based 

It was a really fresh experience playing the demo 

Hawaii was beautiful too, my only complaints was beating the boss in fight then the cutscene just ignores it ever happening


As much as I didn't like the gameplay of 7, it was really boring to just spam head trauma and that's it, the gameplay for infinite wealth seems much much better, with controlling the characters and having more options with regular attacks than just using skills every time I'll have much better time, the substories seem excellent as always and other characters also seem very interesting, I would say it could be my favorite Yakuza game, even tho I like brawler style more than turn based rpg


I like Kiryu's battle mechanics

Yamai is voiced by Takehito Koyasu, enough said


Talking to Hawaiian NPCs in Japanese is immersion breaking but it makes sense gameplay and localisation wise


Kiryu's grey pants and black shirt are drippy af.


I'm very encouraged by almost everything. My one thing I'm not entirely sure about is that Hawaii feels like it will be huge, and I already thought Yokohama was too big for my liking. I'm not really a big map guy. Kamurocho and Sotenbori are perfect for me. 

I realize I'm probably in the minority on that though.


I hate that i cant save in the demo. (It's not just me, right?) And the graphics sometimes look... not so good... like when they level up, it looks so CRUNCHY 😭 but other than that, i cant wait. Its also just so surreal theyre using my hometown as a map!


I haven't touched it because I know for a fact i'm going to love it, and I also know that I will not want it to end, which will make the wait for January that much more painful.. I also don't want to prematurely burn myself out (which yakuza does tend to do if you play too much of it) and then I don't feel like redoing progress in January... so i'm living vicariously through all of you.

I avoid demos for this reason.


Loved it. I’m not one of the people who complained about the 7’s battle system being kinda janky or whatever but I do think the upgrades like being able to move your character (and movement radius being a stat that levels up) and knowing when your attack will pick up an item etc. benefit the game greatly. Am mostly excited to get back to turn-based Yakuza again as well since 7 was my entry into the series (and have since slowly marathoned all the other entries + the Judgment games too these past 3.5 years)


Refusing to play it. I rather have the full game than just snippets, even if I have to wait.


It was good and fun plus i love chitose and eng dub🤮 sorry ya’all just imo


Also I'm really digging Kiryu's hairstyle, growing to love it


I really enjoy the English dub for this (even Yong Yea kinda sounds good in some cases.) The Japanese dub is as always really good as well but considering that they stated doing English dubs not too long ago it’s really cool to hear that stuff.


It got me so hyped that I just pre ordered it. I usually never pre order games and have only done so on two occasions, namely infinite wealth now and Gaiden a couple months back. I regret neither.


Only played the Hawaii demo and I'm hyped. I'm just not sold on the Hawaii map yet.. It has the same issues I have with the Yokohama map. It's too big for that cozy neighbourhood feeling of Kamurocho, and too small for me to get lost in it. Overall it's very horizontal with long and wide streets and a lack of small alleyways. Also, many of the stores are not enterable, but that could be work in progress thing.


 It sold me on the game. Not completely but I’m ready to sink 100+ hrs back into an Ichiban adventure


Awesome. Glad we can play as turn based kiryu


How long is the demo? Is it like a whole chapter?


The combat is way fun than 7 especially with the regular attack. I love the walkman function with music and segway, reminds me of Fallout series, though I'm kinda looking forward to the language barrier issue but I didn't see any, as an immigrant I always love to see such things in medias.


It honestly feels like they made 7 again but theres way more now


How long is the demo?


I didn't wanna touch the demo, I wanted to go in blind, but the buddy that has been watching me play all the rest of 'em really wanted to see it so I obliged.  I didn't do a lot of exploring because of that, but what I saw and experienced was really good.  The combat overall feels like a step up from 7, and the way Kiryu works is SO COOL to me x)  Looks beautiful, feels great, I had and still have no doubts this is gonna be an awesome game!

This is also a little off topic, and also probably just wishful thinking, but I'm hoping the fact they chose Hawaii as the location was because they're also humoring the idea of a Y3 Remake.  Both because remakes are really taking a stage and hyping people up atm, and because Ryu-kyu always made me think of my time on Waikiki beach.  So I got this little inkling that maybe, *just maybe*, they're trying to get some assets set up for that.  Again, I suspect that is just wishful thinking, but I'm putting it out there and crossing my fingers because it deserves it xD 

But regardless of if that truly happens or nah, Y8 is gonna be so good.  As much as I loved 7, I think this one is going to be even better in so many ways.


Now, we won't know until we actually have the game in our hands proper, but I wanna say this about the demo.

I love how they rebalanced combat. Obviously this is a demo and so our movepool is very limited right now, but what I really loved about the demo was how they actually gave you legit reasons to use the Attack command in different contexts. One of my problems with the first game was that while it was a fun RPG, I didn't like how as you leveled up, and gained so much MP, that you would end up never using the Attack command. I found that I was only ever normally attacking an enemy when they were downed for that bonus damage.

I'm so so happy they now have an on-screen prompt for when you're able to pick up objects or perform heat actions. One of my problems about this mechanic was that because it was unclear when you could ever use them, most weapon attacks felt incidental and rare. Now you can actually strategize a little bit with knockback, combo attacks, weapon attacks, and your skills use a lot of MP too, so you really have to conserve and use regular attacks more. I really dig it, it adds much needed depth to the combat. 

Amazing game, I can't wait to play it. The only thing that might potentially bother me a little bit is the fact that it's set in Hawaii, it's super cool but also I admit I did feel like a little bit of that Japanese tourism charm is lost now that we're in America. Admittedly it's Hawaii, but I remember walking into a convenience store in the demo and joking about how it looks like your typical American gas station food mart.


I didn't really dig in to the second half of the demo because I wanna save some stuff for the full release. I liked what I saw in the story section though. I was not expecting it to pick immediately after Gaiden's post credit scene, that was cool. Being able to move in combat is a great addition, gives you a lot more control and options for strategy. I think this game is gonna be a real good one, I'm really excited.


Adding a button to say hey to people is gonna get a shit ton of use out of me lol


Segway


Good but there's some iffy things I dont like. 

The poundmate cutscenes are a bit too long (so far the main egregious one being nancy and olivia). 

Movement in combat is a good step in the right direction but you don't move far enough to make combat interesting and since enemies move around despite it not being their turn itmakes critical thinking a friggin nightmare.

The Segway movement option is nice to have but why have a battery?? It doesn't last as long as you'd like, and without tricks like Yagami's skateboard it's not that nice to use. Customization on it is nice but I wish there was a boost function for skill based movement like Yagami's tricks.

Lastly, Ultimates don't seem like much except Kiryu's but I'm chalking that up to it being the beta.


Kiryu seems broken af with his brawler shit you can activate. I used it in battle and deleted all enemies in a few seconds lo0l.


As a Hawaii local, born and raised, from the announcement that it was set in part here, I was hyped. I only played a little of the demo so far but the somewhat weird usage of pidgin (some things are fine, others are a lot more ridiculous) just made me laugh so damn much. Seeing them use "fakas" made me bust out laughing. I love it to death. With how color coordinated some groups of enemies are, it's like you get da ABC Store crew beefing out da Hilo Hattie crew or maybe both of . It's so damn good. Very much looking forward to how Ala Moana is going to be, assuming that large area to the west is supposed to be that.


Loved 7 and its characters. The gameplay is solid but I hope this new cast grows on me. I know it’s just a demo but I feel like Saeko and Adachi should be standing in the place of these newbies. “heiress”? Give me my relatable office lady! 

I know Japan loves Hawaii and everyone and their dog has been there but I’m just not a fan of the American setting. I’m sure once it releases my doubts will be quelled but for now I’m a little underwhelmed. That could be because the ending of Gaiden hit me so hard though.


Is there some kind of reward for beating the demo?


In terms of systems I'm digging the incredible upgrades across the board, they've added a ton of features and assets which is always a fun surprise when the expectation is they won't. The presentation of everything is superb and I'm excited for the full release

Frankly though, the Hawaii setting isn't as effectively weaved into the gameplay sensation as well as Japan, specifically the denser and detailed districts like Kamurocho and Sotenbori or the more exotic ones like Okinawa. A big part of the other games appeal is that I felt like I was a real inhabitant of these places and it was like a stylized daily-life simulation (albeit of someone with a very different position in life than me) in addition to a brawler. I simply don't get the same feeling in Hawaii. I think it's the result of a team recreating what they know vs trying to recreate what they think they know, and the result feels a bit like a Japanese caricature of Hawaii. Just because of my reservations about how the implementation of the setting impacts the believability, I doubt I'd have the same attraction to the series if this was my introduction to it.

YongYea also doesn't inflect like Kiryu would, as if he doesn't understand the mannerisms of the character, which is the main thing to dislike about his performance. It's a shame because his lines ping pong between "almost good" and bafflingly bad while the other actors are knocking it out of the park. Playing the game with Japanese audio is fine as that's how it was intended, but the localization of Y7 really worked to make jokes and emotional scenes pop more for Anglophone audiences so it's too bad one of the voice actors is lagging the effort


I'm pissed the trailer spoiled that thing about Kiryu. He said he was car sick but you know what's up damnit. I can't get that out of my head but so far it's really good. Taking photos of weirdos and learning about Hawaiian cuisine. Delicious Lau Lau 🤤


I don’t really care for the game and also 7 and I’ll probably just be watching a full game movie when it drops, but it is definitely an improvement over 7.


I want the brawler combat system back!!! 

But anything else is ok...


Gameplay is sick! 

And the minigames 10/10


I didn’t like LAD 7 so I probably won’t pick this up either.


Loved the short story demo, however the game does look a little unpolished at times (graphics wise) like the lack of shadows in some parts and the lighting being a little iffy at times as well as ichi’s running animation looking a little different, but hey it’s a demo anyway it’ll be better when the real thing comes out


I only played the story demo and it looks interesting so far  
The Hawaii setting feels a little weird after the very strikingly Japanese settings of the previous games, however  
Feels a bit like I'm playing a bootleg GTA or something  
But I assume this is just a matter of getting used to  
Already preordered the game anyhow


Where can I play the demo?


I can't wait for the full game. The demo is tons of fun. My only complaints are the blue effect that they put during battles, which looks pretty bad Imo, and the english dub which is poorly done, specially that scene where Ichiban laughs, but he doesn't make a sound. Hopefully they fix the dub by the time the game comes out.

&#x200B;

I love the setting, being able to move during your turn, the new characters are fun, Hawaii looks great, although perhaps a little too bright. The delivery minigame is great, while the other one is ok I would say.

&#x200B;

I have very high hopes for this game given how much I loved Yakuza 7


If anyone played it on ps5/series x is there a resolution /performance or is it like ishin/gaiden with only the standard 60fps mode? Thanks In advance.


amazing.


Haven't touched the story demo and probably won't so I can experience it all on release but the Hawaii demo is soooo fun!

The karaoke seemed very easy though.. at least compared to any other game, perhaps that will change on release because it seems way too easy and simple lol

I love how goofy it is and it reminded me of why LAD7 was one of my favourite games ever

I love walking around pressing X and saying hello to people lmao


This exact question crossed my mind earlier today


The story demo was perfect for giving us a setup for the characters and tease us with a villain while letting us try out the combat which remains awesome.


It was pretty interesting. I wish we had more content storywise but what's there is pretty good. I didn't a chance to do some of the other mini games but the substories were good. I played it English. Ichiban's va sounds great as always but you could tell that it's an early dub and I'm not talking about kiryu (I think Yong yea is fine and there were scenes where his voice acting really fit kiryu) but there's some characters were it's a bit awkward or there's some minor mistakes (one that pops up is the revolve bar bartender says ruff instead of roof in one scene lol) but I'm impressed so far and I'm probably gonna preorder it when I can.


I haven’t played it yet because I don’t know what the difference is between story demo and Hawaii demo


GTA VI WHO?


I need MORE


You got to experience what the game had to offer in (most) areas and it was great there are some things that touched up but otherwise the game is definitely ready.


There seems to be A LOT to do.


It wont open
(Yes i have beaten gaiden)


It's a massive upgrade, both in gameplay and actually, optimization

Combat feels smooth, there's more aspects to it including positioning, and abilities seem less "Same thing but better" so far at least, Plus the addition of mana regen on autoattacks for all class types is welcome considering i felt like casters being the only ones that never needed mana consumables felt weird.

the game runs better, loads faster, and looks nicer than 7 did on the exact same machine i played it with, and i'm so god damn excited for January.   


wish we could see how job swapping works in the demo though, i'm hoping it's not like hello work from 7 again


I'm still on chapter 3 of gaiden. Got lots of side content to still do before I continue the story. I hear the demos are good but sega being dumb about what streamers can show mostly the story demo the Hawaii demo is fair game so I wonder what exactly the story demo is. Is it just cutscenes or is it literally the beginning of the game.


They actually made the combat better and more interactive and now I honestly have no complaints.


No lie, this is the best turn-based combat has ever felt for me, and I've loved the genre for a decade now.


I started the demo and stopped after I stopped at Richardson's bar for some Karaoke. 

I want to discover the rest when the game is out.


had a great time with it. Hawaii is a cool place to explore and a Honolulu is a good first city outside Japan. Still feels a little weird seeing USD instead of yen in these games but that's just something to get used to. Segueways are nice for navigating big cities similar to Lost Judgments skateboard. I liked the new mini games and the substories in the demo were fun. 

I love the new additions to the turn based combat system. 7 has a decent first attempt for turn based combat, but it definitely had room to improve and develop it's own identity. Proper movement during battles is exactly what 7 was missing from its combat, and now it's much more thoughtful and dynamic. With mechanics like how your position changes how you attack, knocking enemies into objects like walls or into a teammate or other enemies to do more damage, and the meter for tag team specials, there's a lot more going on in the combat and I can't get enough of it.


nothing, haven't seen/played it yet


The demo is so freaking fun that I had to stop myself from playing more and went back to installing LAD and replaying it. My hype for Infinite Wealth is...well infinitely high.


Not going to bother with it, I'll just wait to play the full thing when it comes out.


am hyped


Kiryu skinny af


Late but whatever. Really loving the demo, stoked for the game, but I have this one nitpicky issue RGG keeps not addressing. Please. Put a delay on encounter groups spawning back in. Seriously, so sick of beating some bad guys too close to their initial spawn and then they're immediately present after the fight so I have to run away to avoid aggro again. Just like 10 seconds would be enough!


Judgment 3 will definitely be set in Hawaii.


you can >!customise the segway too which is dope.!<


Maybe not Hawaii, but I can think of a certain aging numbered game also set in a tropical environment that is begging for a Kiwami entry…


Feels like Arthur Morgan all over again.


Literally 5 years ago (20 minutes for us) he was just casually strolling into Omi HQ and bust some heads with the bros. It hurts so much seeing him being reduced to a husk of himself in terms of health


I'm pretty sure RGG Studio would sooner make a Like A Dragon game without combat than one without mahjong.


I saw a mahjong parlor but it was beyond the playable demo area iirc.


Is there Cho-Han or cee lo? I’m sick of all these newer RGG games not having the two best gambling games.


When the worst problem a series has is that it has too many bangers should be a testament to the quality of the games


Feel like they are going with the LJ's "We don't give a shit about balance" philosophy for IW.


My only issue is with the button prompts during special attacks. The timings of Y/Triangle prompts feel REALLY off and the game doesn’t tell you which prompt you will need to press in the special attacks menu. Honestly, I would much rather an option that automatically completes QTEs like Lost Judgment and Isshin, I hate doing them.


Oh if they gave all jobs mana restore that'll allow me to use so many other jobs...

In Like a Dragon I basically had to force everyone that wasn't Ichiban to have a job that could either heal the party or restore mana.


Oh my god, the models are fucking hilarious. There’s one woman on the beach who seemingly is supposed to be black or Hispanic, but she’s clearly just a japnese woman with the bodybuilder “not quite black face” skin color.


I mean, full version could very well have the agent job, I would actually be surprised if it doesn't


Maybe Kiryu I mean Taichi has a memory sequence later of his Daidoji training and unlocked agent as a full job


I really hope that Agent is also a job for Kiryu, considering that’s literally his job when Kasuga is not having a schizo episode


Oh hi Dasta lol


I was on the beach when it started raining and I know sand darkens when it gets wet but it looked super unnatural and weird. It reminded me funnily enough of chapter 5 in Gaiden where you go to Omi HQ and the shadows just disappear.


> The rain.... just looks awful.

Bruh, in the story demo it rained as I was going to Kiryu's car at the hotel and after walking like 2 feet under the overhang of the hotel the rain just...disappeared. Like I could clearly hear it but not see it.


The people in the sand was hilarious caught me so off guard.


It was like the opposite of the Ono Michio substory in 6 where you had these 8 year olds that were so painfully obviously voiced by middle aged men 💀


glad im not the only one lol i couldnt bring myself to play it for any more than like 30 minutes cuz i would just be jonesing for the next 2 months for the full release


Now you must pursue the infinite wealth to pay off the infinite debt to finally become like a dragon


yeah that was weird. My guess is in the final game we don't actually fight this boss until later.


I assume they’ve put the boss fight in the demo specifically, but in the game it won’t be there, that’s why the cutscene shows him standing there and only his goons fighting


Yeah that part confused me. But I'm really liking this Yamai character! I've seen people mention he'll be like the "new Majima". So I'm curious to seeing more of him. 😊


The two sub stories by the beach were fucking hilarious.


Dio is everywhere!
He did a great job in Kiwami 2-- so happy to see him back.


Honestly, when I opened the map I was like "damn that's kinda small, I hope the full version will be bigger." I got accustomed to Yokohama being gigantic and the Hawaii demo map really seemed small compared to that. Maybe the full version will be bigger but I also wouldn't mind it staying that way after thinking about it a bit, considering Yokohama will probably return too


I like the dub too. You're not alone.


I also feel like Ichibans English VA really fits his character, kind hoping this new cast is good for both dubs.


I hope the stores are enterable too in the full game.It'll be disappointing to have this new full map just not to be able to look around the stores.


There’s two, a story demo and free roam demo

Story demo is probably like 25 minutes (there’s a very short section that lets you roam a small area)

The free roam demo’s length is basically infinite, but confines you to the lower right of the map and only has a small number of sub stories for you to do


about half an hour for the story one. its obviously some cutscenes taken out for the demo but it's still interesting and fun

the hawaii one is a small free roaming one where you can go to a boss but also a few mini games and has 3 substories, and can change jobs and such. theyre both great and it took me 2 hours to give the whole thing a shot


Fellow local here. I imagine lotsa ppl gonna be confused with the dialogue. I loled when that taco guy said da kine 😭


It kinda is for like 30 seconds every now and then. 

And unless the game had Kiryu and Ichi in completely separate stories like 0 I doubt it would ever pan out like that, having a brawler game. Even then it would be only 50% 

I would say just enjoy the hundreds of hours of brawler games we already have including literally every yakuza game excluding 7 at this point, and the judgement games.


It won't. Stop whining.


Then why comment? Lmao


u can play it after beating gaiden


After beating Gaiden.


There is cutscenes+gameplay in it from what I can tell its very early on in the game it seemed like Ichi and Kiryu just arrived in Hawaii.There is a lot of context missing though it seemed like the story demo was near the end of a chapter maybe chapter 2 if I was to guess?


and worried about kiryu, i do not buy that whole motion sickness


I dont know if you've seen but theres a mechanic thats called smackdown they introduced where you can instantly kill weaker enemies the trade off is you get less money/Exp.


Please god give us judgment 3 🙏🏻


That’s if RGG settled whatever is wrong with yagami’s actor and the use of his likeness then hopefully we get judgement 3 next year lol


Lets fucking goooooooooo!


Nah man, with Yakuza 8 setting in Hawaii RGG studios wants to show us that every thing is possible.

That's why Judgement 3 will be set in Ohio.


Future Like A Dragon will have Mahjong-based combat.


Fun > Balance


Yeah, that’s my pet peeve too. Y prompt was on point in Y7 but I can’t even hit once in Y8. Plus, they didn’t say this but Royal Guard is also back


Haven't tried it myself but there is a setting to disable combat prompt in the menu. Maybe that's what it is for?


Or, you know, just chug 50 gallon of Tauriner down everyone’s throat after a fight


It's like single digits in the demo but you can recover from follow up attacks and such


All the NPC model budget went into that one white woman in the teaser that saw Ichiban's bat


To be fair all npcs have looked bad in the series.


Chitose Buster Holmes?


Yeah, it's pretty lazy.

They honestly could've just bought assets on the internet and tweaked them.

That said, I'm willing to bet what makes them able to produce these games so quickly and with quality is due to them re-using these assets to save time/money for other elements like gameplay, mini-games, or story.


My theory is that Agent was originally a job for IW but they loved it so much they made it the basis for Gaiden.


Taichi?? Joryu already exposed?


That's rad!


Was that the English or Japanese? I played everything except 7 in Japanese. I only did the demo in English because it’s Hawaii, and I’d like to play the English if it’s decent since it makes sense. 

Tbh though, I wish there was a “mixed” option where Americans speak English and Japanese speak Japanese. Would be weird though when it’s kiryu talking to Richardson or something though lol.


![gif](giphy|5W7aqAZvYZEAneyryt|downsized)


Yamai or Roman? Yamai then yeah. He looks like Mabuchi/Ishioda midgame boss to me (probably same with Dwight and Jack Ma) while Ebina and Sawashiro looks like the endgame bosses


Ikr, I loved with people in the sand especially, itchiban was equally shocked as was I lmao


A lot of the areas are blocked off honestly Hawaii is massive if you scroll through the whole map and look where the other mini games are.


Yeah, I'm factoring in the additional sections that seem to exist based on what we've seen and how the map looks. I'm projecting a bit so I might not be entirely accurate, but it feels like the full thing will be absolutely gigantic. Because the demo area is a relatively small part and is still decently big.


I see, thanks.


Ah thank god, I was expecting it to be a bit longer and when I heard progress might not carry over i decided not to play it but since it's so short might as well give it a go!


Wait. How do I change jobs? I couldn't figure that out. Which ones are available in the demo?


That ability is a joke... if only ichiban had been fan of virtua fighter... but he decided to like dragon quest... damn xD...

Yeah the thing is, 10 years (in the joint) or more always at the expectation of a new adventure to clean the cities by fist... and now is all gone... 

RGG: The Studio That Erased His Identity.


Likewise! Stop whining that people feel this way (especially on an opinion post). Yakuza was a *brawler system game first* and was much more engaging for it as is evident in gaiden/Lost Judgment. 

I don't hate the turn based system, but even with the new revisions/updates LAD did not need to become a slog because of April fools joke. As much as I love persona or dragon quest, Yakuza/LAD had its own identity in the brawler system, and it was a unique break away from other RPG turn-based games that suffer story pacing issues because of it.


is not whining, is just that we lost our main and well done brawler... all action rpg nowadays comes with the guy with a sword or shooters everywhere... cleaning the cities by fist was and is still a rare thing... and now is gone...

Right now, RGG just became another one of those generic rpgs (by its combat sys) and they use kiryu to lure us in...

Just in case, I don't dislike the combat system... is just that they were the only series that the main character fights fair with "only" his fists... and now is trapped on a "choose your ability" screen... all the motion is gone, just get better by grinding... everything went so weird since Nagoshi left the studio...


He asked what the thoughts were. LAD 7 didn’t impress me. This game isn’t THAT much different.


don't think I'm that far yet. Nice! This does help a bit. But still not a fan of the immediate respawning. (I did play Yakuza 7, if it was in that, I just forgot)


[deleted]


That issue's long been settled though? That's why we already have PC ports of both Judgment games. >!And considering two characters from Judgment just appeared in Gaiden, I doubt they're done with the series.!<


The whole reason we have PC ports now is because there's been a HUGE shake-up in J&A after countless allegations (they're now rebranded as 2 companies. A reparation company known as Smile-Up and a new talent agency with a yet announced name)

Seems like the new CEO and VC are way more chill with PC stuff, however I do think the wait for J3 will be slightly longer, give it 2 more years


I took his face being plastered all over Gaiden as something that works on multiple layers.


LaD 13 changes the protag again and we get a character who's not a yakuza, they're just playing mahjong completely unrelated to any criminal organization plots


My genuine reaction to that information

Ichiban: Ron!! Riichi, Ippatsu, Tsumo, Tanyao, Dora Ni, Haneman!!!

Boss: Ahhhhhhh!!! \*dies


I have played 8 of these goddamn games and I still cannot understand Mahjong.


>Mahjong-based combat

*looks at Qingque from Honkai Star Rail*


And your dialogue choices are done through Japanese card games played by homeless men


So, Honkai Star Rail?


every single time


Like it should be


Hitting Y a split second before you would in Y7 seems to work consistently, but it still feels so weird and doesn’t match up with the timing on the screen. 

Btw do you mean perfect block by royal guard (I haven’t played the og DMC games so idk if they’re similar mechanics lmao)? I love that mechanic, adds an extra sense of control to the combat


Nah I believe that was in Y7 as well and enabling it there would have the same effect as missing the prompts and doing less damage


Yeah, busted ass NPCs are nothing new for Yakuza. I just found it funny they used so many of the Japanese models, either leaving them the same or making some slight changes that make them look incredibly weird. I expected they’d make new, busted ass American models lol.


No, I’m talking about the people walking around on the street and beach. Chitose looks great because she’s a unique model they put time into since she’s a poundmate (and I’m assuming in the intro substory for poundmates in Hawaii, like gary was).


For sure. Yakuza NPC models have always been pretty rough. I just think it’s funny they colored the Japanese models for a game in Hawaii lmao.


Oh, the beginning of his vacation, Hanawa gives Joryu the ID for Taichi Saizuki


It would make sense Right? The game with a job system will 100% have multiple jobs. MAYBE EVEN A POCKET CIRCUIT FIGHTER!

OMG


Japanese, 6 didn’t have an English dub. https://youtu.be/oy1TM3Hd0hk?si=J8v_K6yRJYHlz9_B


Yamai of course


Plus there’s the entire island mode as well which lets you swim around rivers and stuff.


Yea I think it was just my first impression, I didn't really get much into actually scrolling and zooming etc but it still looks very good so far


sorry i havent played a couple weeks, but its at the bottom left of the available map i think. samurai for guys and geodancer for chitose


There's a reason why it's turn based. Brawler style wouldn't work with Ichiban. He wants to be a hero.


If you want brawler style, just go play Judgement


Brawler style was Kiryu. Turn based is Ichiban. Different main character. Different style. Understand?


Kiryu's turn is over. It's Ichiban's turn as the main character now.


you're good bro you have the right to express your opinion.Dont mind that other dude lol.


Wrong.  There's a lot of improvements. You all are just blind just because it's turn based


its not in the demo but itll be in the full game.Nah it wasnt in 7.


..well it's a spin off


Hopefully all the bullshit getting sorted will also finally allow for Karaoke to be in Judgement, it's absolutely wild that they not only have a professional singer as the main character, but one from hands down the biggest group Asia has ever had and they weren't allowed to have him sing. They had their own weekly show for decades, there was even concern it would impact the economy when they split up, that's how big they were, and he couldn't sing a single note in the game.


Aren’t there >!3 characters from Judgment in Gaiden? Iirc the entire gang except Yagami are in!<


That was honestly one of the most hype moments of the entire series for me. As soon as I saw that >!flashy orange shirt!< I squealed.


>!three!<


Can't wait to play as an old geezer who plays mahjong all day


Final bosses are an old man with a pointy nose, a notorious cheater and a high school girl without panties who keeps killing you with rinshans.


Happy Tears?


Every punch kick even grab is a mahjong tile gacha, just the way mahjong intended lmao


Ah ok thx,I'm starting gaiden soon just gotta finish up 7


Kiryu whips out a pair of Pocket Circuit Cars, uses them like rollerskates and charges the enemies!

ESSENCE OF CHAMPION CIRCUIT


Ah okay, I just don’t remember that one then. I’ll have to watch lol. Certainly isn’t the first Yakuza has had questionable voice acting. “Nowwww, boyyyyyy.”


Thanks. I'll check it out when I return home. Must've missed that on the map!


I actually love turn based games. I play them all the time. The problem is, the “improvements” are not improvements on the reasons why I think LAD7 is both a shitty turn based game, and a shitty Yakuza game relative to other entries.


thx for info :). I watched the big trailers from the RGG summit (that story demo revealed WAY too much, but gameplay demo was good). Still, clearly I've forgotten a bunch. this time I'm gonna say that's a good thing.


A side case... if you will


That's exactly why he doesn't sing. His acting and singing contracts are going to be entirely different worlds of expense.

He doesn't really do the sort of uber expensive live action roles, primarily focusing on yearly dramas and adverts. So it's very likely his likeness and VO rights were straightforward.


>>!the entire gang!<

This is Tsukumo erasure


That's correct >!Kaito, Higashi and Sugiura are in !<


That kinda bother me because i wished kiryu would meet yagami at least once before whatever is gonna happen to him in 8. But i guess his actor is too expensive.


Yeah, and we know damn well they aren’t gonna use Takuya Kimura’s likeness for just some substories and reused voice lines.


Tanimura is back let's gooooooo


I was thinking he would set up a whole race track and the cars would fly into the air, pelting the enemies with multiple cars.


[removed]


A sub story, if I may


At this point I’ll be fine with Kaito being the new protagonist


He doesn't sing because the agency he was with literally wouldn't let him sing outside of Asia, they wouldn't even allow his picture to be used outside of Asia, that's why there's publicity shots of the Judgment cast where he's completely coloured grey. 

They weren't allowed to even attempt to negotiate a contract where he sings, never mind find out how much it would be.


he's just canonically at his desk


Also >!Akame has a Takaya Kimura vinyl in her office lol!<


I'm hoping he appears in infinite wealth. I'm hoping Haruka goes to him to find Kiryu once it's known he is alive.


100% he will get an Ono Michio job I can already see it coming.


If that’s what you want to assume. But people can have differing opinions. LAD 7 is different from other turn based games, and I don’t prefer those differences. It’s not that deep.


I don't think any one of the crew can be a full main protagonist tbh.

- Kaito's got muscle, but he's more inclined to let others do the talking and thinking. He's good for something as short as the Kaito Files, but he can't carry a whole thirteen chapters on his own.

- Sugiura makes a good case, being the smartest of the original four and most similar to Yagami's fighting styles, but his character arc concluded in JE. He'd need a serious backstory bump or new motivation to step up as _the_ lead.

- Higashi is an interesting option. The way he's been written leaves him room to grow as a team member without being such a hardass, and he could have an arc about bringing the Matsugane stragglers into the Yokohama security agency Watase and Daigo were working on. Other than that, he's not got much else to do. He works better on Kaito's level, such as their stint in Sotenbori.

- Tsukumo is destined to be the Guy in the Chair. There's no way he'd learn the combat needed to play as a main character, unless he hits the gym and pumps _insane_ iron. Any segments where you could play as him would be best relegated to technology and puzzles, like infiltration or support for the crew.

What I'm saying is, a game where each of the four has their own chapters and segments would be refreshing. None of them can carry a game on their own, but all four of them can make a _banger_ of an ensemble.


This is a misunderstanding. It's not an inability to be shown, it's that Japan is much stricter with public figure likeness rights and they (being SEGA) would have needed to pay for the right to show him.


Is not him


And the Vampire


And other turn based games are different from other turn based games as well. Your point is?


You should play Gaiden and you’ll realize Kaito talks more and he’s more “charming” than Yagami when speaking with someone


Any of them could be a protagonist of a Gaiden.


Nah


# F U C K


It's actually a cool tactic. It allows new fans from Y:LAD to have a taste of Kiryu's journey and make them check out the previous games.

It's like: "Hey, you want to play this demo of our second game starring our likable schizo protag? Sit down son, and enjoy this little side story of our previous protag and hopefully, we got you hooked on the rest of his past tales on the other 7 games"


I think if they keep doing these "Special Trial Versions," unlocking afterwards is better.

There's going to be content in this that may or not be in the final game, calling it a demo and treating it as such may be seen as misleading.


It's a cool bonus. Maybe they could release the demo later and just have early access to the demo as a thanks for playing. But it does make sense they'd put the demo in Gaiden as it's supposed to be something to play in the lead up to infinite wealth


I mean the general consensus among fans and other gamers is that it's a great move that has become extinct recently. So everyone is just praising it. 

Also I think they should do these type of demo's only for relevant game sequals


I mean I think every game series not just Yakuza games should have a demo separate from any previous title because it gives a hesitant buyers a reason to buy or not to. 

I don’t know how realistic it is for every future Yakuza game to have a demo for the next game attached to it because I don’t think they’ll always be developing two games at the same time like they’re doing now with Gaiden and Y8. However as a fan that it’s cool because I’m excited for Y8 and the game won’t come out until a few months after Gaiden so at least I’ll be able to see how the game is like before then.


the early 2000s are back.... so yeah... i like this.


It's probably like Kingdom Hearts 0.2 fragmentary passage, where it is like a tech demo but part of the overall story of the game.


I dont think they should do this with all upcoming games. Gaiden is a special case as it acts as away to fill the player in about what kiryu has been up to between the events of yakuza 6 and 7. It's only natural that a rgg would take the advantage by giving people a demo of lad8 considering it's the next game chronologically. It's a very good sales tactic plus it gets people that liked lad7 to look forward to lad8. It's an awesome move and I hope they do something like this in the future for other special releases.


Better than the time you had to buy Final Fantasy Type-0 for the FF15 demo.

The motion blur... it hurt...


games used to do this all the time so I feel nothing


I actually freaking LOVE THIS. Reminds me of older games that had a small demo of other games within them.


Demos should be separate


I just want a demo for gaiden.


I'm grateful for it.  Just wish there was a physical release, but I'll get over that.


Rgg kind of makes games too fast to do something like this all the time like if we think about it realistically how often do they have anything that resembles their next game a year in advance


I think it's work great as a bonus. Nobody will die for a lack of demo and it's a nice bonus for the buyers.


Reminds me of old PS2 games that would come with a little demo disc of an upcoming game. I like it!


i like it, it's like a post credit scene from a movie


i always hate free stuff and nice goodies my favourite game series gives me. so i really hate it. they should close sega for that


It’s cool but I’m not gonna play the demo. I want to go into 8 blind


I’m not a huge fan because demos are usually free but you have to buy Gaiden to play this one.


Great call. Please don’t flame me, but I love the RPG take on Yakuza and I like the brawler one too but not as much as the RPG. I was on the fence about getting Gaiden anytime soon- this might have convinced me to get it day 1.


Scummy


Not too sure. Maybe because this one doesn’t start Ichiban so they might have worries on the sales? Ishin did okay but not like some super number.


Not cool from a casual perspective but from a fan perspective yes its very cool.


Considering the lack of a physical release *&* how much it costs in Australia, still a hard pass for me


I think it should be seperate. People who don't want to play the demo would just get this as bloat for gaiden


i think it's cool because it'll make more people buy gaiden just to get a taste of lad8


I like it. I'm unsure if I'll get infinite wealth. This lets me test it on a game I am going to get.


do I need to pre order gaiden to access it or is it available to the public?


I'd like to see what's in the trial first. Maybe they're doing this to avoid major spoilers or something.


I think this is just a special ocation.  A one time only because both games are close to release


They do say that because its a “special trial” it will have bonus content that doesn’t appear on the main game. So maybe some kind of prologue or just a dungeon that is made specifically for the demo


Reminds me of back in the day when certain games came with demos. Resident Evil 1 Directors Cut coming with the RE2 demo comes to mind.
I do prefer separate free demos but this gives ppl a reason to check out gaiden i guess.


Feel like this is getting popular with Japanese studios. Platinum did it with bayonetta 3 and it’s spin off


I don't mind that as timed exclusive until LAD 8 came out, since you can't really play LAD 8 until then and it's more of a glimpse into the next game than an actual demo. But they definitely should do the demo for everyone after LAD 8 release.


I didn’t even know Gaiden was out. Man, I've been a little out of touch with recent games, haven’t I?


i think it's nice but the pricing over here in my country is a bit exaggerated. game prices are going up all the time so having to buy gaiden to have a taste of 8 is not so cool :(


I like it. I like unlockables and I assume this isn’t difficulty set


This reminds me of mgs2 having a zone of the enders demo disc. Made me buy zoe


I think it’s great to add it to the game as an extra but it should also be separate. I’m a huge demo player and I can’t tell you how many times I have not been interested in a game but because there is a demo I have tried it. I spend a ton of money because of good demos. Having this at the end of Gaiden is awesome marketing but not having a robust demo that is separate (not a limited time demo either) will keep more people from seeing and and taking a chance on a great series imo.


I believe it's a fantastic feature that has been long gone. I've tried and learned about so many games that way.


Rgg studio : BIG BRAIN TIME


Totally innovative and will defo make us even more eager to play!


I think it’s perfect for fans of the series like me who’ve played thru all of Kiryu’s games but just couldn’t get past the turn-based fighting & massive game of LaD. Hopefully it convinces me to nut up and finally finish it, so I can be ready for IW


I think this is a special case, seeing how tightly connected these two games are (Kiryu lmao). I don't see this as a precedent for future titles.


Well its a special trial version, i guess lad 8 will have a normal demo too, but the gaiden one will have extra things.


it sucks for those who arnt interest in gaiden and only care about 8 which might only be a few but im sure they exist. RPG fans who got into 7 but dont like action games. it should at the very least also be something like a bonus for those who buy 8 be it pre order, special edition or just free.


personally idc because i buy gaiden anyways and im super hyped for 8 so i would be able to play the demo no matter how they do it


I think it’s a pretty awesome idea.


In continuing to make homage to JRPGs, they've taken up the Square Enix tactic of "Put a demo disc for a hype new game in with a game that has potential but just needs the boost." 

It's why the DQ that most Americans were familiar with for years was 8: it came with a Demo for FFX.


That’s great, games used to do this often if not providing a demo but providing a sneak peek of what’s coming next as a reward for beating the game. Great way to drum up interest in your game and actually make people play the game if they want exclusive content as opposed to watching it be played like kids do these days way too often


TBH I'm 99% sure that some kind of demo (if not the exact same one) will be released a little bit later on separately. They're doing this to persuade Gaiden players to get Infinite Wealth, but also to persuade IW players to get Gaiden. Once the window has closed, they'll make an IW demo to drag in everyone else.

I'm more troubled by what the demo-only bonus scenes and cut content is... I kind of don't want to play the demo in case it detects from the experience of playing the full game, but I also don't want to miss out on stuff that only in the demo and not the finished thing. 😜


I feel like the demo being available is


Hopefully I'll be caught up by the time it comes out. Still working on five, taking a break at the moment. Haven't touched six yet.


I love it, plus they said theres unique scenes and shit so its not just a demo its a lead-in from the ending of gaiden into 8. I really think its rad. People complaining about this are dumb.


Really cool, wish there more rewards for completing games, like Avatars or themes.


It’s a good incentive to buy Gaiden, but I’m interested in both games regardless.

I’d still prefer to buy Gaiden physically, so the fact that they did this made wonder…is there a chance Gaiden and Infinite Wealth get bundled together in a super deluxe version with steelbook?

Given that I’m behind on my Yakuza, I’m in no rush to buy a digi only version of a game.


I think its fine as long as the demo is not just a part of the game taken and modified a little bit to not spoil stuff. I liked the Special Demos of Pokemon ORAS and SM cus it was original stuff that introduced you to the game and its gameplay along with giving an interesting story segment bit that wasn't in the final game. Plus you got a special reward at the end to use in the final game like a mega stone or a pokemon with a unique form. Hopefully LAD Gaiden something like that


They should do this more for spinoff games in general. It would not only give people an excuse to potentially try out a new game but also play a demo for an upcoming game they're looking forward to.


Great because I’ll get a feel if I want to actually buy it or not. I don’t like turn based gameplay


I like it. Makes people have to experience Gaiden which is looking to be a great game first and in chronological order. Besides, the LAD8 demo has scenes that aren't even in the final version.


"Special trial version" reads to me more that it's an early access demo than a "full" demo.

This is nice, too


I'm surprised they have a working demo


Wait what there is demo out now?


Super smart


I think it would be cool if the trial version had you play through a Kiryu section but then they released a standalone demo where you play as Ichiban. Give us a feel for their two sides of the narrative


I have a theory that in LAD 8 it’ll be kinda split up like Yakuza 0 with Ichiban chapters and Kiryu chapters. I think only the Ichi chapters will be turn based and the Kiryu ones will be like Gaiden/Lost Judgment


Just hope for those of us who are planning on importing physical copies, this ain't gonna be a headache for us to download it. Since I believe downloadable content isn't cross region compatible on PSN.


it's something that was being done before as easter eggs/secrets in old games before demo discs were a thing and it's a nice thing imo


Good because I really wanna see the improvements they've made for the turn based combat


I think it's a pretty cool tactic. Also this isn't even the first time they've done this. Kiwami 1 included a 6 demo back when it came out originally in Japan.


Tbf, LAD itself did that for me, played that and ended up playing 0-6, J and LJ lol


In addition to it, it's going to be a good way to meet it halfway for fans of Kiryu to get used to it being an RPG for the next game; a big problem on the other side [More Yakuza/LAD fans were fine with the changeover, but this will take those last few holdouts who loved the beat-em-up into the mix.)


Wah


Idk, the whole point of a demo is for people to check if they are gonna like a game or not. Going "you want to see if you are gonna like this upcoming turn based RPG games? Play 30 hours of this beat em up with a different cast and unrelated story, and then at the end you can try this demo for the low low price of $70!" is an odd strategy to say the least.


This might be the most unique way to give demos in an era where game demos are few.


So like the mafia 2 demo from back in the day?


Bingo. For all intents and purposes this is basically 'More Game'.


I agree with this the most, I hope they make demos available later on, but the early access for more hardcore fans that buy all games is a great touch.


Well from what i have heard they did this with Kiwami where you got an exclusive demo of 6. But that demo never got released separately.


Also regarding pc players, demo is useful to find out how game performes at your pc.


> The motion blur... it hurt...

oh jesus christ... i bought the game because type 0 was this edgy FF game that never made it to the west and i wanted to play it so badly for years. was super exited.

i legit sold the game after a day because of the blur. i dont really get motion sick and even i felt uncomftable playing that shit


yeah, for example Burnout 3 demo included in NFS UG2 (PS2 version), i have more reason to boot up NFS only to play Burnout 3 lol


scummy if you charged this "special trial" separately, this is a nice bonus for Gaiden owners and incentives players who are on edge on buying Gaiden imo

Or scummy as in, "Gaiden should cost $30 but with this addition, $50 suddenly becomes justified"?


well, ishin was a remaster of a 9-year-old game.


![gif](giphy|l0MYK5GWLxrZ6AUWQ)

\>bloat

It's gonna be most definitely an optional download. It is definitely not bloat, Karkat.


When Gaiden releases, you will be able to play the trial after you finish Gaiden's story.  Think of it like the Majima Saga in Kiwami 2.


you need to complete Gaiden first to unlock it :p


now that you said it, i wonder if LAD 8 is released, will SEGA patch out this demo from Gaiden? Imagine the backlash if they did since i bet the demo is included in-game, like PS2 days.

"MUh CoNtEnT ReMOvEd" inb4


Gaiden's not out lol, you're not *completely* out of touch just yet!


I rented ZOTE after playing the demo. Which is good, because I completed it in like 5 hours flat.


You haven’t played judgment either?


they already confirmed that both will be turn based, how many times this copium is posted already? lol


Wahhh


What happened with the mafia 2 demo?


Just so the people who buy the game don't get flipped off mabye waiting with releasing the demo to the rest until the last couple of weeks before the game drops.. So people who don't play on day one have a chance to get to it


Not always though. Sometimes it's an older build that could run better or worse than the final release build.


Yeah... it's a great example of "game with interesting concept but botched the execution."


Scummy as in "Don't gatekeep demos on your game, release them fro free because it's a demo and we aren't on PS2 anymore"


Indeed. But can’t say there wasn’t some hype of its release. I jus feel that the numbers doesn’t equate the hype surrounding its release.


Damn, I'm turning into Y6 Kiryu. 😔


Not yet! Got a little burnt out on 3rd person action games in general after playing Y3/4/5, Elden Ring, TOTK in a year. Will definitely get to Judgement and LJ next vacation, probably Christmas.


If I'm interpreting what he's saying correctly, (and also remembering correctly, ngl) the Mafia II demo had one of the missions in it play out entirely different, with the same lead-up. Not to mention, you could go wherever in the city, so long as you did it under the 10 minute time limit. I remember it being summertime in the demo, while the mission in the full game is mid-winter. Granted, not TOO much difference, but I feel like there's more I'm forgetting.


How's the story?


you may be right, but i think this is one-off occasion since both games are released so close in between. As long as this demo is unique to Gaiden, i kinda liked it tbh


there was a ton of hype in the west, that's for sure, but i think japanese players weren't as keen on it. they'd already played the game when it came out, so i can imagine sales there weren't so good


Yeah also pretty sure the demo misson was in the 50s time skip while the full game misson was in 1945.


It’s kind of a product of it’s time, being made to be in a similar universe to FF13. There’s a lot of stuff I feel could have been better expanded on, but there was a teaser for something called Type Next which I assumed would go deeper into the lord, but… after all these years I think that’s vapourware. A shame, the teaser was neat.


This.

When they first started Remaking Ishin!, Yokoyama and SEGA said that they weren't even planning on releasing it in Japan.


Yep, especially since you're in Vito's house in the suburbs.


Also apart from the new engine  and new character starrings it almost is closer to a remaster than remake since it's that 1 to 1. Apart from a translation the game wasn't in real need of a remake aswell imo.


One of them is max 20 mins and the other max 20-30 mins


ive played hawai today. i stoped playing after a time. as far as i can tell, you get a pretty big chunk of hawai to explore at your own leisure. you can beat up goons. they respawn. there are atleast 3 substories and 3 minigames (one is karaoke). you have 4 people in your party with 4 skills each, 3 poundmates and 3 additonal jobs. you can swap the jobs freely. the 4 people you play have all their own jobs with one special move. furthermore you have point of interests with your group, where you can chat.

think of it as a free roam mode with some featues missing.. its super fun and i cant wait to play the game. i dont know if there is a timelimit though. the somewhat half hour i played had no warning or something, which would indicate a time limit. i guess the story demo is just done after a time. there are a few textmessages at some shops which say: find out in the real game.


There’s two types of demos, Story and Hawaii. Story I believe is like 15-20 minutes long but I have not played Hawaii yet


The mugging for the camera is unnecessary and I wish all these folks would keep their kids off their shows.


Oh man. I love Jen.


I know this is 90% of HGTV lately. But what bothers me most is that she’s not a designer or renovator at all. I followed her on instagram for years (because I liked her kitchen) and that’s just not what she did. She was an influencer. I think she even admitted somewhere that HGTV said “all you have to do is show up and we’ll handle the rest” creating the show and persona for her. 

I get that it’s TV and there’s going to be some made up stuff to create interest. But knowing they put out stuff like this, where it’s 100% made up really turns me off and is why I’m starting to watch a lot less.


My complaint about Jen is the same as my complaint about most of the other HGTV shows - I intensely dislike how these people use their kids as part of the "lifestyle brand" especially since the kid(s) can't consent to being on TV. 

Also - their kids (and spouses) are usually not good actors so those fake scenarios that the producers cook up just make the kid(s) and spouse look like idiots.  (I feel so sorry for Taylor El Moussa because she's probably a normal kid but she comes off so bratty on camera).


I don’t mind Jen, but cannot handle the twins on unsellable houses. At all.


There’s only a few hosts that I’m not really interested in watching. Mostly because they are given too much air time. 

Focus on the property, not the personality, or personal life! HGTV seems to be catering to people in the audience who care about influencer status, or the show stars who are trying to become the next Martha with an empire of products and income streams. 

I don’t mind the twins, they are a bit much though. I like the concept of the program. Something doesn’t seem natural about their onscreen behavior, like it’s an over the top performance or something. 

Jen seems quirky and quite animated, but I think her work is well-done. I enjoy seeing more moderate updating, versus sledgehammering everything in sight. I like that she repurposes or sells things instead of tossing it all in a dumpster. 

Even the prop bros are fine, but don’t need them on 17 versions of their shows. 

I never understood the popularity of the Waco couple. He was such a freaking obnoxious dork, and she was bland and dull. 

There’s one host with tons of arrogance that seems to keep getting featured. Hope that ends soon. Awful!


I actually love watching Jen. She's full of energy, but isn't overly annoying. I love her designs as well.


I enjoy her and this show


I like "No Demo Reno", but I see why you wouldn't. Jen definitely leans hard into the "Look how weird and goofy I am!" shtick. And 100% agree on "Unsellable Houses" - they just yell, all the time, and I can't deal with it.

HGTV has gone hard for shows featuring "influencer" type designers.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes you get total train-wrecks like "Home in a Heartbeat".


Oh my gosh, we are the opposite in our house! We love Jenn and I can totally see myself being friends with her. Granted, I'm the quiet one in my friend group and have always loved being around big personalities. It's also refreshing to see her update houses to make them more functional/beautiful for families, instead of the usual "we've outgrown the space" go-to.


Totally agree. We need Refinement and classiness…Sarah Richardson and Tommy!


Her personality is VERY big, but I generally like the Renos she does.  She seems pretty good at tweaking for beauty and function.  
I feel like the result is pretty “aspirational” - like i feel like they are DO-able


Really like unsellable houses.  It's original. And it's on a cool area you don't see a lot on other shows.


Jen has so much hair it freaks me out, like I can't imagine how much of it is laying around her house.


I watched a few episodes because I was bored but then I couldn't understand what the hell I was supposed to get from the show. She is unprofessional and her husband was an overgrown, bratty man child. Give me Hilary Farr, Vern Yip, or Candace Olsen (I used to LOVE her shows when I was in high school!) any day. They are actual designers with the schooling and clients to back up their work not some hack from social media like TV networks seem to think people what to see. Hilary can be a little abrasive but she's honest, dedicated, and sharp.


love her. one of the very few authentic hosts on hgtv these days.


Yeah, I could do with less of her husband and children only because they don't add value to the show and her children come off as spoiled but I think Jen is a breath of fresh air. She's a natural on camera so her vibrancy comes across as genuine. She dispenses digestible tips that anyone can use and I've liked every reno she and her team have done.


Sorry, I don't agree. I've been following Jen since she started on Instagram. She is a joy to watch. So real.


I watched a part of one No Demo Reno episode and had to turn it off.  Her "former cheerleader" persona and all of the time spent on her family is not interesting to me.


I used to love her show but she's just getting to be too much for me


What's funny about Chip is that when you go back to the first season of Fixer Upper, he acted... normal? None of the goofy stunts or annoying behavior.


I just watched the episode and it was great. is she energetic yes, but I don’t think it’s over the top at all, it’s just her personality and I enjoy watching her. She is so much better than hosts on some shows that are extremely boring. the family stuff didn’t bother me either, it was such a small portion of the episode. Her design was also really nice and I enjoy that she seems to have a lot of variety in what she does and really focuses on what works for her client.


If you watch her show you can play and drink every time she says you just need to  "zhuzh up" a space. Or do like I do, and watch along until she says it the first time and then stop watching.

I try to tell myself to be less of a grouch but it gets on my nerves a bit


She’s better than the trailer park show going on in Indianapolis.


I like the idea of no sledgehammers. Hate to see good cabinets and appliances smashed up for no reason.


I never liked Chip either but Jen is okay with me. Chip always came across as a man child to me. Just constantly goofy for no good reason. I like the premise of No Demo Reno and I enjoy Jen’s designs, so I watch the show.


I honestly don't mind either Jen or the Twins, but I can do without the "family" stuff and the kids being on camera. 

Same with Chip / Joanna, Christine, Tarek, all of them.  I could not care less about their family life and kids / significant others.  And the last thing I want to see is one of them going to the dr for an ultrasound. 

Show us the renovation. Period.


Every. Single. Episode. There is DEMO. I’d be embarrassed if I were HGTV.


I adore the twins, and I like Jen well enough. Different strokes for different folks…


Chip G rocks!


I must be easy to please. I like all the hosts on HGTVs shows. I don’t find any of them annoying


The brunette on unsellable houses. Omg! I can't watch. She's definitely adhd or something, the weird noises and loudness of her voice. I can't.


I really like her and her personality, but when i watched the episode last night, it’s non stop “goofy” ( for a lack of better words) behavior. It is literally every single scene now, which I don’t think is reading the way she wanted it too. It just feels like someone who has no idea what they’re doing making jokes about how they don’t know what they’re doing. I’m bummed because the first few seasons were way better. It’s just too much now and distracts from the show.


If I ignore their personalities and focus on their way of working with the houses (and noting anything that is relevant to my home reno situation), then I can binge watch a few episodes of their shows without tuning out. That doesn’t sound great, does it?
Love your work, quite dislike your tv personality and presence 😬


Yes


Not a fan either. I stick to Farmhouse Fixer these days and that about it. I love old houses


yes


FAST FORWARDING ANY Design show with clips on the host’s personal life!!
I tune in to watch her design not her personal life, which I have zero interest in, and don’t appreciate having it forced on us (or the poor carpenters who have to go to her house and deal with the craziness for the initial job meeting). 🤦🏻‍♀️


What episode and season did Jenn drink a bottle of water quickly?


Me too!  She’s got the energy of a puppy.  I love her joy (such a contrast to Hilary’s “I’m a little short on the sugar” frown).   I like that she sells unneeded items to stretch the budget.


I love her too.  If you follow her on Instagram she's always who she is.


I love her too. 

She's fun and creative and nothing like Chip Gaines


I think these people without some formal education in design are an insult to those who put the time into actually learning the craft.  But it seems to be all about looks, bubbly personalities, and the illusion that this is how designers live and work.  Total BS.  I am not even in the business of design, but I feel it is painfully obvious to most it is not actual talent that gets one a show.  Same with fashion designer shows, imo.


I don't like *them* per say, but I love what they do for the houses.

 I just skip over all of the annoying twin things/family things


Agreed!!


Joanna is as interesting as watching paint dry. That farmhouse chic look is so dated and poorly done. And it wouldn't hurt to see some colors other than 50 shades of beige (I'm looking at you, Amber Lewis and Studio McGee) and white.


Or the Indiana group. The most recent episode had one of them screeching at another as they ignored instruction to not touch some trim or something. And I don’t want these “let’s look back on…” filler shows.


>I never understood the popularity of the Waco couple. He was such a freaking obnoxious dork, and she was bland and dull.

I don't mind these two so much, but the real entertainment on that show are the father and son who work for them. The son seems to have stopped appearing, which is a shame. They are both quite funny and should be featured more.


Yeah Home in a Heartbeat was unwatchable! I like Jen though. She's so hyper and it can take a minute to get used to but her designs are great and I love the idea of working in the existing floorplan. The twins? Just so LOUD.


Home in a heartbeat produces undeniably beautiful results. I’m honestly confused why you would call this a train wreck?


I so miss Sarah and Tommy!


Loved watching Sarah, Candice, Vern, and Tommy. Even Sabrina Soto's look for less design show was fun back in the late 2000s.


Sarah and Tommy did great, beautiful spaces.  Her colors and styling were almost always right up my alley!  But I would never dream of hiring her unless I had half a million dollars to drop in the job.  Everything she did always seemed to end up costing a fortune.


Miss them!


I like her renovations and I also appreciate that she salvages as much as she can and even sells items. It’s just the constant dancing around, crossing her eyes, and overall mugging for the cameras.


I had no idea she was a former cheerleader, but that makes sense with all of the dancing and jumping up and down.


It's the same thing that happened on Top Gear with the original presenters. The first few episodes was them finding their way, then they figured out a formula the audience liked, then as they settled into their "roles" they started playing it up a bit. Then, the playing up got more pronounced over time, and it was good and funny for a while, but then after a long while they started going too far with it, and it moved up through ridiculous to inauthentic, obviously put-on and it stopped being funny. 

I found Chip amusing in the middle for a few seasons, but at the end it drifted firmly into annoying. As for Joanna, with Chip as the comedian in the show too she had no choice but to play the "straight man" role. However, after a while she did come off as largely humourless, and started taking herself that bit too seriously. 

I liked most of the remodels they did (apart from all the broken down old wrecked stuff they dragged in, calling it "antique", which I have commented separately about) but the criticism on her about her being a one-note designer is absolutely true.


Good way of putting it. Those people are off putting.


Can *NOT* stand the Indianoplace group! Unbearable!


Agree!


I’m in the minority but I kind of like Chip too. He’s goofy but seems to know his stuff. Different than most HGTV hosts.


Chip G does not, by any stretch of the imagination, rock.


No, I think most are fine too, there is a lot of hate in this sub Reddit. I really only dislike the El Moussas on that couples show. And the home in a heartbeat and teen mom people aren’t great but could be worse.


Hilary is just British. I love her no nonsense, straight-to-the point attitude. Americans dance around the truth too much.


Same. But she also annoys me. I️ think if the show was just her and the clients it would be so much better. Just like with the Unsellable Houses twins-I️ don’t need to see your kids and your “home stress” trying to do it all 🙄 
Then again maybe I’m just a jealous old hag because I️ lived all that and wasn’t smart enough to turn into a business on social media 😂


But…if you follow her on Instagram you also know she’s not a “renovation expert” and this is all fake. Which makes me bummed.


Agreed! I’d love to see more shows of people with some formal education in design too, but I would even be ok with people who had no formal education, but actually did it on a day to day basis and learned their way. HGTV’s been literally taking influencers that did nothing but product promotion and hired others to renovate their own homes, then try to pass them off as “design experts”…it’s crazy. 

I read the article when she first got her show where she said HGTV told her just show up for filming and they would handle everything else, from hiring contractors, design, etc. She got famous on Instagram for mommy/lifestyle blogging and writing a book about wine, but never anything to do with renovating or design.


Except they overdo the staging accessoerization. I really don’t need a tray with two wine glasses, some cheese and fruit on it to get a space!


Who is the father/son — on what show


And Candice. And Vern. Sigh…


But isn’t that half the fun of these shows? To see those gorgeous spaces that we can try to emulate for less. When HGTV sold they have quietly removed almost all the professionals and turned it into Bravo.


You certainly don't.


Hillary is the best! I love watching her give it to namby pamby Americans who decide after drawings and approvals they want a powder room where there wasn’t one—or some such. If I had the money, it would go to Hillary, who knows what someone wants before they can conjure the words,


🙌 — and I’m American, not a drip of Brit. I wish we didn’t dance around the truth so much.


Hillary hasn't been "British" for years.  She has an office and business in Philly and works there, and in Canada.


I'm inclined to agree, but apparently it works, assuming the numbers they cite at the end of the episodes are true.


Yes, that definitely made Sarah fun to watch!  *Yeah, if I was a billionaire like Sarah and her husband, I’d certainly do that*…

I do miss the real designers who were renovating existing space for homeowners rather than concentrating on flipping (although I enjoy those, too, TBH).  Love Jasmine Roth, although her niche of small SoCal ranch-style tract homes is somewhat limited for inspiration.

It seems to me that the pendulum is swinging back somewhat from the focus on flipping/ complete gut jobs to focusing a bit more on smaller problem spaces ina house.


The problem with Hillary is she promises everything, and then there’s always some drama about why she cannot give them what they need and needs more money out of the budget.


The problem with Hillary’s on-screen “clients” is they are lay people who say they want A-B-C-D and E, then decide they want something additional or different once they react to elevation, layout and mechanicals drawings. 

She doesn’t promise “everything;” like any architect—interior or otherwise—they rely on what clients tell them initially. These people also have unrealistic ideas about what comprises a scope change. They think “while you’re in there” provides room for all sorts of changes that can be included in the original price; and they’re wrong. Re-drawing alone costs time and money. 

And in what world does a client who says “I can only spend $X” get “everything” they want. The point is they’re working with a professional who then prices out labor and materials and is obligated to inform the client what’s realistic—especially since they can’t magically know there are slow leaks in walls, a failing subfloor, termites or other surprises once demolition starts.

You’ve obviously never worked with an architect.


What is with the needless looks-based judgement on this sub?


I think her hair is beautiful! I know A LOT of women that wish their's would grow that long.

It's weird to me that women pay a ton of money on extensions (not a thing wrong with that) & no one criticizes.... but everyone thinks a woman should cut naturally long hair. Just something I've observed quite a bit....not necessarily directed at this post.

I think her makeup is fine, too. I'm no expert, tho. I do think the cover shots they've used have often been edited horribly.


I like her. She's fun. She Does good work.


There’s nothing wrong with Jenn, she’s young and beautiful and quirky yes but she knows her sh**.


I like Jen and I think her red hair is gorgeous. I also like her designs. I also like the “no demo” part of the show because I think a no demo reno would be more accessible to many homeowners than the “total gut job, pull permits to change stuff” renos we see on the other Hgtv shows.


She is trolling you with her intro tonight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣


I am so tired of people bashing the hosts over their hair, clothes, etc. She is a good designer, she is enjoyable to watch and I like the show. The appearance of someone is not a reason to dislike them.


I will take her any day over the fakes like Heather El Mousa.


This post ain’t it. Love Jenn - she’s true to herself & stunning


I adore her!  If I had that beautiful red hair, I would NEVER cut it….never even noticed any outlandish make-up. Maybe you need to adjust the color on your tv.


i cannot even imagine caring so much about someone else’s makeup that i make a conscious effort to go online and complain about it lmao.


I always think that posters who criticize others looks should post their own picture so that we can critique their looks.


I like her, she has a good sense of humor.


She is one of my favorites!  She’s fun and I love how if she goofs/errs she just goes with it or makes fun of herself or makes a funny face.


Rude. Don't watch the show then JFC.


I enjoy that she doesn’t seem to take herself too seriously. She seems like she would be fun and laid back to hang out with.


I love her and the show. She’s fun, totally someone I would be real friends with.


If your attitude in person is as blatantly awful as it appears online, then people in your life will never notice how you cut your hair or do your makeup. OP? I want to like you (ha!), but you need a hubris cut and someone to calm you down about 5 pegs. Very distracting. Perhaps OP should blend her personality better with traits such as kindness, perspective, and empathy before she has opinions about warm and cool colors in other people’s makeup. Or whatever. You get the point.


I love her red hair, but I dont like her stupid bun when she wears it like that but that’s her choice. I also really hate her style. Farmhouse white grey boring. As someone from the same area she designs in…I’m over it.


I enjoy her personality


Tool


I watch her show on mute with subtitles 🤣


Eh, her hair and makeup aren’t my style, but as long as she likes it that’s all that matters.


Every. Single. Episode. There is DEMO. I’d be embarrassed if I were HGTV.


Beats me. I find her quite attractive and I might be alone here but I find her quirkiness entertaining.


people who make those kinds of criticisms should be required to post a picture of themselves.


It’s distracting, and not intrinsic to her personhood.


Love her hair 😍


But is she physically attractive? /s


The only part that bugs me is, sometimes I’ve seen them do things like take out entire walls…which IS demo. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m not sure if they’ve done it as much lately, but the first season they did it quite a bit.


🤣 best glam squad ever!


Pretty sure it was lifted from her insta, so HGTV saving some money.


Again, she was talking about her glam squad on the show. Therefore it’s part of the show.


Not criticizing her physical self, criticizing poor makeup application. There is a difference. 
I’m actually not too bad looking but I don’t lather on clashing foundation and would have a make up artist focus on my looking natural rather than “Done”.  Again, she brought up her glam team as part of the new episode last night.


Have you been watching this season?  Because "farmhouse white gray boring" is not her style at all.  She's been open about how the homeowners in the first season were unwilling to use color.


It's judging a person based on their appearance. Which is generally a shitty thing to do.


Yes she’s physically attractive, But is she hot?! Lol I hope your comment is a The Office reference.


Who cares.


Her glam squad slaps! 😆


Still doesn’t mean you bash her appearance


Yeah I think fans forget these designers don't really do their own personal style in other people's homes.  They do to a degree,  but it's really about what the owner wants. That said--- I've not seen her do much "farmhouse" at all. Even if you use shiplap in a house,  that doesn't necessarily make it farmhouse.  

I wonder how many people critical of designers using so many neutrals actually use a lot of color in their own homes? In my experience, the overwhelming majority of people play it safe and are seemingly terrified they'll want to repaint a wall in 10 years. I'm not one of those people--I have a lot of color in my house. I can't tell how many people that come to my house say,  "I love your house...I love all of this color! I'd be too scared to do it at my house,  but I love it!"  

I obviously don't understand the fear of color, but I'm fully aware it's the reality. When we did a flip house...I did it in grays and whites. 🤷🏼‍♀️


You know I haven’t, I’m not there yet. I’ve been playing episodes as I work but I’m glad to hear the newest season is different


She just opened tonight’s show talking about her hair and makeup. 🤦‍♀️ But it’s not okay to have an opinion?


I’m judging her foundation choice, not her quality as a person. She hosts a show that is based on improving appearance of homes. 
She should be blending her foundation better before she has a lot of opinions about warm and cool paint chips.


I think her makeup is not blended. Horrors!


It's ok to have an opinion, but you don't have to share them when they are shitty.

If you don't have anything nice to say...


You are right, but you’re wasting your time arguing with this jackass. There’s no hope for this person.


Really? So it’s okay for you to have an opinion about a makeup foundation comment but not okay for me to comment on something the host has mentioned. It wasn’t shitty, she was talking about her mua on the show. Fair game to comment on what is talked about by the host on the show. Perhaps you’re leaning into this because of something in your life. Odd.


hawaii demo is part of the story with a boss and three substories which I'm sure will be in the main game


If I had to guess it's probably based off of how the story demo starts.  The first five minutes of it has content that I doubt will be in the final game, just based off of how the same scene plays out in the trailers.  >!I feel like we will see the scene where Ichiban and Kiryu meet from Ichiban's perspective in the final game, rather than Kiryu's perspective that we see in the demo.!<


Thanks a lot for the precision! And i assume the story demo is the beginning of the game? 

Guess i'll just wait the full game then!


i see, i guess i can easily skip it then, and at worst i'll watch a youtube video of it after i finished the first chapters of 8

thanks


there are a lot of details missing, you're thrown into action without context, it's most likely chapter 2/3


It isn't even important enough to look up at that point.  It feels more like a way to loosely connect Gaiden to the demo, instead of just dropping you into the story demo at a random point.  So don't worry, you won't be missing out on anything.


It’s awful. I’ve followed her on IG for a few years and she has ZERO real design experience, education, etc. She is a momstagrammer/mommy blogger who used to show shelf styling with trinkets from Wayfair on her instastories. She’s never had a design business, designed homes for others, ANYTHING.

She’s a huge fraud and it honestly makes me sour on HGTV that they would say she’s any kind of expert.

Oh and last week there were a bunch of homeowners from this show posting on FB that their homes were ruined by this show and she wouldn’t help them get it fixed. 

Awful!


Yeah, I don't think they understand what 'no demo' means, and I find the host kind of shrill (and wish she would tie her hair up while construction was happening), but I like the *idea* of the show, and there are shriller hosts, so I'll probably watch them :p


We tried a few eps and gave up. We figured it'd be a fancier trading spaces type show but were disappointed.

And there's definitely demo involved which defeats the purpose of the title.


Ugh. I just looked up her blog. “I wear the same sweats 3 days in a row. *Unique.* “My three kids are loud, but I love them.” *Kookie.* “I have thyroid disease.” *Crazy.* “My husband is 12 years older than me.” *Wacky.*


On the first episode, she carried a toddler into the room to ask her (the toddler) which flooring to pick out. UGH!  Later her somewhat older son was forced to sit in on a meeting with some adults to discuss design choices.  At the end she asked her son if she had made the right choice.  He said "Yeah, can I have my game back now?"  He was NOT happy.  She is an idiot, IMO.


I honestly thought that it was some pilot from about 2006 that HGTV showed a few times and then shelved because it didn’t get great reviews.


There is definitely some demo, so the name isn't perfect

Not a huge fan of it, reminds me of 5 min craft type of execution


I like the concept but a lot of the stuff getting fixed seems like it would require demo...

Also, idk it felt kind of rushed. Like one minute they're fixing stuff and the next minute they were staging?


I’m kinda digging it. And the construction guy poured into those jeans! I find myself wondering if his pants are Lycra stretch.


Um. I think using a sledge hammer is reno. Call me stupid but... not a great title.  Nice decorating but I don't know,  just more of the same as every other show so it's a no go.


Anytime you gut a kitchen or bath, that's called demo.  This show is a fraud.


Well, apparently her husband Mike Todyrk has wanted to be on TV for a long time. His EX WIFE also named Jennifer and him were on Sexual Healing Season 1 Episode 4. Halfway through he is "getting serviced " by his wife in bed. It's in amazon prime.  My jaw is still on the floor.  He talks about being a Christian yet puts that out there.  I am still shocked at ALL this.  I stopped watching after that light porn scene.  Eeewwwww.


I thought she was a little too loud and bubbly. Normally good traits but obnoxious in this case. The demo'd reno looked pretty generic and probably could have been thought up by most homeowners.


The “No Demo” part of the title is a gimmick that they couldn’t even carry through one episode. It seems like HGTV want this to have another interesting family side plot, but it really just plays as filler because it’s just a home decorating show. We started watching the second show tonight and couldn’t finish the first ten minutes. That kitchen should have been a gut job and they demolished a wall and ripped up a floor while pretending it wasn’t “demo”. 

This show won’t last long.


I've watched three episodes now and am a little disappointed that her color palette is basically bright white, white, and grey. I have a white tile floor in my kitchen and I curse it every day -- every single piece of dust shows UP. I can't imagine how bad it gets when everything is white.


I'm not sure I've seen a new episode but I liked it enough.  I have seen the same episode twice now. One of them I watched the was also demo so not sure about the title ...


She said on the last episode that she normally wouldn’t do that much demolition but because it was her best friend, she would make an exception which I found to be unfair given that it basically went against the premise of the show. Also, I follow her on IG, the show has turned me off from her. The way she interacts with people seems snippy at times, Idk, she isn’t how she portrays her self on her IG.


So I just watched No Demo Reno they need to change the title on the show there is a lot of Demo on this show. The host Jenn has no design sense. The kids lost a flex room and she put a secret hideaway for them sure 3 kids are going to be able to fit. Ugh I’m not liking this show at all.


The show is bad.  Who puts a dishwasher next to a stove away from the sink? Now you have to carry dirty dishes across the room to load it? The only focus on this was"how gorgeous is that backsplash?" Was that to get your eyes off of the bad design with the misplaced dishwasher?This girl does not know what she is doing. Has no design sense at all. Also the title of the show is not correct. Alot of dancing around with no professionalism swinging her hair doesn't cut it has a good designer. Not a fan. I hope hgtv does not have a lot of money invested in this show. It needs to go or put in on in the middle of the night. Go continue being a mommy blogger and hang up your hammer if you know what that is. You have no experience in this field and it shows. Yuck not watching again. Had enough!


I just watched the latest episode. I've read that a lot of these shows do shoddy work, but this time I actually saw it in the ep. 

Check out the grout and paint job in this kitchen. It's embarrassingly bad. 

https://imgur.com/a/pgMrbfs


Never heard of it.  I'll check it out.

Thanks.


Ok. I’m watching it right now and I had to immediately go onto Reddit and see if there was  a chat about this. I love the concept of the show and I want to watch it BUT I FUCKING HATE HER. She’s so LPBW Audrey, and that doesn’t help, But even without the Audge comparison, everything about her is cringe. You can see that her contractors and even her husband hates her. Why am I 42 minutes into that s show? I think I hate myself now!


I just watched the second episode and saw the tile job in the bathroom and I would’ve made them redo it or fire them. The lines are all over the place and why use dark grey grout in a bathroom to what show off the uneven tile job??? I could’ve done a better job with my eyes closed. How did she get an HGTV show?


So wasn’t feeling well while working remotely so watched 4 episodes and finally had to stop even while multitasking. I felt like it was white person save Christian show in addition to questionable taste and accurate pricing she only has safe white clients no people of color, gay or transgender. HGTV is better than this!


I think Jennifer is a wonderful fresh of breath air!  She has wonderful ideas and really does change the whole feel of the space.  She has a FUN and sparkly personality and her end projects looks wonderful. She she should be quite proud of herself and others who have negative-nelly things to say...just keep walking on by.  We know people by how strong and strange their words and how they negatively feel the need the trash people they don't even know.  We're talking about bathroom tile here folks, not mid-east peace talks.  THUMBS UP for No Demo Reno!!!


Ohh gosh..... The Modernized MCM home... that is depressing. she just ruined the house. It has NOTHING to do with MCM. I would be pissed if that was in my house.


It's White And/Or Monochrome Kitchen Basic Bitch, The Show


Season 1, Episode 10. I like some of what they did but I hate those countertops that they not only used in the kitchen but the bathroom. You know the ones - they’re in every big box home store - mostly white with occasional giant irregular stripes. Nothing designer or special about those AND they’re ugly. I do like the walls with the black cabinets, the lights, the tub and shower redo. The designer is a little annoying but she has great energy anyway!


>Oh and last week there were a bunch of homeowners from this show posting on FB that their homes were ruined by this show and she wouldn’t help them get it fixed

Not surprised considering a lot of the stuff they redid looked like it was structural damage that needed proper repair.


Dear god I went to her insta out of morbid curiosity. Is asking insipid questions of people to make them think you  are ‘ just like them’ as a cover for spraying your affluence in their face like a firehose a thing on Instagram? /s.  I’ll answer my own question - that IS Instagram.


I’m not surprised by this. An episode I️ watched yesterday, a farmhouse theme, they took away the wall in the family room where a large tv was and put a built in that looked like where a smaller tv would go. My husband would be pissed. They also took away the tub in the master bath and put a large shower instead. I️ could be wrong, but I got the feeling the homeowners were shocked and unaware about some things that went on.


Sexual Healing season 1 episode 4 if you want to see Mike, her husband and his ex wife named Jennifer (didn't know he had one). Halfway through in bed getting serviced. I knew they were fake but I am flabbergasted.  I read it here by sometime else and thought it couldn't be real.  I stopped watching after the bed scene.  And he still claims he's a good Christian. Whatever buddy.  Soft porn. Seriously sick. Shocking.  Fake, fake and faker.


Would you mind sharing the FB link ??


It’s all grey, white and brick. They all look the same. I was disappointed.


I'm glad I wasn't the only one who could not stop looking at her hair. Yes it's pretty and looks feathery soft but having long hair wisp around like that seems impractical.


I know you wrote this a year ago and (if you even still follow this thread) will wonder why I’m commenting now but I just started watching the show and need to read some fellow viewers opinions bc WHY is it called ‘no demo’ when they take it down to the studs?!!! Also: Her hair reminds me of Pebbles Flintstone’s.


They’re obviously trying to monetize the whole family, kids included. Gross.


It still not getting good reviews.


That man is beautiful but I feel like that amount of muscle can only be from steroids.


Hopefully it will get canceled!


I was thinking that, too.  Also she put all the breakable decorative items on the shelves in that room, even the shelves on the secret kid door.  It did make sense.  It also seemed like the owner specifically said they needed a place for the baby to play, and a place to store big toys, when not in use.  The revealed finished rooms just had no toys at all.


Don't bother. You are wasting your time.

Good question.  So many more talented people out there with years of experience that would have made a much better show than this.


I think many of the comments (although maybe not worded in the nicest way) bring up legitimate concerns related to the authenticity of the show and the cast, in particular Jenn. She does not have a degree in home design and as a long term follower there have been seemingly drastic shifts in her personality. She is talented, for sure and this may be a part of the maturation process, however, she does name drop and presents her self as a highly acclaimed star. She refers to Chip and Joanna as "The Gaines" and speaks as if they know each other well (which I am quite sure they do not). On stories today she had a song playing stating "ain't no business, like show business". If she wants to be famous, that is perfectly fine! The issue is that she tries to portray that she is just a talented girl who kept getting offers and if all this ended tomorrow then no biggie. I don't think anyone buys that and its been shown and said that she was the one chasing fame. Little things like this make her seem very unauthentic and unrelatable.


And OMG she just used those countertops again in the pool house episode.


I remember someone posted this on her GOMI  thread and it got deleted and they shut down the thread for like a month. They definitely don’t want anyone seeing Mike, famewhore number two, on that show! It is literally insane and so hilarious that he is having sex on camera for the world to see. They’ve been at this fame thing for a while.


They were all beneath the preview video on the HGTV Facebook page last week, but then they started deleting the comments and then ultimately deleted the entire video and the whole thread.


I’m Just watching it for the first time, too, and came on Reddit to see why she doesn’t put the TVs back up in the rooms.  And I noticed what someone else said about putting the molding and sconces up above the fire place where the tv had been and the couple said they liked—The sconces looked too close together to fit the large TV.  And they didn’t put the TV back up.  Maybe she doesn’t like how they look in her designs so she creates a space for them, but the homeowners need to install them?

It seems like the premise of the show is to do fast paced renovations and not take down any load bearing walls?  They also keep the fixtures where the plumbing is already located.  I don’t mind how the transformations I have seen so far look on screen, but it’s unfortunate to hear that homeowners weren’t happy with the quality of work (as someone mentioned).  (I’m only a few episodes in, and watching on an iPad, so maybe it looks worse on a big TV?  I’m kind of watching it and shopping online at the same time, so not studying it closely. 

She has beautiful hair, but I agree that her half-up style makes her look like Pebbles.  Maybe that’s what she’s going for.  I like that she’s a little goofy and funny.


Ahahah, I think people have brought it up to her as I remember in a recent episode she threw some shade about how x thing she was doing "definitely counts as no demo"


There can be no doubt that those muscles are from  steroids if you know the characteristics to look for.


Definitely roids but boy did he look good.


Agreed.  From what I have seen, not interested..


Little People Big World, and Audrey is Jeremy’s wife. Look her up - she’s a dead ringer for the No Demo gal in looks AND in annoying self-righteousness. And yet….there I am watching…😔


Absolutely shocking!! I started following her at 70k followers.  Nice Christian home school part time family.  Wow. Just wow.  Not so much.  That was literally soft porn with his ex wife.  "That's a little too rough". Can't stop laughing.  It was worth the 1.99 to buy that episode.  Now when my husband and I see him we laugh out loud because we can't unsee him and the ex wife in bed.  Can you say scummy. Hope the fame is worth it to them.  Feel so bad for their kids.


Ha,damages controlled,eh?? Thanks,I always like those tidbits behind the scene.


I think she “thinks” she’s goofy & funny but it translates to me as obnoxious and overbearing. And yeah, the TV thing would NOT go over well with most people. I get it, electronics may not “go” with her designs, but it’s not 1942. Real people have and want TVs and she should work them into her designs. I liked the one she did where 2 friends shared a house and the downstairs resident got a great kitchen and the upstairs one got a great TV room. One of the few times where it looked like there were no bad surprises for her clients.


It’s definitely demo. She must not know what demo means! It’s probably that because she doesn’t seem too bright. Maybe the show should be called Partial Demo Reno…


oh, like what?


Lol.  These kinds of shows are still interesting to watch, I think, so I’m still watching, as well.  I looked up the Audrey thing and deleted the comment when I figured it out.  I generally don’t watch much TV, so I don’t know any of these people, haha.


I’ve been following her on IG for a while, and Mike had always weirded me out. Tried to like the show, but she just paints everything white.


I am also a longtime IG follower of hers. Not sure why I’ve stuck around so long but I am definitely souring on her (and Mike) now. 

Do you remember when they were going to have Von on the Ellen Show? How did I not realize they have been chasing fame this whole time!


I’m just reading the comments online and I didn’t realize she wasn’t a professional designer.  I had never heard of her before watching some episodes of the show yesterday.  It sounds like people really don’t like her?

Steroids preferentially increase the size of the muscles that attach to the shoulder joints: the lats, trapezius, pectorals, deltoids, and upper arms. (Interestingly, that’s also where steroid-induced acne is most likely to appear.)


Oh yeah, it’s still worth watching. I still get some ideas that are worthwhile.  And, if I didn’t have something to complain about or be judgey about, there’d be no reason to be on Reddit!


LOL. You aren't wrong!!!


OMG! No I apparently wasn't around for Von on Ellen or I missed it.  That is freaking crazy.  Why are they so hungry to be famous.  It's unreal.. I am still weirded out seeing Mike in bed with his ex wife while she's doing stuff to him and the camera is literally just on his face recording him. Who does that? Who wants kid and second wife on TV? Oh boy!!!


Haha.  I just saw the beginning of the episode where she is meeting her clients for the first time and she’s wearing jeans with a hole on the backside.  You can see her butt cheek.  It‘s the one where she does a pool house.

Rule 34 plz leave this be


This would be such an upgrade from her other skins omg.


horny


Kick da demo


Cute ghostie


I like it too, but I’m curious, what started it? I’m fairly new to this sub, so I don’t get a lot of the jokes and the whatnot, so I’m wondering who thought it was a good idea


If I had a dollar for every time my ghostface got shipped/sexualized, I’d be drowning in the dough. 😎


*sad ghostface main noises*


WHY DID YOU DELETE YOUR OTHER COMMENT PLEASE I LOVED IT SO MUCH


IT’S SO CUTE


Yes I am slightly scared of the fact I kinda found Amanda hot

Oh god am I becoming like the hornies..?

**Oh god wait she’s a fucking serial killer with a pig mask oh no oh no what have I done?!?**


Is that even a question?


I'm not okay with how much I'm okay with her outfit.

Her outfit in the pic isn’t even sexual/very revealing..


She looks cool 🤷🏻‍♂️


Go to the opposite of horny jail. At this point, you need some clarity and ease the bottled sexual frustration. Because calling that vulgar is, honestly, concerning.

There is another DbD sub to help you with that, you know....


Don't kick da demo

His article still sucks according to her.


I’m guessing it started because they both crouch


You mean:

*sigh*


Hey just because he has the lowest skill ceiling in the game, obnoxious amounts of bugs giving him kills he doesn't deserve making him incredibly frustrating to play against, and obnoxious cringe-inducing mains on the Reddit doesn't mean he's all bad.

His pallet stun sound is one of the best in the game and I just wish he had a power that was actually fun and skillful to use. When I play him I'm just incredibly bored because I'm not doing anything. I'm just getting free undeserved insta-downs with no skill cap or anti-loop abilities. There's nothing I can learn playing him. While playing somebody like Huntress Oni or nurse there's a new trick I learn every time I play them and it feels like a battle of skills and knowledge, while ghost face gameplay boils down to 

"im looking right at him! He's not even stealthy! It's the middle of a chase! Now I'm exposed.. fun hurrah..."


Didn't want to ruin an art post with drama.


But yeah normally I would agree with you. Thinking of pig having sex with ghost face makes me sick to my stomach though because he is such a shit character and doesn't deserve her.
His power is a lazy cash grab and incredibly boring to play as. He's probably the lowest kill cap in the game. And he is obnoxiously buggy.

But yeah. Please draw the pig having sex with somebody OP. The art is super cute ghostface aside.

There you go friend.

"Annoying as it is, Amanda has never been super into articles that don't involve our pet. I remember the day we first found it......" -Ghostface inner monologue


His power sucks too


Huh, I had no idea she could crouch too. I thought it was just ghost face. That’s pretty cool


You mean:

*weird fucking noise he makes when stunned*


You're right that when you play at lower MMR he destroys and can get lots of free downs but as you get to red ranks many survivors can opress you hard. Usually one survivor will make it a habit harassing you out of stealth and it can become a frustrating experience that forces you to play sneaky and smart, but it's a way different playstyle than killers like Oni and huntress. He's a killer that you can cheese people hard at lower ranks but takes much more caution and skill at higher ranks to pull off without constantly getting revealed.

I’ll have to agree. Ghostface is heavily overrated in terms of his power imo. His power isn’t bad but it requires the survivors to not notice you, which they will, and not to be running Spine Chill(cause f0ck this perk). It has a long cooldown, depends on the survivors, depends on the map geometry and is clunky to lean. Not a bad killer when compared to someone like Clown or Twins(after the nerf) but i still think Myers is far better and more dangerous to try to bully. Body blocking a Myers is like gambling, you never know when it’s your turn to fall. Plus now he can straight up ignore body blocks by stalking through and his addons are Godlike with a power that has pretty much no drawbacks or counters that don’t also apply to Ghostface. Sadly on the skins department he doesn’t have much to offer.


Yeah, she can crouch to lose her terror radius. She also has a special ambush attack she can use while crouching.


That would be a sigh, yes


Yeah. His stealth play style where he goes for hits and grabs as much more fun than the boring stalking  he shouldn't even have in my opinion.

But typically when I see its a ghost face I just decide to follow him around the whole match determined to never let him use his power


The person I replied to requested for them to be drawn having sex


My everlasting hatred for ghostface mains.
And the original comment I'm replying to asking for them to be drawn having sex


Sorry my man, but I'm already Prestige III on Pig, and I have discovered the dark truth:

*There is no escape. There is only snoot.*


what the fuck


what


Yo let my boi vibing around his kidding

I Main him to teabag


I hate looking at him and still getting exposed. He doesn't feel like a stealth killer. He feels like a killer for somebody who doesn't want to learn how to play the game and get decently high results for such a low skill cap. They just put every stealth killer together with none of their downsides beyond the occasional bugged reveal which helps you more than it hurts you.

It's not at all fun to be running from him and have him just go into stealth mode and lean while chasing me for a free instagram. It feels incredibly cheap.


Not to mention there's nothing to learn with his power. You literally just hit one button every 30 or 16 seconds since they all run the same build and add-ons, then hold that button again until you get a free one shot ignoring the second half of a chase.

It's just not interesting to play against. So many people obsess over him and act like he's one of the most fun killers in the game but I have never met anybody but a ghost face player who says he's fun to play against.

His power seems like something they threw together last minute after getting the license in an effort to sell cosmetics and make money. Why do you think he doesn't come with his default outfit? Money.
Seriously can't stand him and the people who play him can't shut up about him even though he's incredibly basic and boring. His power provides nothing new gameplay-wise and has no skill cap since there's no skill to using it beyond looking at people.


Sorry for the rant. Just so tired of this killer getting so much credit while actually fun and exciting skillful Killers get ignored. Oni, Billy, Huntress, Piggy, etc. I despise ghost face, once more mostly because of his fan base and player base. Otherwise I'd be pretty impartial to him as a generic dude with a boring power who's not at all scary or intimidating. Trickster's creepier than ghost face


Wait fuck


I was asking about the second part because I didn't read your other comment so that came outta nowhere


Game Over


what


what


plus a little kiss on the forehead, how does that sound?


Fair. That's the most valid reason I've heard to main him. Since his power has no input or skill or interactivity whatsoever NHS and is incredibly boring for both sides.

Teabagging is the best thing about him. Appreciate the honest answer


I’ll disagree only with the last sentence from that. Trickster isn’t creepy enough imo. He is a K-Pop star with blood spilled on the front. Ghostface isn’t creepy either but the fact he hides and can straight up gen grab you might earn him a bit mire rep there. I’ll agree with the rest and ngl for a second I thought you were talking about Myers with the “I hate looking at him and getting exposed” XD


Oh. Original comment I deleted and this person let me know so I restored it. Wanted to avoid the ghost face fans and killer mains on the Reddit down voting and insulting me over an opinion


#BOOP


What ?


Lmao I love how people downvote you to hell without any input of their own perspectives on this.


And trickster has music made out of screams from his victims, used his celebrity status to murder everyone around him and torture women to death for his own pleasure.

He laughs when I actually while killing people, his voice actor did a fantastic job. Best voice acting in the game in my opinion. A killer doesn't have to look scary to be scary. Not every killer needs to be some giant in a mask covered in blood wielding a knife. Trickster is terrifying to a lot of people especially Koreans and I find him pretty creepy. He's definitely far more creepy than ghost face and legion who are legitimately comedy characters

Because I'm right. And they know I'm right. So many people play this killer but I guarantee it's because he's so basic and easy and just good enough to get them a few kills every match or stomp the occasional solo squad.

His power is literally just hit one button every time it's off cooldown and get a free insta-down that probably isn't deserved because the survivor is more than likely looking right at you in the middle of a Chase, and it's not actually still the gameplay, it's just a nuisance.

Ghostface isn't overpowered by any means. He's just obnoxious, overplayed and the people who play him never shut the hell up about him. They act like he's some incredibly fun revolutionary killer when he was just a lazy power thrown together at the last minute to make some money on cosmetics.


Why must you hurt me this way?


I'm sorry little one :( i just say how i think.
And currently I am just so sick of how many people obsess over ghost face when his power is the lowest skill and most uninspired of any killer


*Elwin puts on his favorite Clive jersey, and turns to face Clive’s picture on the night stand.* 

“I’m going to bed, woman. Don’t try to have sex with me.”


I felt actually gross watching Clive scream at Ifrit to stop dude this is maybe the best intro to any Final Fantasy game like oh. my. god


“Alright you can stop licking my boots your mother isn’t here” Elwin you fucking chad


I’ve known Annabella for a few minutes and I already hate her. Elwin is dope though


The developers were indefatigable in their work and word search for dialogue


That benedikta x hugo scene was straight out of game of thrones lol

"My lion"


I swear to God that Imperial Dragoon was Estinien’s VA.

EDIT: Yes, it absolutely was. Fun Easter egg.


Dude. That “I’ll fucking kill you” was one hell of a line read.


Man, I don't care who the actual antagonist is. For me it's Annabella.


Shippers. I got good news. 

If you walk around the castle, you can hear gossip from the peasants and guards about how they think Clive and Jill will probably marry each other some day because they’re cute together and spend so much time with each other lol.


Active Time Lore is INCREDIBLE


Yeah. 

>!Clive definitely killed Joshua. Damn. That realization will destroy him.!<


I can fix Benedikta you guys


Man, the fact that it was Clive and not Joshua who lost control was not what I expected. 

Ifrit's beatdown of Phoenix in the end was downright brutal.


holy fuck, "I'll fucking kill you" that is so god damn horribly depressing jesus fucking christ I LOVE it


Finished the prologue portion of the demo. So my thoughts..

Pros:
+ Story already has me hooked. The two hours flew by.
+ Voice acting and dialogue is excellent.
+ Soken continues to be the GOAT.
+ Combat is very fun so far, even with the limited tools at the beginning.

Cons:
- Performance issues. None of them really ruin the experience but I noticed how bad the motion blur is at points and you can't turn it off it looks like? Looked to be some frame rate drops here and there too even on performance mode, mostly in the final Eikon fight. 

Overall thoughts: the 22nd needs to get here faster.


Woah. I did not expect that. They basically made a final fantasy game of thrones. I didnt realize it was going to be so adult. I love it. I'm fucking in.


My boy Murdoch 😢


“You cock!”


The ending scene of the demo where Ifrit and Phoenix fight was so heavy. I think this is going to be one of the best stories in FF.


Ambrosia is an actual MVP.

If it weren't for how dire everything was, I'd have died laughing at Clive flopping about like that.

Also, I now have even more fear of Chocobos, and after XIV's red ones that is no small feat.

It is now fully canon they can easily grab a grown person and run away with them full speed leaving said person pretty much unable to do anything about it. What the fuck.

Murderchickens.


Murdoch didn’t deserve to die like that. Rip legend


The moment that most caught me off guard? When Annabella’s handmaidens got fucking merked out of the blue. Sorry girls.


Who here can’t wait until they can play the game and kill Clive’s mother?!! 🙋🏾‍♀️


Joshua :( precious baby boy, I didn’t expect to like him so much.


Legit gonna spend half my time in active time lore.  Gonna earn a graduate degree in Valisthean history


Bro that demo just stolen my wallet, all our wallet. Wtf was that phenomenal shit, it was even better than  a Movie WTF!


So much speculation from that eikon fight...

Clive's pov during that entire time is deliberately very vague and confusing

We never see Joshua actually die either (in human form)


This game is going to be FUCKING INCREDIBLE. 
The story for me hooked, big time. 

Also... Fuck that bitch (you know who).


I definitely didn’t expect to immediately see that much blood


Barnabas's [neckline](https://64.media.tumblr.com/31460afa864311a0a83b4d1f055cd18c/54a003e6a824b8cc-c6/s2048x3072/54480b53472e6b4d660cd1ebfd15e48c057f8186.pnj) in that early scene is almost scandalous.


Ive avoided most info so far, and lemme tell you- the demo was a ride. 

From "my lion" making me realize i wasnt in xiv land anymore (sex? Relationships? Holy shit i can have ships! Actual canon ships!) to the actual gutwrenching sickness i felt during the final fight, i just. 

Going in (mostly) blind was such a good idea, im so ready to dig into this new world.


Dodge being R1 is super unintuitive for me BUT I WILL LEARN, DAMMIT.

Also the opening with you running towards Shiva and Titan while they're fighting almost had me crying it looked so cool.


Did anyone else think Wade and Tyler were gonna be Biggs and Wedge


Hearing “You Cock!” out of nowhere in a Final Fantasy game was hilarious.


Man the dialogue in this game is seriously great. Characters talk and sound believable. No anime grunts. I'm an FFXIV player so I expected this but the difference is night and day compared to FF7R and FFXV


Immediately a GOTY nominee. 

fuck this game is already being slept on how the hell is it not getting even more talk?


Just finished the demo. 

Good lord. CBU3 really knocked it out of the park with this one. This is going to be something truly special.


They captured the weight of how destructive the eikons are suppose to be. Like holy hell I actually felt scared seeing Titan! When Shiva attacked, the way they shot the angles and audio was breathtaking and showed  how powerful Shiva is! Props Square!


Benedikta can step on me any day


I hated seeing Clive’s chocobo get clocked in the face by the rubble as she saved him :(


Demo check-in #1

Heading to Stillwind. I only have two things to say atm.

1. Puppy Torgal is dumb as bricks and I love him for it. 
2. Elwin is a DILF. 

That is all.


Take my fucking money!!!! This demo was amazing ! Holy shit . The Eikon battle was insane ! ! !


Story prologue was incredible.

Will try the specific combat part later.


Ben Starr needs to win best performance. He brought heart to Clive and hearing his story he wasn’t first choice and was technically auditioning for another character but man, guy’s charming af and I hope his future is bright after this.

Torgal though. Torgal just needs his own award for best dogg—wolffo.


I was sceptical as I am almost always nowdays. But damn.. that's the best demo I've ever played.

It really feels like Game of Thrones. Plus they showed most of the scenes in trailer that's from this demo. Now as a player I totally don't know where the story will come next. Plus there is a part from advanced part of the game with more abilities. Plus it's the only game I've played with smooth "graphic mod". How they done that?

I already predict 97 metascore for this game. And I am happy to be gamer!

By the way Active Lore menu is the best addition to videogames ever. I need that in every game now! :D


Jill is definitely giving clive the puppy love eyes in a lot of these scenes. They're juuuust subtle enough that I only really noticed them fully on a second watchthrough of some of the scenes.


“Did Murdoch just….die?”


Ifrit beating the shit out of Phoenix was unsettling when the screen went dark. I was like yo what the fuck


Tips:

* Hold Triangle on the first move of your four-stage Square button combo, for your magic burst to be ready by the 4th swing. Involves claw grip and makes dodging harder, but maximises damage.
* You "parry" by attacking in a way that clashes with the enemy's weapon hitbox on its' start-up frames.
* Hold Touchpad (it's a shortcut) to bring up the Active Time Lore menu. This updates with every sentence said in the demo (i.e., if Iron Islands is mentioned in the next line, pressing it the previous line won't show it).
* Graphics mode has motion blur but there's fairly obvious checkerboarding you can see in Performance mode. I prefer the inconsistent 60fps as the checkerboarding is distracting but you get way more visual information at higher frame rates. Also, higher responsiveness.
* L1 to lock on is a toggle, you don't have to keep it held. Click R3 to swap targets.
* Even if you're locked onto an enemy, you can still tilt the L-stick to immediately switch onto an adjacent enemy.
* Garuda's "Eikonic Feat" (circle button) drags the enemy down into a semi-staggered (no bonus damage) state so you can land a couple extra big hits, but only if the enemy is at half stagger.
* Titan's "Eikons Feat" (circle button) literally blocks everything outside of scripted events as I can tell.
* Turn up the volume when you play to hear the incredible voice acting and music even better.


Ok so demo is downloaded first impressions. Characters models look amazingly good, and everything looks great.

It seems like with normal settings the music is a bit too loud sometimes for the voices to be heard clearly thankfully I use subtitles. May tinker with it when game comes out.

There is also a minor ghosting of Clive (most noticeably around his weapon) as you pan the camera around. This seems to go away under performance mode perhaps it’s motion blur in effect.

Will come back with further impressions.

Seems dodging is a bit more tricky than I had first thought in this game to dodge at the last second seems to happen quite a bit before unlike some of the games I have played.

Wow what a bitch lol


Holy shit man. Just. Holy shit.


Demo was incredible, from story to characters, music, dialogs and of course insane combat system, everything i've wanted and way more.

Only nitpick i have is dodge should be on O and eikonic feat on R1, with A button layout.


Jack Garland walked so that guy from the flash-forward could run


First of all, shit is like a mashup of Game of Thrones and FF, fucking wild. Lots of cursing, lots of death and dismemberment, graphic bloody violence, some dude gets called a “cock”, and there was some heavy duty sex innuendo while a dude had a chick pressed up against a wall, family betrayal, all in the hour or so long demo. 

Combat is better than I thought it’d be, still a little too flashy and warp strikey for me, but I’ll probably end up keeping the easy mode ring on for that. Having the ring equipped seems to make combat more fluid and less of a hassle long term.

Bought the full game as soon as the demo was done,


Feels like they cherrypicked aspects from plenty other fantasy works when crafting this. From the coup that seems straight out of GoT to Phoenix and Ifrit dropping into the darkness like Gandalf and the Balrog. So far this game seems like a love letter to (Final) Fantasy in general and I love it.


Bummed about Rodney Murdoch. I felt he could have been a pretty cool character but we all saw that coming. 

I noticed too Clive’s bearers group is called The Bastards, so Clive is a bastard after all. 😜


To all my fellow XIV players, anyone think that dragoon’s voice was oddly familiar?


Played through the Demo and instantly preordered 😁


My heart ached when you were fighting for your life as joshua. The feeling of fear, confusion and being an Eikon; while still processing the death of your father was honestly emotional.   


Did anyone feel the same? Joshua's VA did an amazing job


Joshua scene was brtual jesus..


I'm highly suspicious of that little red moon/planet next to the big moon.


The visceral intensity in the delivery of the line, "I'll fucking kill you," has left me profoundly shaken, and I love it! It's gonna be a loooong 10 days, ladies and gentlemen.


I love how the trailers created the impression Joshua gets assassinated and Clive goes on a decade(s) long revenge arc to avenge his fallen brother, when it is in fact Clive himself who "kills" (?) his brother. That twist fucking shook me.

That might've been the best opening 3 hours of any Final Fantasy game. 10/10


“You cock.”


It doesn't take long for the story to suck you in. I was worried about struggling with the combat but find that it's felt fairly intuitive so far. I love the parry system though tend to use dodge until I can get the timing down. Overall it's been worth waking up at 3am for.


I was worried about this game, because I dislike games like this. I have processing issues, so it's very difficult to remember to do the combat and dodge, or focus on whats going on and how to control my character. 

I was skeptical of the assists being accessories, but with the ring that slows down before a dodge it has made the game 100% better. I still wish it was menu options, but I am not too bummed. 

I love the setting and the characters so far. Definitely getting the game now.


My god this game is dark…


I finished the demo last night and now I've had time to reflect, that is one of the best introductions to a video game I've ever experienced in my 30 years playing video games. I was engrossed from start to finish and the end of prologue was absolutely brutal and epic in equal measure.

I had high hopes for FFXVI, but this demo blew my expectations away and I'm so excited for the full game now. I just want to carry on right now.

I'm still in disbelief at how good this demo was. (some notable technical issues aside)


GIVE US AN OPTION TO TURN OFF THE **MOTION BLUR** PLEASE. Thank you.


Alright. 

Before demo, I was feeling high 80s on metacritic. 

But I think we’re looking at low 90s, boys.


DONT FORGET GUYS!!! 

FOCUS!

YOU ALL KNOW THE TARGET


Ha ha I loved the way Torgal noped the f out when Clives summon appeared. Smart boy


Imagine what kind of rotten soul someone must have to be a mother to two kids and only think of them as tools.


Did anyone else notice that the Lord Commander got burned up when Clive transformed?


There are so many handsome men in Rosaria's army in the demo lol.


The combat is fucking sublime

I didn't expect to like it this much at all


The realization that Joshua finally took control/aware of being the Phoenix when his eyes turn blue before his last ditch fire breath against Ifrit... Only for Ifrit/Clive to punch a hole in him...  


Absolutely brutal man...


As others have said, my only complaint is the inconsistent frame rate on performance mode, and too much motion blur/blurry backgrounds.  Hopefully they shore those things up.  Other than that, I’m absolutely in love.  The combat is soooo good.


Feels like Final Fantasy has come of age. I admit that I was surprised at first by the more mature themes, but I am loving the game so far. Feels like a game that just gets better and better the deeper you go. Ready for more.


Just finished the demo.  I am speechless and this game is going to be way, way beyond what I even imagined.  My personal GOTY without a doubt.


When you realize 90% of what we’ve been shown is from this demo! Let’s GOOOO


This demo was an experience, seriously. I was hyped before but now I just can't wait for the full game. I'm invested in the characters so much. 

I hope this game doesn't make me hurt much.


Already Rosaria fell. Clive mother is awful I hope she gets wat she deserves: suffering. So can we assume she is a traitor and will side with Sanbreque. Alos Hugo and Benedikta as a secret couple I thought it was her and Barnabas.


So at this point we're made to believe Clive may have killed Joshua. Ofcourse there's always the possibility something else entirely is happening.

I was surprised by how well they categorized Clive's Dad and Murdoch. I was definitely sad when both of them died. 😭


First demo in my lifetime that made me immediately click on the buy button. This is truly next gen Final Fantasy.


All the guys from the final fantasy sub who can’t post there currently are now here and fucking mad at the positive reception. Hilarious to see.


Actually, no, one more thing- the way the controller vibrated in time with joshua's heartbeat- 100/10, cannot stress how much more stressed it nade me, the player


Full transparency: I went into this demo having not been too interested by the trailers or gameplay footage, but decided to give it a go because the previews have been raving about the game.

I'm so glad I gave this a go, that's honestly up there with MGS2, The Last of Us, Persona 5, Arkham Asylum,  and Bioshock as one of the best openings to a game I've ever played.

Honestly the reveal at the end of who the two summons fighting at the beginning of the demo were, and getting to replay that scene but now hearing the dialogue and understanding the stakes was heartbreaking. And Clive's reaction to what was happening has already secured him as one of my favorite protagonists in the series.


Peak FF for me, amazing. I don't like cute anime stuff, so the tone shift to being more brutal and "darker" tone is great


Prediction:

Joshua is not dead (duh, Phoenix), but as indicated by his early conversation with his dad questioning being deserving of the Eikons, he will find a way to get to the bottom of the Eikon’s history and probably won’t like what he finds. 

Wouldn’t surprise me if he becomes a (the?) villain, putting Clive in a really awkward, emotional position.


The only character with plot armour is Clive’s Chocobo. Loved it.


I can't be the only one that thinks Clive *wasn't* the one that attacked Joshua, right? The camera angles were inconsistent.  Specifically, Ifrit was *already* present by the time the game's perspective shifts back to Clive, and he sees the attack as it's already happening.

I definitely think we're meant to be confused by the events, but my money is on Clive assuming guilt because that's what he and the players have been led to believe.  Clive being innocent makes for a much better plot twist than him being the one who attacks Joshua.


When the dragoon appeared, I was like, "that's what kain the dragoon looked like to me as a kid playing ff4 -badass!"


Just so I understood it correctly, Anabella is the duchess of Rosaria and she betrays her husband and the people of Rosaria for a high position within the empire on the condition that joshua was kept safe (which didnt work out in the end) right?


I was on the fence with this game; really didn't care for XV and quit after just a handful of hours. The demo for XVI sold me, that was *incredible*. I really appreciate that SE released this for us to get a look because it 100% clinched my decision.


You're my lion


This is insane. So glad I woke up at 4AM to play it lmao


Just finished the demo, so fucking good. Also she's a bitch, but damn game hit me in the feels, only sucks that too much friendly fire, they didn't have to go out by their own people lol


For the love of god, please they need to add an option to turn the motion blur off, i love everything about this game, but motion blur actually gives me migrains


I'm crying. It's absolutely gorgeous and brilliant. This is Final Fantasy


Playing the demo made me depressed.

Depressed I cannot play the full game yet! I NEED ITTT!!!1


What an absolutely amazing demo. The combat felt so damn good and I was surprised at how much depth it had even though we start out with a very limited move set which just made me even more excited for when I get to try out more Eikon abilities later on. And the game feel is just as incredible as I had hoped they really did something with this game I gotta say. I don't even feel like trying to combat training since I felt the demo has satisfied me enough and I would rather learn new abilities over time than to be thrown a whole bunch at once and then try to figure out what works. 

And the story, hell I was just going to let the combat carry my interest throughout the game since I was pretty neutral on the setting itself, though I did like seeing the crystals and Eikons being the main objectives, but what they showed got me completely invested. I wasn't expecting to feel so much emotion in only two hours. They certainly made use of that Mature rating. Can't wait for next week. This game is going to be a one of a kind experience.


THE INTRO AND CUTSCENES ARE TOO LONG


A good sign of a complete FF game!

*looking at yu ff15*


Played a chunk of the demo, I know save data carries over but you can also save mid-demo. That being said, the save data shows your current party in OG Pixel sprites that was such a nice touch. Oh and for the game itself, completely exceeded expectations, I cannot wait


I am somehow looking forward to the game even more than I already was. Didn’t think it was possible.

You can get real creative with the combat. But man, the voice acting here is phenomenal.


This was Final Fantasy: The Red Wedding addition


The music for the Phoenix and Ifrit fight…

Good lord. 

That music was perfect. Just perfect. It perfectly encapsulated how tragic and epic that entire thing was.


The Joshua section surprised. What I thought was going to a boring shitty child stealth section ended up being a really cool gameplay display of what he is capable of. It really endeared me to him, and the fact he seemed to be strong despite his fragility, and eager to help.


The fight between Ifrit and Phoenix reminded me so much of Gandalf fighting the Balrog.


Holy shit what a gut punch that demo was


My favorite line in the game is “You cock!”


My demo impressions so far:

The story and characters are really good so far. Graphics are mostly awesome minus the lower resolution in preformince mode. The frame rate is hit or miss. My frame rate counter on my tv is showing dips down into the high forty's in the castle training area, It averages around 55 fps most of the time though. I will update as I continue to play.

Update 2.

The frame dips seem to only happen during world traversal. During combat, it is a solid 60 fps, also cutscenes feel perfectly smooth as well.


The Dragoon shared the same voice actor as Estenien! So cool


Cinematography is pretty good, especially in the moon gazing scene.


I just went through the demo, the story is cool and addictive, I already bought the game and I'm waiting for it to come out.  But performance problems spoil the impression, developers should try to make 60 FPS without drawdowns, this is very important for immersion, I hope they will fix it in the release version.


If you have burning blade upgrades you can go wicked wheel-> burning blade mid air-> upheaval as a standard ability combo.


Just finished the demo. Despite already knowing the basics of the story before going in, I have not been this invested in a game's story in a very long time.   


This game is gonna be something special.


Already pre-ordered the game months ago when I was able to but playing the demo REALLY did it for me. Holy shit, this game is going to be something special.

Also, FUCK Clive’s mom. What a bitch lmao


The pacing of the game is incredible so far, it moves from scene to scene flawlessly.


HO. LEE. FUCK. 

As much footage as I’ve seen so far I was completely unprepared for how over the top the Eikon fights get, and that’s only the FIRST of what I imagine will be many. Almost took away the sting of how wildly fucked up and feel bad the story gets at the two hour mark. 

If you neglected the Eikonic Challenge that unlocks after the story, please go play. The combat in this game is out of control good.

I went into the demo totally blind having painfully avoided all trailers for the last few months and my jaw is dropped after playing, now how am I supposed to wait an entire week for more! This has game of the year written all over it, and perhaps we are all about to enjoy the best final fantasy in a generation


Just finished the demo and my lord they might’ve cooked with this one. DAY ONE PURCHASE

Also I’m confused at the people who were expecting Dark Souls level difficulty for the very beginning of a FF game lol


BestDad's head rolling on the ground and Joshua's eyes widening as he's trying to comprehend what he's seeing... That's new for Final Fantasy.


Everyone making the GOT comparison like it's a bad thing. This is going to be an original dark and brutal story and I'm fucking here for it. Incredible demo.


Heads up folks. As of about 3 hours ago we have [photo confirmation](https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-general-discussion-predictions-thread.287810/page-678#post-107403666) that people have the physical copy of the game in hand. A whole ass week early. 

If you want to avoid spoilers, go ahead and set up your blockers now. It's time for media blackout if that's something you're planning to do.


About the story… >!The hooded guy… can he be the guy speaking @2:39 in [this trailer](https://youtu.be/gV5rIW1Qums)? I think he said, ”Awaken child of fate. Awaken Ifrit”!<


That was fucking amazing.


I'm immeasurably confused by Clive's POV in that one scene. I suppose that wasn't him after all?

Joshua's POV scene was from the eyes, but Clive's was... Elsewhere?


Motion blur and some frame drops aside (that I only see clearly because Ive been PC gaming on high end for awhile now, but its 100% not gamebreaking in any way), HOLY SHIT this game is gonna be amazing. About to play the demo again on graphic mode this time..The 22nd cant come fast enough

Benedikta and Hugo was a big surprise, also I like how the active lore says Clive and Joshua look to Jill as a sister. Then when Clive and Jill were on the balcony and she shivered he went to put his arm on her but stopped. That was a neat little tidbit, I can see them ending up as love interests later on.

I also feel like Clive unknowingly was possessed by Ifrit and he's gonna figure out that he's the one that "killed" Joshua

Not having run set to a button and auto loot pickup is great

All in all in my opinion, 10/10 demo, its was everything i've expected. Marbol and Dragoon were kicking my ass for a bit until I got the buttons down, I'd like a bit more difficulty but i'm replaying this on the harder modes anyways so it'll be all good


I was hyped. Now I straight up can’t wait. This game is gonna be an all-timer.


Does anyone else thinks Barnabas was really displeased during the negociations? I'm not entirely sure what to think, it's as if he were too tired and was just there as an obligation or whatnot. He wasn't even smug or imposing, he looked weak, which is really interesting, I wonder if he is, like Cid, being affected by using too much of his Eikon


i would like to play as torgal for 2 seconds and let him rip clive’s mom to shreds. maybe.


Reminded me of FFXIII the whole way through. High quality cutscenes, voice acting and lore/story details accessible through the menus. But mainly due to the linearity. That's not a problem for me - I loved FFXIII and don't mind linear games, but I'll be curious to see reviews since most people complain about it.


That was the greatest demo I’ve ever played by far.


Good to see the subreddit growing


My first FF at the ripe old age of 34.

Watched friends playing in bursts at various other points in the series (VII onwards), but as a big DMC fan, this one looked immediately accessible to me. 

I had already pre-ordered, but wow, the demo blew my socks off. Did a great job of getting you attached to the characters and some early world-building. I enjoyed the combat quite a bit too, although I've not tried the Eikonic challenge, I feel like I want to experience the development of Clives skills/abilities first hand as the story goes on.

9 days to go!!


The amount of streamers who do not weave in magic attacks between melee combos drives me crazy! It looks super spammy when you watch some of those people play it, when it feels just perfect when you actually play yourself!

Demo is a full 10/10


Clive’s mum has to to die. That’s it.


[deleted]


Well that was fucking dark


Was that estinien?


Did everyone else died from ifrit's enrage?

Cause if it's scripted they maybe showing phoenix can revive himself.


Just tried the Eikonic Challenge and yup, Titan is legit my favourite. That giant punch just shreds HP bar. 

Still getting used to landing the counter block though.


i was literally staring at nothing because of the story in the demo, speechless. now i'm hyped af. i cant wait for the release!!!


HEAVY SPOILER FOR NON DEMO PLAYERS











Was it Clive who killed Joshua as Ifrit, just that he couldn’t control it? That’s how I interpreted it, but would love some explanations or opposing views.
Would be a really interesting twist though.


Poor handmaidens tho. I get she had to bring them to keep appearances but damn.


I'm impressed. The opening sequences was well directed and gave me sheer sense of scale that I had not seen in most FF titles. HDR presentation seemed very nice as well, highlighted (not intended) by appearance of Phoenix and all the flames. Speaking of summons, I think this might be the first time where summons felt as menacing and larger than life (literally) in FF game. 15 tried this but it felt off. 16 I think hits the mark. (Hope to see this kind of scale for Weapons in FF7 Rebirth.)

Combat feels nice and fun. Obviously can't speak to depth for now but seems promising. I'm still debating on 30 or 60 for the playthrough. Hope some technical analysis becomes available before release so I can decide on a mode and stick with it.

A little bit cut-scene heavy at first but I think that's to be expected for a high fantasy/medieval setting. Lots of names, objects, kingdoms, etc. Can be little overwhelming and confusing at first. But the spectacle of the battle more than makes up for it. 

All in all, I'm excited for the release. Feels like a true next-gen experience which was solely lacking for the past two and some years.


I played Final Fantasy 7 remake for a bit and thought it was cool but thought FF wasn’t for me. I just preordered the game after playing the demo. I’m so hooked, some of the best writing I’ve ever seen in a game and that’s from a demo?! God I’m hyped up after that.


Love the demo but if you're going to have a lock-on feature then you HAVE to have a way to switch targets easily. It's killing the combat for me


Annabella is the worst, I hate her, that's all.

And that dragoon intro, soooo good. I saw he was voiced by Estinien, that's a cool easter egg.


What a demo!? holy shit


https://preview.redd.it/tzib9e6joj5b1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73365a055dcbc71589aa6aa175614b2b54aa4458

Something to look forward to when I get home from work in 9 hours…


They need to allow us to disable motion blur ASAP


Jesus that was a lot of shit going on in 2 hours. This game is going to be packed


The character’s facial expressions are THE best I’ve ever seen in any game, ever. Very impressive considering XIV is very limited in this regard and this is an in-house engine!


NINE DAYS IS TOO MANY DAYS FUCK

I'm gonna be so good at Chirada/Suparna and Benedikta by launch


It's so awesome to see old Final Fantasy jobs making a return as ones blessed by their eikons (>!Dragoons from Bahamut, and Ninjas from Garuda!<)

Can't wait to see other jobs appearing in the main game 😍


In an effort to wipe recent conversation about Clive’s sexual inclinations off my mind, I wanted to drop a thought about the nature of the Dominants that bloomed during this demo. 

Specifically, I think the Dominants are *chosen* by some conscious entity due to traits innate to them.  

For example, I think Hugo was chosen because of his size and formidability. Benedikta was chosen for her hunger for freedom and willingness to do whatever it takes for her independence. Joshua for his sensitivity and desire to be a supportive force to the people around him. Cid for his leadership instincts and paternal protectiveness of those he feels responsible for. 

And I think Clive might’ve been chosen by Ifrit in that moment of high tension and passion at the Phoenix Gate for reasons we don’t know yet. But lip reading the hooded guy, I’m pretty sure he said “I’ve found you.” As in Ifrit finally finding someone with good resonance in Clive. 

Obviously, for this theory to have legs, this universe needs to be teleological. Fate exists and the nature of a person and the path they walk is determined from birth. So the eikonic entities must have some way to view those threads and select their vessels based on them. 

Or I could be completely full of shit and spinning up wild theories because I can’t stop thinking about this game and am desperate to play as soon as possible. Tbh, this is probably the real answer.


The music, the graphics, the setting and the tone. They just sold a copy.


it took me four hours to finish the story demo because i was savoring it. 

Y'all, that last sequence had me completely stunlocked. Even though I knew how 90% of it was going to play out, I still got overwhelmed by actually playing it. 

Some general thoughts:

* Combat feels smooth as butter. The enemy tells are clear and the precision dodging feels **so freaking good**. Even got in a couple parries by accident and several counterstrikes. 

* The VA is excellent. Contrary to what some of the snippets suggest all the facial animation and voice performances themselves match very well. Even as teens Clive and Jill's voices are softer, slightly higher, and completely believable. Also that f-bomb drop at the end was fucking visceral and I *loved* it. 

* Having played this demo and also dissected trailers like the neurotic asshole I can be, I can corroborate that 60-70% of what we've seen in the trailers was literally from the first major segment of the game. They haven't shown us **a goddamn thing**. 

* Ambrosia is best girl. That's all. 

* Right now, I'm pretty confident about my initial theories but I'm curious to see if/how they subvert them going forward. 

* Also, sorry "they're just siblings" people but after that moongazing scene you can't tell me that there's not *at least a little bit* of something there between Jill and Clive as early as their teens. The only reason Clive would've hesitated like that is if he thought the touch was inappropriate. Speaking of which...

* The demo did an excellent job of getting me invested in the characters without me fully even noticing it happening. Joshua is a sweetheart and much more perceptive than his elders give him credit for. Clive is simultaneously a slightly socially awkward gentlemanly beanstalk and kinda badass already but shy about it??? He's got the purest heart, is respectful of authority, peers, and commoners equally. I like that Jill has a little bit of cheekiness to her personality. She's still unfailingly polite and proper but you can also tell she's got some fierceness hiding beneath it already. 

I'm trying to think of issues I had with it and am currently coming up short. Actually, I did notice some frame rate shifting but I don't use a tracker and it honestly wasn't immersion breaking for me. I guess if I really want to reach, I did find some of the movements, particularly for older female characters a little stiff/awkward looking. But again, not enough to dampen my enjoyment.


“Clive and Jill are just friends.” 

Yeah okay they give each other “I’m in love with you” looks behind each other’s backs like twenty times in just this lmao


"Not a Final Fantasy crowd" on suicide watch after this one.


So glad the demo is releasing at 6PM here in Australia. Then again, given how poor my internet is, I don't know if I will be able to play that much today lol.


I keep staring at Elwin's neck


That Eikon fight and music was crazy. Joshua gave it his all. I think they did a great job of making the player feel like Clive was in that moment and really hating Ifrit.


Cant wait for the rollercoaster of emotions waiting in the whole game


Perfomance mode had some problems but not too big at least for me. Absolutely loved the demo and it made the wait for next week even harder


Just did the combat tutorial and I'm in love. The setting feels like classic final fantasy and the visual style feels spot on. Glad it's not photorealistic. It's just fantastical enough.


The game is nice, BUT the camera setting (PS5) is terrible. Dont know whats going on, but I get sick when I use the camera. Its not near smooth. The only way is to set it to sensibility 1, but then it is ultra slow. Also it doesnt matter if its in FPS or Graphic mode...
Please fix this in the finale game!


I liked the demo and the story seems great I don’t know how I feel about the Combat I like the FF7 remake system better 

I hope they allow me to remap the controls I’d prefer dodge to be circle I guess I could do it with my controller since I own the edge but it would be nice to have the option in game.


I love the ATL system and how it really enhances the game and gives a lot of color to things happening without requiring unnecessary exposition. For example, Wade, the knight that saves Joshua at the start of the battle - if you had looked at his ATL, you know he became a knight because Joshua used his power to save him from a life threatening injury. He doesn't explain that in the cutscene, but he asks if Joshua remembers him nervously. Love how that deepened the scene.


I just finished the demo and the jaw dropping moment of the king being killed and the heart wrenching death of Joshua was really tough. I’m so so invested now.


The new victory fanfare is so epic


Anyone have screenshots of all the active time lore in the demo?


Just finished the first part of the demo and I am not ok with how that ended! Couldn't believe they made our MC kill his own brother, and so brutally!!


Absolutely fucking brutal. This game is going to destroy me. Only complaint I have is the shitty motion blur. Hope they add a way to disable it.


Dawg that Dragoon is so fucking hardcore holy shit.


Other than some visual tweaks and adjustments, this game is going to ruin my life. I need it now


Wade and Tyler could still be alive. Didn't see any indication that they got incinerated like Murdoch when Ifrit showed up.


Rest in peace my dear Chocobo who saved Clive


Is it me or did every time Joshua talk I'm thinking he's gonna yell Amecia


God the final fantasy theme hitting during the dragoon reveal was so hype.


The demo made me extremely hyped for the game


[removed]


The demo was amazing. It left me wanting to play more which is exactly what a demo should do. Just on the demo alone the game is ten times better than FFXV. 

My thoughts:

1. I kind of felt like the beginning of the game was more cutscene than game. Very long periods of time without even needing to touch the controller or fight enemies (made me miss random battles LOL). FF games are usually a bit better about giving you control early and often. That being said the story was so intriguing I just dealt with it. 
2. Since the demo itself actually had very little combat, it was nice to see the Eikon battle mode there to give you a better indication of what combat is supposed to look like and it was FUN. I was initially hesitant about the combat since I like FF7R's combat system, but this one was actually very engaging. 
3. I know this is just vertical slice of an early version of the game but there were some frame drops and stuttering happening throughout the demo. Hopefully they get that smoothed out by release. 
4. The voice acting is actually good. Sometime you just need to hear things in context. I initially thought the voice acting was going to be awful since the few trailers really made it sound kind of cheesy. In context though it's probably one of the better acted FFs. It actually reminds me a lot of FF12 in that respect.


Anyone else surprised by the difficulty of the game?

To be clear, it's not hard at all, but I honestly expected it to frankly be absolutely piss easy and it's not, if you don't get your dodges in you can actually get shredded, this is more apparent in the eikonic challenge.

The timing on perfect dodges and on magic burst combos is just the right amount of forgiving and some videos actually made me think it would've been a LOT easier than it really is.

It seems the game may actually pose a proper challenge at higher level / secondary content and this makes me so goddamn happy.


I see a lot of people are doubting the whole Jill and Clive thing. The first and most obvious thing is the way Jill looks at Clive during the whole demo. However there's something else I found in the demo which I'm gonna spoiler anyway.

>!After you meet the Bearer with the apples, and go up the stairs next the well, you can hear the handmaidens saying something along the lines of, "Look at you two running around together" and "Soon we'll be having a feast about the two of you".!<


Hopefully the frame rate gets smoothed out. The eikon battle was pretty hard to appreciate with all the frame drops and motion blur going on.

Combat obv basic for the intro but targeting enemies seemed weird. I much prefer attacking in the direction I'm moving instead of where I'm looking. Crowd control gets messy when you're reliant on the camera. But maybe I accidentally put myself in lock on mode here idk.

Story so far is the strongest point. Can't wait to see where they build on the eikon conflicts. Also I was surprised at the super dark tone. I knew it was spicy but I was stunned at how many characters just got obliterated.


Demo is amazing! Had to play through the eikon challenge twice. Combat is very fast, fluid and fun. Story has me wanting more. Haven't been this excited for a game in a long time!


So good, exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait for more. Great demo and will certainly hook people into playing more as the story is really compelling as well as the gameplay being fun. The sound production is incredible, that music during the final fight was epic. 10 more days!


guys, for all Diablo 4 players, The VA for the magnificently voiced character of Lorath is a seemingly important character of FF16!

His name is Ralph Ineson, for anyone who wants a quick google search.


Hooded man is late to the reunion... 😅


Just finished it and holy shit is it good


I absolutely adore the little throw back to earlier FF games with the mini sprites in the menu 🥰


Godamn I’ve been watching the trailers religiously and was fully ready for Joshua’s death and it still hit hard


Demo and boom --> Pre-Order!


I've often thought that the subtext of any story-driven game ultimately winds up becoming the story of the game's own development.

Had me delighted when the first words in the game are the protagonist talking about how our ancestors gave us this beautiful power, but we got greedy and relied on it too heavily, and now it's put the whole world in jeopardy.

That's a pretty brazen statement about Final Fantasy / SE's current outlook. Real shot-across-the-bow type writing. Love it.


I'll be honest I'm not much of a Final Fantasy fan but more of a RPG fan. But this demo was one the greatest things i've experienced. Soo excited for the full game.


Are Tyler and Wade dead ? :/// I’m on that cope that they’re both alive because it feels weird that they focused on the scene where Joshua saves Tyler only for him to die minutes later. We saw the other dope dude get vaporized by the flames so I don’t know anymore 😪


what I really love is that in order to use -ra and -ga spells, you yourself have to charge them up, instead of simply having access to them or replacing lower tier ones


one of the best demos I've ever played might have to cop the full game


The part where Ifrit Kills the Pheonix, I can't tell... but is Ifrit Clive having some sort of dissosciative episode? Also, how the hell did Torgal survive this entire event?


It's definitely taking me some getting used to but I'm slowly coming around to the combat. Going from pc mostly to ps5 has been a challenging transition.

Outside of that I enjoy all aspects of the game. The music, voice acting, scenery, gameplay, and world all seem fantastic.

Now if only I could get rid of the stupid motion blur when turning the camera.


Hitting those perfect dodges and parries is soooo satisfying.


demo was great. really reaffirmed my confidence in CBU3. 

some notable takeaways from it:

\- seems to be some motion blur/ghosting issues especially in graphics mode - at first i wasnt sure what it was but i found my eyes got tired very quickly while playing. i found performance mode better on the eyes. 

\- interesting music direction. they use a lot more silence in cutscene dialogue than you would normally expect, which might be why it feel a lot like youre watching a fantasy TV drama at some points. 

\- sound mix seems a bit off. i played with 2.1 on my first go and then pulse 3d headset a second time. its better with headphones, but otherwise a lot of the sounds and voice don't feel like theyre coming from the correct space or are too far away (not loud enough). more evident in the prologue than eikonic challenge, but i do hope its something they will fix.

\- really flexing that m18 rating. the f-bombs feel really well placed and have weight. and obvious sexual references straight off the bat lol. excited to see more.

\- very positive experience. voice acting is superb. combat is snappy and fun. just gotta get used to that R1 dodge lol


holy shit


Loved it, especially the combat in the eikon challenge section! 

Only complaint is that the lighting and effects can sometimes make it hard to see the enemy tells. 

Other than that and some minor performance issues I see getting fixed on another build, I am so excited for this!


i was pretty pumped to see mechs from ff14. i saw gales and was like, hey i know this mechanic already!


SE has something to be proud of with this one.


I know there's already theories that Joshua will come back, cause he is the phoenix after all...but I sure hope he does somehow. After that portion where you play as him I was thinking it would be cool to have a second character to play as with a different moveset


Absofuckinglutely loved the demo. Finished it last night. It blew me away. 

My only gripe is that it seems like there’s some sort of motion blur effect when you’re moving and moving your right stick around. Unless it was just me? Odd camera issues can give me motion sickness, unfortunately. I didn’t experience it with the demo but it definitely messed with my head a bit. 

9 more days!!


I've just beat the demo and i must say this was one of the best demos i ever played, however I have a question, at the end of fight between Ifrit and Phoenix, we receiving Torgal perspective and we can hear his voice ?


I'm extremely new to Final Fantasy - the only game I finished is FF15 (lmao, I know) and... that's it. Still making my way through FF7R which is incredible. Anyway, I just learned that the Eikons and Dominants are direct callbacks to summons and archetypes from previous FF games. That alone made me purchase the pixel remakes just so I can appreciate all the lil callbacks bc I think that's fucking awesome lol


Do you think Clive is Ifrit?


For this FF series, I must say that the lore is kinda dark and intense imo. However, I really like it at the same time. I've played the demo and I really enjoy playing it.


This gonna be that game I wish I could play for the first time again.

Anyone else surprised by Joshua gameplay?  So on top of the Phoenix theme of resurrection and healing, there's no way he's not coming back. They wouldn't waste the assets and development and so on on a one-time sequence in the prologue...

Now I'm just extremely hyped for his return!


Maybe this was asked and answered....or theorized or whatever...

Soooo I think we all assumed it was Clive killing Joshua and he didn't realize he became ifrit....the cam angle gives credence to this.


But I just saw in the trailer for all the eikons and it showed two ifrits fighting each other. Which triggered a memory back to I think the earliest ff trailer of this  scene and they had different eye colors.

Since I refuse to play the demo again so I can relive it next week, go ahead and spoil me rotten. What eye color ifrit did phoenix fight and is it possible that it wasn't Clive but the other one??


Yup, completed the demo. Day 1 purchase for me. That was amazing!


Dont foget guys

Focus

You all know the target


This game looks amazing so far, but man… please can they optimise the 60fps mode more. It isn’t great, even with VRR forced on. It drops quite a lot, and not to an unplayable extent, but man… Square Enix plz


That was nearly perfect for me.  The presentation of the game is incredible, from the music, to the characters interactions to the story pacing.  This feels so much like tactics, but with a bit more of a character driven plot.

I know that some people will complain about lack of combat in the first two hours, but the cutscenes were gripping for me.
There are frame drops, but I wasn't really bothered by them since combat seems to be smooth.  Really my only annoyance is the lock-on.  Idk it just feels bad for some reason, can't quite put my finger on it.    

Also, as someone who was firmly in the Clive/Jill platonic relationship camp, these two hours complete throw that out the window.  There are like 8+ different instances of setting up the inevitable romance between the two in this demo alone  The only way it doesn't happen is if they want to mislead us and fuck with us.


The GoT inspiration is so obvious, and yet it still looks like a typical Final Fantasy in pretty much almost everything that matters. 

It will be a torture to wait 10 more days to see the rest of the story.


Combat demo is so good, there is so much combo potential just with the 3 eikons they are giving you in the demo. Games definitely not a stupid button masher, attacking and dodging feel great. 

Voice acting is top notch( really liking the entire casts voices so far, my favorites are definitely benedikta and cid) and the characters have believable writing as in, the things they say don’t feel out of place, also no anime-tropey dialogue for people who don’t like that

Exploration is the thing you would expect from an action rpg. In the demo it’s nothing too crazy tho, it’s definelty gonna open up a lot more in the main game, probably akin to god of war ragnarok (open zones) There are small sidepaths you can go to for some loot. You can find accessories in the combat demo that enhance specific eikonic abilities (found one for Phoenix that enhances the dmg of one specific ability by 9%)

Story is really intriguing, I love that they are going back to a medieval/high fantasy setting. Also a lot of potential political intrigue a la game of thrones. Probably the most mature Final fantasy to date. Why can’t it be the 22nd already

Performance in combat is great, really fluid on my end (performance mode), in exploration it does dip here and there. Overall I dont regret preordering the physical deluxe edition. 

Also that fucking title screen, that Amano artwork and the FF16 version of the Prelude. All in all, my most anticipated game this year, and probably my personal goty


One of Joshua’s Phoenix attacks being named “awakening” is making me very emotional. We’ve come so far.


Clive def killed Joshua, it’s framed to make it like he’s watching from a distance but I think that’s actually Clive talking from inside Ifrit unable to control it.


I felt more connection to FF16's characters after the *demo* than I had felt for FF15's characters by the end of the whole game.


Never played any FF game before. I never use  my PS5 so I turned it on after months to download the demo because I saw a trailer for it. Holy fucking shit. I’ve never wanted to buy a demo after a game this bad in my entire life.


56min and counting down


Ouhhh it’s downloading. Screaming crying throwing up. But quietly.


hearing the Lord Commander speak: hot
seeing the scar on Barny's chest: SEXY AS FUCK


It’s like the closest we’ll get to a game of thrones AAA game and I love this


FYI holding down the touchpad brings up lore entries relevant to the scene or moment in game which you can even do in cutscenes.

I dunno if the game tells you that explicitly if you don’t do it first.


Played the demo for many, many hours ... yes it's amazing!


A whole mechanic for Aragorn-ing a door open. I love that!!


What a banger intro. Even felt something for the tertiary soldier characters. The only real issue I had was noticeable frame drops during the Eikon fights.


I love this demo so much, but the frame rate dips are kinda annoying, and during combat sequences the resolution lowers more making it look blurry, hoping this is an old build. If not, oh well this game still slaps.


Had a good feeling about 16 since reveal trailer. And I’m still impressed! Only got to the tutorial fight but world building, political intrigue, the war talk, are what stands out the most so far for me. Big fan of 12 so I’m happy to see these mature themes return.


Loved the demo so much that I'm considering not even playing the combat mode. I'm buying it and I want to work up to being that strong.  Guess I'm back to finishing my other Yoshi-P related activities (XIV savage prog) because I'm not going to want to put down the controller on the 22th now.


apart from the performance issues and some controller funk, this is as good as I was anticipating.


Great visuals, story, music and VA. Combat I’m getting used to and is nice. Main things bothering are; poor reso and fps in performance mode (day 1 patch?), poor visibility fighting in dark spaces with amount of effects, little accessibility for a 2023 big budget game (motion blur, visual preference indicators, lock on system is always locked on and never have full control of camera (bit odd, you kinda want either or, not two camera controlled locks to enemies). Some bad visuals in the backgrounds up in the castle if you look out.


I don't have VRR, so the frame drops are quite annoying unfortunately. It's very weird that the cinematic QTEs are locked to 30 fps even on performance mode, and the constant 60 -> 30 -> 60 takes me out of it. It seems like they concentrated on getting 60 fps during combat and left everything else up in the air; overworld fps is very inconsistent.

Target lock-on also makes the camera freak when you back into a wall, so it's probably better to have it off. Also, I don't know if this is because I'm not used to action games, but I'm having trouble getting the timing of the melee -> magic follow-up combo. Haven't seen anyone else mention that, so who knows.

Story-wise we started off great with quite a bit of lore introduction. I'm looking forward to how it develops, especially >!the duchess who seems to be just a power hungry bitch right now lol. Hopefully they flesh her out some more.!<


Ace got akainu'd again..


I had my first experience with the ps5 controller's adaptive triggers which is super cool, I thought I broke the trigger when opening the gate with Cid lmfao


Absolutely amazing prologue. It was gut-wrenching seeing the ending of Phoenix vs the Eikon of Fire… 

My only criticism is I’m on performance mode and the gameplay feels choppy, lots of framerate drops — feels more like i’m playing on 30fps than 60. Hopefully this will change on release? 

Otherwise i’m excited for the 22nd!


Spoiler: I think Ifrit always hated Phoenix. Maybe he never was treated that good.


I gotta say I didn’t expect to play as Joshua and I wish we played as him the whole time.

 can someone explain what the moms deal is?


wru mini-map


Any thoughts on the red star near the moon? Sorry if it’s already been mentioned


I’m really impressed by the demo. The story has really pulled me in. The Game of Thrones inspiration is clear, and the voice acting and visuals just really engrossed me from the get go. The combat is cool and fun, but so so easy. I’m hoping it’s just because we are in a prologue. The gameplay was also wildly linear, again I’m hoping that’s just a symptom of being in an intro and the game will open up as we go. 

Cut scenes and music blew me away.


Anyone want to talk about how the sound design is? Hearing the characters wearing leather walk is just so funny. Even Clive is guilty of the thigh squeak.


Is it only me or does Benedikta and Clive's mom look identical? I'm confused if they are supposed to be the same character or related.


Thought his mom sucked before but the ending is some cold-blooded shit. I'm hooked for sure, I hope it's not a revenge story at least in full.


Interesting how the knights from Sanbreque and Annabella seem to have no clue that there was a battle between two Eikons and that Clive is a Dominant. Shows the indiscriminate power of the Eikons and how vital it is to control information (RIP bird)


I just finished the demo and OH MY GOD. I was having some doubts if I would buy this but after playing the demo I immediately preordered. This demo got me excited to game again. I think game devs should take some notes on how to make a good demo from this one, if anything it got me to buy the game early!


hope clive's mom gets her head sliced clean off.


Just beat the demo — loved it!

I don’t love R1 for dodge and O for the special attack though, might swap those for myself when I play the real thing, kept hitting wrong buttons. Trying to learn the timing on dodges/parries is def gonna result in a lot of deaths for me lol. Don’t really get the added R2 for opening doors and smashing stuff but whatever. I’m sure the gameplay will open up greatly later on, you’re obviously fighting with barebones mechanics. Dunno if I will do Eikon Challenge yet so as not to spoil myself.

Speaking of spoilers, I just love the more mature story, they really didn’t shy away from anything, from sex to violence to profanity, it’s all there. There’s obviously some intriguing plot threads for them to pull on as the game progresses.

Torgal is the most adorable thing on the gd planet, and Clive’s chocobo was a total bro. Joshua seemed like a good kid and Jill is as well, all of them raised by a great father. Which brings us to their bitch of a mom, and I understand the times and society the game is set in but it’s hard to imagine a guy like Clive’s father putting up with a woman like that when he holds all the power in the first place, but what can you do. She’ll get hers I’m sure.

Had a few issues, mainly towards the end, Joshua’s flashbacks as he became Phoenix were WAY too bright, blinding even. And that whole sequence going from door to door in the burning castle where each one felt like a new loading screen was a bit jarring. And I never like the ‘win the battle and then immediately get wrecked/killed in the cutscene after’ trope, so that was a bit of a downer but I can let it slide.

Voice acting seemed really good, and casting Estinien as the dragoon we fight was fucking amazing, even if we did have to kill him, lol.

What the fuck is the point of the next ten days of my life just give me the damn game now Yoshi-P!!!


Even after all the marketing theyve done, I didn't believe they would commit to such a dark tone/story. I love it.


The story is so sad and so good :( the Eikon battle was a little too long of a set piece but still really fun


Wanna know how much I loved it? It’s the first game to convince me to buy it immediately after a demo and the first game in years that I’ve bought without review scores. This demo was that good!

Now I just hope they can fix the performance issues by launch.


Loved it, but my main issue is the controls. I'm too used to Dark Souls and other games for Circle not to be dodge. I swtiched to Type B which is as close as I can get to that same comfortability, but really all they needed to switch from Type A was Cirle and R1.


I was only the most minimally interested before trying this demo and now I'm paying very close attention. Definitely play the Eikon challenge after the story one. You'll get much more combat to play around with


Holy actual shit.. this might be the best ff game I have played. The english voice acting is actually fantastic. Im fluent in both Eng and JP but this english  voicing seems so much more fantastic


Is it just me, or is there heavy indication Clive is that huge monster that fights the Phoenix


Bit bummed you cant custom remap buttons on the controller.

Im gonna look into remapping the buttons on the main ps5 menu, but if you have two controllers, does anyone know if the remapped buttons sticks to a certain controller or both? Or if the remapped buttons stick to a certain psn profile? Basically dont wanna mess up the button mapping for my partner who also uses the PS5.


Just started, the dukes wife is the WORST

Edit: 💀


WE’RE GONNA GET IT BACK IN BLOOD FOR YOU JOSHUA!!!


man i'm so losing my mind about this game that i dreamed of it tonight  


i dreamed that leviathan was a boss battle and an eikon we could acquire skills but he was locked on the post game and behind an 80 floors dungeon   


it would be cool if my dream is just a premonition


Liked the story way more than I thought I would, definitely got me way more interested in the game.

The first area when Clive is young is blurry as hell on FR mode but it got a lot better after.

The Eikon challenge showed the potential of the combat system once you get a bit more into the story. Really looking forward to just being able to go into the world and explore more.

Edit: I thought of one thing I didnt like and that was the motion blur. There seriously needs to be an option to turn it off.


Does anyone know if there will be a playtime counter in the full version? Small detail, but I like seeing it and ps5's own counter is really unrealiable.

Also anyone noticed how the Phoenix vs Ifrit music has a note progression that sounds just like part of Zelda ALttP Sanctuary theme? Probably unintentional but that made me like the track even more


When was the last time a demo made you cry?

Joshua watched his own father murdered in front of him, then Clive was stuck in the body of a monster that murdered Joshua.


After playing the demo and fighting Benedikta, I have to laugh at the misogyny of someone on here over her tantrum after the battle. Plenty of men scream and shout but because her voice is high and feminine it's seen as over emotional. Pleaee do better...


I started the demo expecting it to be mid cause I’m a turn based final fantasy fan who is salty since the change but OMG I finished it and pre ordered it I’m excited good job SE good job


This isn’t gonna be surprising, but so far the story of the game seems really REALLY good. I guess it’s safe to assume that Clive really is the one who killed Joshua.?


fuck it. Buying a ps5 now


[deleted]


Yeah, this basically all but confirms that >!Clive was the one who killed Joshua and has to eventually come to terms with that. Whoever the hooded guy is, he's not Ifrit.!<

RIP the right hand man knight. For a moment I thought he was gonna escape.  


From a gameplay point I'm mostly excited. My only main concerns are apparently there is no way to turn off that action list which just feels like pointless clutter to me. Hopefully the final release has more robust options in UI customization. Also I don't know how I feel about there always being a soft lockon. It feels a bit awkward with a crowd of enemies but maybe I just need to get used to it.


Something I noticed but haven’t seen mentioned by anyone yet - in the scene after the dragoon fight when Clive whistles for his chocobo briefly, the soundbite for the whistle is the same one used in the ending off FFX when Yuna is whistling at the ocean before her speech. Thought that was neat!


Played the demo once. Didn't enjoy the button mashing at first but after playing the Eikonic gameplay demo three times to try different things, absolutely love the combat. It's only button mashing if you don't try to be patient with your moves/abilities. Gameplay also creates high replay value with so many varying/potential combos.

Story has amazing potential. 

Soken is a god. That Ifrit vs. Phoenix theme is god-tier.

Been waiting for a FF game to get me excited since X/XII (not counting 7 remake). It's been 17 years. Demo alone blows FFXV out of the water in terms of presentation. Game not only has GOTY potential, but FF GOAT potential imo. 

We shall see soon!


Wish there was a preload but it's probably not that big since it's just the demo. my 30mb/s gonna be struggling still lol


Just found out that I can rent a ps5 + game in the asian country I'm staying in this summer. Won't be missing out this summer :)


Just made it to Phoenix gate and my heart is racing I'm so scared of what happens next


Wow that was amazing. Good night


I actually really enjoy it, I kind of wish I could manually change controller layout tho, but story and gameplay wise I’m hooked, I laughed, I smiled, I got angry and I cried 💀


Finished the initial opening demo. Already really enjoy the soundtrack, Story and i am hooked if you do not want to play the demo stay out of this thread you want to experience the beginning without being spoiled. I have no complaints at all battle system feels really responsive i just need to master the dodge better.


Did Murdock die?


The combat was one of the things I was worried about because the trailers made it look dry... Like it was so flashy but in a bad way? However it's very dynamic and feels very fluid. Especially since the parry is tied to the attack button, feels very intuitive. However the dodge timing was a bit too forgiving, I'm used to 1 second before dodging and this is more like 2 seconds before. Also the counter fades maybe a bit too quick for my liking. I kept forgetting to use it but these are the trials of different games with new mechanics so, it feels like a very user friendly experience. Hopefully there'll be much more challenge later on because the demo was VERY easy, even in action focused mode.


Demo was great! The graphics and voice acting is spot on. A bit cutscene heavy and some scenes were a bit strange how they transitioned (a lot of fade to black) but they still had you hooked. 

I thought the trailers were too spoilery, but from what we got in this demo, a lot of what we have seen has come from the first couple of hours. 

Can’t wait for the full game.


I just put it together. She was trying to sleep with him to get pregnant on the presumption that the duke and Joshua would be killed the next day. Being pregnant with the presumptive next heir of Phoenix would give her more leverage and power within the Holy Empire.


GIGADAD moment


I rofl’d at “I’m going to bed” *rolls over fully dressed*


Yeah, i felt sick to my stomach like. Oof. That was heart wrenching.


Absolutely insane. The story in this is going to be something else of what we are used to. This is some truly dark shit. 

It was my understanding that Ifrit was Clive right? Since he’s the dominant, which makes it even more fucked up


[removed]


Ben Starr is AMAZING in this.


When you consider all the blood and gruesomeness that the game had no issue showing us up until that point, ***what did Ifrit do that merited a complete black screen?!***


Felt sick hearing him beat Joshua to death(?) against a black screen. The performances are already stellar


And to think the VA was not even auditioning for the main role lol. He was going in for a minor character and the actual VA cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. He thought he'd get fired at some point for not being good enough! Poor dude did so amazing though.


Didn’t expect much from Elwin but the short time we got him made me really like him


Bruh definitely didn’t expect him to say this lmao


Elwin based as hell.


Wade was mvp


Elwin doesn’t have a head


Koji out here expanding the English player population's vocabulary one FF game at a time.


That is a title and word used in XIV. Plenty more verbiage is expected anon.


Felt ashamed that I had to look up *indefatigable* 🙈

Got hit the books with obscure and verbose language again!


I did NOT expect a motorboat scene in a Final Fantasy game.

&#x200B;

Mature indeed lmao.


Yep 100% gave me GoT vibes too, also I loved the line "You cock"


I was too busy fangirling over the Kain pose to notice! The easter eggs are all over the shop 🥳


Too bad we had to bury him in the muck, feels wrong when our bro is a baddie


I swear Urianger was in there somewhere too at the end


My jaw dropped. Best Performance TGA nomination incoming!


My boy got that Shulk “i’ll kill you” moment. Too good.


I was genuinely shocked at that scene.


Yes! Fuck that bitch!


I am going to laugh if CBU3 ends up making one of the more memorable FF romances. Especially since Yoshi-P has said that they avoid that stuff since they aren’t good at writing romances.


I just hope she doesn't die like >!Luna!<...


I'm not surprised. Usually when girls are wards, it's to spend time with their future spouse as children so they are more likely to get along in the future and form a bond.


From how I understood it, it sounded like Clive and Jill might've been a political match as far as people in the court were concerned. I think a line of dialogue went ''And look at you two, looks like we'll be having another banquet in the future.''


Yeah, it's really neat for picking up the little bits.


I was so engrossed during cutscenes and gameplay I didn't really use it. I hope there's an in-menu lore book somewhere.


It is a great feature but as a commenter below you said, during cutscenes I was, you know, focusing on the cutscenes. It never crossed my mind to use it then.

Hopefully the main game has an ongoing compendium of lore that updates constantly and can be accessed from the pause menu. Off the top of my head GoW and Ragnarok have this.


Did he though? It seems his body was used more like a vessel?


She will make me worse


My impression was Clive's mind was taken over by the hooded guy.


We don't know, losing control was suggested but we also had different perspective of clive and he wasn't found at place of Phoenix to maybe it is false clue? Or he was possesed, controled by something else then Ifrit?


I'm torn between performance mode for 60fps 75% of the time, or graphics for the shinies + locked 30fps 95% of the time. Final Eikon fight really dipped down to 20 on graphics during some segments but considering what's all going on and running at 4k i'm not surprised.


I do hope they can let you toggle motion blur.


They said that was their goal even in the first interviews about the game. It is a back to the roots FF in the high fantasy medieval aesthetics but with the maturity and plot twists of a more adult series like Game of Thrones.


More than the size of the eikons and the environments in which they fought, >!the way Ifrit and Phoenix burned Joshua and Clive's allies as a byproduct of their power!< is what sold me on the strength of these eikons.


Lord Commander Rodney Murdoch


Don’t know why! This hurt me too!


It was actually painful to watch. I’m so ready for this ride


Don’t remind me of the red chocobos…

Please


In before Ambrosia is secretly the chocobo eikon.


Yea man, Annabella is ruthless, they were like her personal servants


Yo me too! I was like, "but why even?" That lady is cold-blooded..


Also also, not only did she let the empire take Clive as a soldier, but the fact that he has the Bearer tattoo in the present day means he’s a slave. 

Stone hearted bitch literally sold her firstborn son into slavery….

Idgaf, no amount of sad backstory revealed in the full game is ever gonna be enough to keep me from hating her and killing her


So little screentime, so much primal rage built up inside of me. 
I wanna gut her the same way Ifrit did with little Joshua >:(


Absolutely stunned by how much I hate her


At first I was like wait a tick did she.... then I'm like Ohhhhh...


I kinda thought his voice was a bit too childish when I heard him in the trailers, but actually seeing him in game though he is very endearing.

Even when he became Phoenix his internal monologue is still about him trying to stop Ifrit's rampage. Which makes it when he gets beaten down by Ifrit in the end to be really painful to look. 

Under that flaming bird of rebirth body, he's still just a little boy.


Agreed about Joshua. The Phoenix is known for rising from the ashes after all. That may not be the end of him


I'm 100% positive he's alive. Maybe he never died, maybe he resurrected himself with the power of the Phoenix. 

I mean, even the logo is a Phoenix x Ifrit showdown, it must have a significance that goes beyond the first 2-3 hours of the game. 

Also I saw Joshua voice actor on Instagram saying he dubbed "Young Joshua". I found the "young" part amusing, I mean, it's obvious he's young, why specify? Only if there is also a voice actor for an older Joshua...


For me it was "Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!"


Yup,  a reminder they are going full M for Mature


They're gonna do insane things to that man


I was \*not\* expecting that ending with Clive & Joshua, holy fuck! SE is pulling no punches with the story and I love it.


I was like... 80% blind too and it's been an insane awakening today 😂


Yeah I’ve gotten so used to dodge being on the circle button that it messed me up a lot during the dragoon fight lmao


You can change the controls in the menu. The option are limited by 3 config and they are very different from each other.


Ngl I was a little disappointed when their names came up and it wasn’t Biggs and Wedge.


My headcannon is that they were Biggs Wade and Wedge Tyler.


That made me burst out laughing, but man it just works.


Me too - this is what has me happiest. No corn, no annoying ‘cutesy’ anime stuff, and great lip sync!


Now that you mention it I don't remember any anime grunts. That's awesome. I loved FF7R, but the anime grunts were a bit much lol


I assume ToTK will win but I genuinely dont care. This is 100% my GoTY


Specifically not being talked about on reddit cause r/ff and r/gaming are private ATM. Re4 chainsaw demo was all over reddit, this demo would be too if reddit was actually active rn


That whole sequence where Clive and company are scampering through the landscape while the Titan and Shiva battle rages all around felt rather harrowing. I love the way you can feel Titan's steps in the controller and see them in the environment around you. The cinematography has been top notch.


You cock


They at least made sure to show her getting up and safely escaping. Can’t say the same for literally anyone else…


Active lore is SO helpful


Especially when he talks to the apple guy and his owner. I also liked how he went to put his arm on her on the balcony when she was shivering but he stopped, def potential love interests when they get older


Yes. It's pretty obvious. Which scares me because of the nature of this story...


"You know, it was really unclear."


Vaporized I’m afraid.


Wow what a bitch lol

Lmao I like how you don’t have to describe the character yet I know exactly who you’re talking about. I was like “girl….”


Hopefully we can remap in the main game


The coup is actually straight out of Dune! It is pretty much the same plot in the beginning.


He died so quick which was weird. He was kind of midsentence and then already vaporized


It was Estinien's VA wasn't it?


Bro as soon as he uttered a single phrase I screamed I love estinien he is my favorite character in 14💀💀💀💀


Pretty sure it’s the same voice actor. Which makes sense that CBU3 would use the same voice actors from FFXIV if they were available.


Same lol. I was already hyped but the demo blew off my pants.


They really nailed Joshua’s segment… the confusion and fear when he was Phoenix was heartbreaking.


The part that got to me the most is how he builds himself up to be brave and follow his brother's teachings while unknowingly fighting that same person. It's implied that Clive wasn't in control, but I doubt he will see it that way.


They really went all out with that mature rating didn’t they? 
Didn’t know if I was going to handle that pounding scene if it kept up.


Giving me big Dalamud vibes


Cock? In my final fantasy? Disguting. Where? Lmao 🤣


I love reading stuff like this. It's great knowing there's accessibility options available for everyone to enjoy.


Right! That ending left me feeling sick.


PLEASE


Honestly was making me feel a bit woozy.


Going all in with such a strong opening i am expecting a hell of a story i think mid 90s is possible. Ultimately i do not care though as long as i enjoy it.


SHIVA'S


puppy torgal is simultaneously the dopiest and smartest creature i've ever had the pleasure of companionship with in a video game.


their decision to not invent armor that covers their arms was ultimately a bad one for them, but boy I'm not complaining


It looks like the himbo military and I'm here for it


You know that is a FF game when everyone looks hot.


This was the thing that left me thinking - I assumed that was Clive as Ifrit. But in the later section of the demo, the set up says that Clive has set out to find that other fire eikon. If Clive wasn’t aware of himself that’s well and good, but then who is the second Ifrit from the trailers??


Benedikta rides everyone on this game


I think it was fairly obvious Benedikta is playing him lol


Clive's Dad was great, especially after having seen his mother first.
Unfortunately we pretty much knew he would die, but that would be killed by an cowardly ambush of people he trusted instead of fighting in the battlefield really hit me hard.


Clive did mention a few times in the demo that the hardest part about protecting joshua is protecting him from himself, which could be how clive feels having to fight a villain joshua. The game's logo is also ifrit and phoenix fighting, so it is probably more relevant than just the fight in the opening of the game.


I think you're right especially because there's a trailer with two Ifrit fighting. Plus we also see some kind of shadowy person on fire before Ifrit appears. Very curious as to what this all means and how we get there


As far as we know, yes that seems to be the case.


Same here. Barely cared, now want hard.


I was always interested but was planning on waiting since Spider-Man and FF7 Part 2 are also coming out soon. The demo just made it my first day one buy of the PS5.


As flawed as ff15 is, it’s still one of my favorites. The story had so much more potential than what was ultimately realized though and it is a shame. But combining the whole story, the dlcs, the anime, and the movie makes for a pretty great , if again flawed, narrative. I think it will always be one of my favorites, but  also have that feeling of what if they had truly nailed it.


Clive was detached, watching whatever took over him and turned him into Ifrit murder Joshua - much of the sequence was from Ifrit's POV.


The finale of the Phoenix and Ifrit fight is so fucking brutal. I kind of wish they would have shortened that just a tad bit lol. With Joshua's voice over in that scene it definitely felt a bit overwhelming. After finishing, I stared at the screen for about 10 minutes trying to wrap my head around the feels that demo gave me. It does a great job of getting you fully invested in the story.


Yeah it's scripted. I dropped his health to 0 and he still killed phoenix.


If you don't reduce Ifrit to 0 in time, phoenix dies and you get a game over instead. Luckily, there is a mid-fight checkpoint so I didn't lose much progress when I tested it.


His third ability that parries then does jojos punches is so much fun to use


[deleted]


The game doesn't tell you but clicking R3 while locked on lets you switch targets but yeah I had the same complaint at first


> Ambrosia is best girl

fucking cosigned

I was super impressed with the way the models were touching each other. The punches into the chest we've seen in trailers, but Elwin touching Joshua's hand, helping Tyler walk (RIP Tyler you didn't deserve to die) - I'm so used to game designers going out of their way to prevent character models from intersecting and clipping.


Yeah I was in the Jill/Clive will be platonic camp and that is out the fucking window already.  The amount of setup in 2 hours was hilarious.  At a certain point I was like WE GET IT.  But of course that will all pay off later in the game like all setup is meant to do


Also there was a small flourish of Tifa's theme in the melody of the song that played when she prayed😳


Nah, any survivors were offed by Empire in the morning, nearly including Clive.

Hoping they do though, dey real bros.


I hope I'm not giving false hope here, but if you look closely at the cutscene, the Lord Commander gets Ambrosia up and she sets off running as Clive starts having his headache. This mirrors how Torgal whimpers and starts running away from Joshua when he starts screaming.

Since we know Torgal's alive, I think we can probably assume Ambrosia's alive too? Maybe?


I am 95% sure she is coming back with a badass eyepatch


I squirmed in my seat with that hit.

This demo had me audibly gasp, give “oh shit” “fuck” “damnnn” “oh god” “wow”.

I don’t know the last time I viscerally reacted to a game so much in such a period. I know the beginning is probably disproportionately filled cinematically, but damn did they fucking CLAP.


FFXVI is not a real Final Fantasy. [Real Final Fantasy games don't need to resort to swearing.](https://imgur.com/a/HRacw1W)

>!lol!<


Anyone who played ff as a kid, even teenagers who played XV would be old enough for the M rating so it’s totally appropriate imo


I accidentally shamefully died at the last part of Phoenix vs Ifrit fight bc I kept trying to shoot his massive fireball instead of him. Lmao moment for me


They are literally hitting you over the head with it during those two hours. Jill is very obvious. Clive comes off aloof until that balcony scene and you just go, "oh, it goes both ways". Clive just isn't confident.


Jill and Clive not getting together would be a subversion and a poor one. But these writers are good, and it’s very clear they are setting up a romance between the two.


You know them mfs dead af they are named Tyler and Wade and no last name

If they had names like Ramza Beoulve or Delita Heiral they'd be alive


It’s deliberately ambiguous. They pretty much want us to leave the demo questioning:

* Was Clive “inside” Ifrit but not in control?  
* Was something else inside Ifrit and Clive was pushed out of his own body and begging them to stop?   
* Is Torgal (or Clive (or someone else???)) some kind of warg that can share consciousness with other beings? 

Honestly, I love it because they’re essentially subverting our prior knowledge from the promo material. Everyone who’s watched a trailer  knows Clive can control Ifrit. But was he controlling *this* Ifrit? Are there multiple Ifrits? Who the hell knows lol


I think he had a dissociative episode and killed Joshua as Ifrit ye


I'm not so convinced. I'm talking out of my ass, but his overall kit was pretty simple. Probably didn't break the bank on development and was just meant to sell the scene of confusion and uncertainty (kind of like how you play as Joel's daughter for five minutes in The Last of Us).

I could see some kind of spiritual communication or something, but bringing him back undercuts the trauma and mission of Clive.


I feel like it’s framed to make it obvious Clive did it lol. Like he thinks he’s an onlooker but he’s actually the one killing Joshua


Her active lore entry says she was raised her entire life to produce the Phoenix, and since Clive wasn’t one her entire life said “he’s a waste, make another baby”. 

Her sticking *to* that is bc she’s a real piece of work.


She craves power.  Joshua gave her power, that's why she "loved" him.  Now that he can't give her power anymore, she's done with him and quickly moved on.  She's absolutely heartless.  Even Cersei Lannister loved her own kids.


Me, a XIV player - " Haha, that's Dalamud."


Clive is so mature he never seemed to be bitter towards Joshua at being the dominant while he was the first born and he's physically superior, and he wasn't bitter at his mom either it seemed, just disappointed

Even though his mom was about to have him killed and instead had him branded and enslaved, he seemed to only care about his brother and father he loved seemingly being dead


Pretty sure that's the case. They didn't show Clive while Ifrit was beating Phoenix to death, so I think the implication is that was his internal monologue speaking while he was possessed by Ifrit.


Was that an actual complaint by someone here?


You can click R3 to swap targets, I believe.


Dude. I'd kill to have 30mb. Mine maxes at 2mb


Murdoch got roasted dude


He got cooked


Right as he says his last line, you can see him getting burned to a crisp. Or rather, if you don't blink, you'll see it because it happens so quick LOL.


I don't think so -- the ATL entry on her once you find out she was a traitor makes it sound like the intention was for Joshua to live and for them to go to the Empire together.


That's how you know it's CBU3, a true FF14 moment


Oh yeah like I'm rarely disturbed about stuff like that in media but there are those few exceptions like watching Ned Stark get decapitated, watching that ballerina in John Wick peel her nail off, and watching Clive kill his little brother


I believe so as when that was happening the screen had the same filter as when Joshua was Phoenix


it’s up in the air. I feel like it’ll be a big plot point. Many questions to be answered and paths they could go down for the story.


Thought he was gonna be a bad father to Clive and a good one to Joshua but he’s actually a pretty decent king looking out for his kingdom and sons.


And he is a blessing for it.


You, me and most of us. Went with contextual clue first but juuust had to double check. 

Yea gotta improve on our vocabulary to be as puissant as Annabelle


Horny Square used their first few min of having a FF rated M for this


It has been awhile since the last legit FF romance. I don't count... whatever that attempt was with Luna and Noctis was.


Considering how the story is going in this prologue (dark as shit) I am fully expecting at least one of them. Or both… 

Fucking loved the demo.


At least she'll actually be a character in the game instead of a plot point for about an hour before it happens. Still can't believe that character got shafted like that when the 13 versus trailers showed their previous version fighting with a cool rapier and doing boss shit.


It still happens. Any time a boy and girl are friends, older people are always like "Oh they make such a cute couple" or "When are you going to ask her out?" Sure made gay young me awkward.


Whether or not Joshua will come back is to be determined (he is the Phoenix after-all)  But the bigger point is that Clive at least thinks someone killed him. The start of the game shows him reflecting on the fight bc it clearly still haunts him


he's still definitely going to blame himself though and the angst arc is going to be incredible


This is why I don’t let strangers borrow my Eikon.


True, I suppose what I meant was that I assumed it was Joshua who went apeshit and destroyed stuff and when Clive saw this he somehow awakened Ifrit to try and stop Phoenix. 

Turns out it was the opposite, Joshua is surprisingly lucid even as Phoenix and he was the one who tried to stop Ifrit.


Absolutely. Tyler's newfound hope in seeing the flames of Phoenix, followed swiftly by the utter oblivion by Joshua's own flames. It's a hell of a mockery to their belief on Phoenix.

It really sold the impression that Eikons are basically nuclear bombs.


Eikons is basically Valisthea nuclear race


Red Comet from Bozja has descended


Earlier in the demo when you’re walking around the castle she DOES tell the girls that it’s on their heads if anything happens to Joshua…


No witnesses


Not to mention she’s the one who sold them out to the empire and led to everyone’s death


I *love* that they twisted the normal "evil father" trope and made it an evil mother. Don't see that very often in a gritty medieval fantasy revenge story!


The anime-protag declarations Joshua made in that fight really made his brutal death hurt 3x more for me.  He was just an optimistic boy wanting to help people.  He deserved better.


We still have Phoenix vs Bahamut fight (as shown in State of Play)


Lemme tell you, going from "huh, whats up with the tattoos" to "oh. Thats whats up with the tattoos. Fuck." Was a miniride in and of itself.


No custom controls though unfortunately and none of the three presets are what I want


I almost thought she was bout to pull up and smack that dude. Then they started talking about fucking in their fancy medieval vocabulary.


I'm a huge Zelda fan and as someone biased as hell towards it, FF16 and RE4R are the only worthy competition this far


I really liked the Active Lore. When you're introduced to a Branded for the first time, it's clear they're a slave. You don't need to know why, just that they are. But if you do want to know more, a quick tap of the touchpad and you're sorted. Great addition.


Yep, she definitely has feelings for him. And it's all so subtle because they show it through her mannerisms and the looks she gives him.


>which was weird.

He did have a fire deity spawn right on top of him to be fair.


Yea it for sure is and they def had him do it as a nice nod, Estinien’s my fav scion so hearing him and seeing the kain pose at the start made me do the point like in that meme lol.


Also the part where Joshua as an Eikon is still thinking on how to save everyone while managing ifrit was touching. He had good role models


pppppplllleeeeaaasssseeee


Torgal is like Slowking, dopey as fuck but also damn terrifyingly smart.


Omg I know right. Like towards the end when you compared to the opposition like why are your armour so crappy but man those perfectly smooth hair are so worth it. Rest in peace though you sirssss


Clive was watching it happen, unable to control what was going on.

It seems to me that the second Ifrit is who/whatever took control of Clive and forced him to murder Joshua.


Same, especially after finding out how he was with his men, close with the captain, and that part where he shuts Annabella up was amazing.

Really showed how he also wasn't a dominant but was still able to do such a great job as the head of the duchy, when he had to replace his father.


You can actually fail it though, I shot the orb first and didn't have time to finish him off. He does the same attack but there's no Phoenix revive lol.


You just changed my life. Thank you


It does tell you…in the controller layout.


I think so too coupled with the fact it only looks like she lost an eye. Then again the tone of the demo mirrors early GoT where no one is safe.


Yeah, Clive's confidence as a person is completely nuked from the abuse his mother puts him through.


I hope they go with it all the way. Tired of always getting tragedy in romances. My one hope is that they very clearly took inspiration from God of War with the scene where Clive's hand hovers over her back. It's very similar to how Kratos couldn't put his hand on his son's back at first. And Ragnarok had an overall feel good ending.


Dang that's you when you talk out your ass?  If only more ppl were as reasonable when doing so. I think you brought up some great counters.

I agree that bringing Joshua back *could* undermine Clive's arc, but I also think the writers are seasoned pros and aware of these kinds of things.

I think Joshua coming back could work without undercutting Clive, where he comes back but in a very limited form, like if he were to be incorporeal or although he comes back, he's not actually there to stay. Would be a real tearjerker if *Joshua* ends up being the one to protect Clive, Reverse Uno Card'ing Clive's promise to Joshua.

At the end of the day, do I think Joshua should come back and risk jeopardizing Clive's arc? No. But I definitely *want* him to and I think the writers could make it work.


Damn I forgot Active Time Lore is a thing, I should check that sometimes. 

I get just from the story that she considers Clive a failure cuz he wasn't Phoenix, but I didn't expect that producing Phoenix was her actual life goal.


Yea, one of the Sanbreque goons even says “shame about the Phoenix” [paraphrasing] after the battle at Phoenix Gate. They intended to take Joshua alive.


Yeah, that’s what I was thinking, he might not *be* Ifrit just yet, but he definitely saw “through” Ifrit and couldn’t do anything


Yes so true! Glad he wasn’t with his wife’s thinking.


It seems like they went after a Ned type situation with him and completely nailed it. He's a standup dude and great father. And got beheaded due to traitors while one of his kids watched.


What do you mean that being a pen pal isn't true love??


My crack theory is that Joshua gets revived, kidnapped by the true villains, gets brainwashed / indoctrinated, and by the end of the game, turns into the final boss. It would bookend their first encounter as Ifrit and Phoenix and reinforce the significance of the title logo.


It doesn't it seem like Clive thinks he kills him... He says "I'll fucking kill you" I don't think he's talking about himself lol


I was there when the comets invaded Yanxia and corpses of my fellow warriors of light piled up. All we saw was bright red feathers summoning hot rocks.


If I could change the dodge from r1 to circle from preset A, it would make it perfect.


I almost thought they were about to get it on right there in the hallway. Like a large train going in a small tunnel


Exactly. I love souls games but the way lore is presented is really lost on me and as a 40+ year old with 2 little kids, I just don't have time to delve that deep. What a brilliant way to handle it.


The active lore thing said that it’s actually her bloodline responsible for producing phoenix, not the archduke, though they are cousins.


Yep. And in the scene before she tries to sleep with Elwin she's trying to convince him not to even bring Joshua.


He’s talking to the Eikon of fire or whatever is clearly controlling his body.


Cut back to the previous room with the table shaking and the guy who was getting smoke blown in his face lookin flustered. Meanwhile, everyone else is just chillin like they’re used to this.


After you clear the demo there is a bit of additional content that is a time jump. Clive is now 28, and sneaking into a castle with Cid, looking for “Ifrit’s Dominant” that is rumored to be imprisoned there. There is also some lore saying that he is investigating the events of his past trying to make sense of it all. 
So even 13 years later, he believes he witnessed someone become Ifrit and killed Pheonix/Joshua. Honestly I would have preferred that all the promotional material and game art did not so obviously spoil that Clive is Ifrit, because it seems that the game is building it up as a big plot twist.

Cool robot. Not an effective Battlebot


I need one set up like the spherical killer robot from “the Incredibles“ movie


[deleted]


Rocky!


My brain has a hard time seeing this as real, the future is going to look weird


"It's bigger! It's badder!! Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. Incredible!”


More info here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gb1BBlk7lk


Well, just hire these guys to do Project Hail Mary. Toss some foam rubber on that and you've got Rocky nailed.


You built a replicator. Don't.


Geth armature.


That would be so cool to have. Could you imagine being in your house and asking the end table next to the couch to go get you a beer? That would be so awesome lol.


Anyone else getting “Replicators” from SG1 vibes? That ended well


Stupid sexy killer robot ♥️


This doesn’t stand a chance as a battlebot


There's something really satisfying about watching really good IK programming at work. That is so smooth and well coordinated.


Cool but will it survive against a lawn mowing blade?


I don’t even think the Boston Dynamics robot would survive a battlebots fight… all their stuff is pre-programmed choreography, wouldn’t be able to respond to commands fast enough in a real world scenario.


Then a spinner removes all of its legs in the first 8 seconds.


So cool, yet utterly terrifying.


Oh no, replicant from stargate.


Perfect side table to rest a beer on.


Will be fucked against any horizontal spinner


Does this remind you of the robot in incredibles or is it just me?


"Battle" bot? Have they never watched battle bots? Even the bad ones would dismember this thing in like 20 seconds.


Extremely cool movement and smooth operation. The very second a horizontal spinner like Tombstone even looks at it, it will explosively, rapidly disassemble and be flung across the battle box.


I better buy stock in battle bots cuz they gonna get crazy in 10 years


Looks like a new Asus router.


Bad title. I doubt this is meant as a battlebot.


Everybody is gangster until it gets shotgun legs


That thing will get mauled.


That’ll get destroyed in the arena.


Flywheel bot. Done. Next.


Alright so this might actually be viable, but you’d need to completely revamp the legs to also be weapons, like maybe have a spinning saw blade or rotary drum or something on each leg then you gotta make the weapons adjustable because there are so many different sized bots, add in some armor and you’d be good, especially since it seems to already have the ability to self right itself which is extremely important but the points is based on damage so you’ve gotta have a way to have weapons on it, each leg being a pneumatic hammer would work pretty well but spinners are the favored meta these days, (I forget if it’s vertical or horizontal drum spinners), basically keep the computer and batteries safe add in some pneumatics or add really heavy things that spin really fast add armor and you’ve got what might actually be a meta changing bot on your hands


Until we have something wayyyyyy more energy dense than current batteries, these things are just going to be curiosities.


Spidertron 1000


Soon to be spare parts.


This patent belongs to the US military now ….replication is illegal


It's not walking.


Is really cool, but not a viable battle bot for most current competitions. Maybe somewhere someone has a leg only tournament.


The weapon to surpass Metal Gear


This would be really useful if all feet/limb ends opened


Won't last. Everyone knows hexagons are the bestagons


Battle bot can shake its booty


And still no walk cycle


What in the Mass Effect Geth tank


That thing's going to get trashed in Battlebots.


Niiiice


Imagine this being used as a weapon with guns, or other tools mounted on the top. Strategic bombers would drop swarms of these robots combined with drones to strategically eliminate the population and resistance forces of a city in the span of a few weeks. Then the infantry comes in to take the city.


*cuts wire* now what


Pretty sure I fought a really big one of these in the new Horizon dlc


I don't see it walking


Amaze!


I saw these on Stargate:SG1


That..is...epic


This was built by Mark Setrakian. He built Mechadon, the god of all battlebots.


WILD WILD WEST 

Wild wild west (when I roll into the)

Wild wild west (when I stroll into the)

Wild wild west (when I bounce into the)

Wild wild west


That's just a replicator from Stargate SG-1.


This is a great representation of the alien from the book Hail Mary


It's Rocky! Amaze amaze amaze.


Damn fine dog


r/titlegore


But where is the AI?


Reminds me of the Replicators from Stargate SG1


can I get a scaled up version of this with more legs that I can ride like a robot spiderhorse?


That has good potential for battle bots actually! Walking bots can weigh more due to their complexity!


Do you want Replicators? Cos that's how you get Replicators.


It might be entertaining to see a Simone Giertz bot go against this and the snake bot team (team sinister).


That’s not allowed in the house.


Needs Wifi


Can we turn this into Patrick?


It would be cool if it could attack in the folded up position. Then when it has immobilized the opponent, it walks over and stands on the defeated bot.


Beginning of a villain arc anyone?


Stop it.


Some played the Horizon series and got inspired. Hopefully they got bows and armor to deal with their creation


Well, I'm a badass Cowboy livin' in the Cowboy days.

when it first stood upright and formed a head, it looked a bit like Jimmy Butler.


Looks like an animation 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️


How epic 😎


It’s not a wedge it won’t win


fuck that


There should be "walker" and "flyer" categories for battlebots


Battle franky 39: Destroyer edition


Yeah, I watched Stargate SG-1. This could end up REALLY bad.


Well this takes me back to Mechadon and Snake.


r/OddlyTerrifying


It’s cool but if this is actually trying to compete in a battle it’s arena it’s going to get launched into next Tuesday


Now make it do the stick bug dance


They really gave it a “throw it back” feature


Rocky!


robot can do snake dance.


I got the moves like Jagger.....


Lovely


For Adun!!!


I busted


How does it hold up against chainsaws?


Someone better tell Spiderman...


That's so damn cool. Hope it doesn't have to fight a tiny M35 Mako though


You know it’s real when it looks fake.


Did someone say BattleBots? That's a golden nut, candidate.


Looks like an Evangelion angel


Cool robot, will get crushed by glorified angle grinder on wheels.


Its happening! The replicators have arrived!


I round battlebot with a ramp will destroy that


Would be cool if they had a tutorial on how to build one


Droideka next?


We lost


Anybody know what kind of actuators this thing is using? Just a general idea.


Imagine it has AI detection to bite your dick.


Well, just take my lunch Shards or Bottlecaps, whatever..


I could see a weapon incorporating a metal tube from which bullets, shells, or other missiles are propelled by explosive force, typically making a characteristic loud, sharp noise being incorporated behind each claw in the future


What’s it battling? Gravity?


r/OddlyTerrifying


**GETH**


Put a drone in the center so it can fly


This thing wouldnt last 5 seconds in the arena.


a 15lb robot weapon would destroy this thing, leg by leg

A 250lb one would not even need a weapon, just accelerate into it a bit and something would break


The whole time I was picturing a bot with a circular saw coming in and chopping those legs right off


This isn’t the battlebot lol. This is a hypothetical battlebot’s legs. Walker bots are given a 2x weight bonus. The challenge is making a walking system that doesn’t suck. In theory, if managed well, that leaves you an extra 250 pounds for solid metal armor or weapons or whatever else you want.


I don't think it was ever entered. I think the connection might be that one of the founders of battlebots built it?


maybe if you can make it super fast it can dodge everything like a ninja until the time runs out


they have a weird spider thing that rotates the trophy around on a table for the tv show, I wonder if that's it


Unless they introduce really uneven terrain.


**Walker Battlebot**: "I can precisely control 5 multi-axis jointed appendages, each featuring a pincer mechanism"

**Every other Battlebot**: "SPINNER GO BRRRRRRR"


Great Rich man table


the UK robot wars had one a bit like that called "Nut 2"


The Omnidroid


The problem is how'd it do damage. Rolling over another bot wouldn't do much, and the extending arms are still not very feasible.


This make me wish battlebots had a series with terrain that made wheeled robots unviable. Would be cool to watch 2 of these battle on a rocky terrain with different weapon attachments.


Tombstone would mutilate this in 2 seconds


Literally any horizontal spinner would fucking obliterate this bot in a second. All of those legs are just begging to be hit from the side and ripped off


Mark setrakian is a BattleBots fixture and built this concept. He has no intention of fighting anything with it.


[Son of Wyachi](https://battlebots.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SOW-Team-S2019.jpg) would eat his ass


I was gonna say, some of those drumbots would be like a pinball under the legs


This isn’t the battlebot lol. This is a hypothetical battlebot’s prototype legs. Walker bots are given a 2x weight bonus. The challenge is making a walking system that doesn’t suck. In theory, if managed well, that leaves you an extra 250 pounds for solid metal armor or weapons or whatever else you want. If you could build an inch thick titanium skirt all the way around this thing you could hit it with pretty much whatever you want. See: Chomp.


Don’t touch him, he’s HOT!!

I'll never forget the first footage I saw of bigdog. As if the T-100 wasn't terrifying enough.


Eh, this is a masters level meche robot. The math behind it really isn't that hard, and we don't even see it doing the hardest thing: locomotion


Rocky had three fingers on each hand though.


Indeed.


I knew this reminded me of something.


“You have consumed 14 beers in the last 127 minutes. Are you sure you would like another one?”


Do you want Replicators? Because that's how you get replicators.


Came here looking for this.


Indeed.


I was thinking, “is it doing a sexy little dance?”


It's not intended to be one. It was built and brought to the pits by one of the builders as a tech demo.


*replicator


Indeed.


It's not meant for combat itself iirc. One of the builders brought in their project as a cool demo.


My thoughts exactly. I haven't watched in like 15 years? I wonder if it's still the same basic formats or if there's been advances?

"Sorry boss I'm not feeling well today, I have to stay home and watch 18 hours of BattleBots. And research investment strategies in portfolios to build"


It was built by a former competitior as a proof of concept for a potential walking bot only competition, and it was showcased at the filming for the most recent season. So yeah, it isn't exactly meant for competing in the current show, but it is kinda meant to eventually fight.


Also it didn’t walk.


I wonder if you could put like a RamSet on each leg and just have it put it's foot down on each robot when they get close lol


Indeed.


Indeed


Indeed


Except one hit from an egg beater renders a leg useless.


Thats not surprising, considering this is made by the same guy that made those 2, Mark Setrakian.


jedi are no match for droidekas


As long as it blows up like “Moist Pony”, I’m good with that. https://youtu.be/D0T1247mi8Q


Is that because of more moving parts and lack of momentum vs. standard designs?


flipped and or pushed into the screws, hammer, or fire before it even stood up.


Would it last 5 seconds against you?


Walker only tournament


Maybe it can jump and then drill into other bots it lands on


Definitely agree. It would be obliterated in no time by a spinning pickle or something.

By the way, this is because battlebots arenas haven't evolved in the last twenty years. They're all flat and smooth, and the winning techniques are basically unchanged because of this and the winning criteria.

Nowadays technology has evolved quite a bit, and would be interesting to see proper automation in those kind of battles.


I'm imagining Claw Viper absolutely rocketing across the field with grabber out of the way and just bouncing the robot into the wall where it absolutely explodes


There used to be a few circular saw based bots - Sawblaze and Skorpios being 2 of them (not sure if there are more). Over time, the design was proven to be ineffective since circular saws just don't do damage to 250 lb robots, so they switched to "hammer saws" which are much beefier discs that spin at the end of an arm like a normal sawblade, but is brought down like a hammer instead of slowly with a sawblade. Sawblaze has been most effective with this strategy, to the point where they just won the championships.


I mean the saws aren't that good. it's been a long time since I've seen it, but they usually take long sustained damage. presumably this thing would just be moving around and the blade wouldn't maintain contact and it'd have to spin around. I just did a quick search for saw battlebots and they're mostly vertical blades. I think that would be harder but I'm not a a saw nor robot expert


This might be the context we need.  OP failed to deliver any info of accuracy or meaning


The problem is power.

Battlebots run on a weight limit system. 22lb - 55lb for lightweight, 56-109 for middle, 110-200lb for heavy.

Say you get the top of the line actuators, light metal frame, make it the fastest walker the world has ever seen, and at 55lbs! You know what's going to be faster on the flat ground of the battlebots arena? 40lbs of engine and wheels attached to 15lbs of spinning metal.

You'd need to make a whole new class of battlebot to make walkers viable. Rough, randomized terrain with lots of steep obstacles.


You can't just run away you need to fight. Its in the rules, if you don't engage you will be counted out. Otherwise it would just be two rc cars racing around a box for 3 minutes


No, that was designed by an artist. I believe Adam Savage did a Tested video on it a couple of years ago.


It’s kind of sad that the robot battle have degenerated to just a couple of basic types. There used to be so many different tactics, but now it’s just spinner/shredder inertia


The vindictive, spiteful, extremely powerful Omni droid


Well, I'd prefer the opposite. No obstacles whatsoever. Take out the little ledge, take out the saws, the hammers, all the stuff not attached to a robot.  No more 3 minute time limit.  Bash until beaten, with the operator having the option of throwing in the towel if they see too much damage being done.  There were a few fights this season that should have gone further, especially in the quarter finals of this year's tournament.  I think the results would have been changed if there was no judges' decision involved.


What a great idea. Watching the bot with the greatest spinning inertia drum win is getting tedious


[deleted]


Or imagine two bots fighting in moon-like dust, and it brings the additional challenge to keep the dust out of the internals


[deleted]


They said the end table, not my sister in law


Sorry.   It’s amazing as a bot


Then why does the title say battlebots demo?


You probably could but I think pneumatics like beta had would be much better for the robot imo


Didn't realize! Nice to see his work again!


I have never seen that before, thanks for sharing, 
It went from pony to cotton balls in an instant !


🤣 the commentary is hilarious


Ohhh shit that was satisfying to watch, thanks!


william osman, yes


r/AbruptChaos


To shreds, you say?


it's just super vulnerable.  

one whack from a spinning weapon and that thing would lose all its legs


The spinning bots in battlebots are just crazy. Heavy flywheels going very fast with tons of momentum would just shred this thing. Google some of these battles, as they are pretty amazing.


Lots of flimsy joints and bindings, you want as few rotors, joints, and fastenings as possible. The simplest design with the most effective motor weapon wins every time. That's why wedges and basic spinners are constantly champions


Yup weight allocated from armor and weapon to joints and actuators.  If it were quick and strong it could strategize picking up and using out of bounds and arena weapons.  But for the size and speed shown here that is doubtful.


What the vids you lazy fucker


>You'd need to make a whole new class of battlebot to make walkers viable. Rough, randomized terrain with lots of steep obstacles.

I've been thinking for a long time that Battlebots would greatly benefit from something like this.


Walkers are already not subject to the same weight and size limits.

 No one has taken advantage of it yet though afaik.


IIRC if your robot is a walker you can double the weight in order to make up for the fact that you have no wheels. So _theoretically_ you could top this thing out at 400 pounds.

The challenge would then be protecting the legs while still giving you the ability to do damage. If you just put a solid tungsten skirt or whatever around the legs, then you've effectively removed your ability to use your legs to deal damage. You'd need an upper skirt as well, in case you get flipped... although maybe not so much an issue if you're twice the weight of the other bot.

You could cover the legs in armor and put giant buzzsaws or kinetic drums on each leg, but you'd lose some of the things that makes this design nimble. You're also never going to beat a full-body spinner that can put everything it has into kinetic energy. Even if you put 200 lbs into some kinetic weapon of some kind, it's always going to be _really_ hard to beat a full-body spinner unless you can stop it early.

You could maybe use your legs to get over on top of it and then use a weapon underneath the legs to try and attack it from above? But that exposes you to a _lot_ of danger and it's going to be hard to prevent a spinner from just going for the inside of your leg.

Then again - some BattleBots aren't built to win, they're just built to look cool. This could just be a cool-looking BattleBot that doesn't have any intentions of taking home the trophy.


.... That does sound sick as hell tho


The guy who made the trophy holder also made this lol.


Probably because most other methods of achieving anywhere near similar power to weight ratios are considered too dangerous


Went to a live taping session for this year's season, all of the obstacles and things on the arena broke CONSTANTLY. There were guys out there after almost every match trying to fix shit.


I think the arena obstacles are garbage, but that's because they are generally weak as fuck and are only really a problem with getting stuck on them and letting the other guy wail on them. If those hammers came down with the blow of someone swinging a sledge hammer people would have to actually avoid them. Or if those flame jets were shooting out an oxy/acetylene cutting tip flame they would be an actual worry to drive over.


Let’s do it somewhere on the salt flats and remove all the projectile constraints. Battle mech vs battle mech with missiles and live ammo!


**THIS** is useless, just upvote


Tombstone is hella dominant, but I felt like it just got to a point where a lot of matches were just a gore show.


It was demonstrated on the TV show.

What's the one with the vertical spinning drum?

I'll never forget the first video I saw of that beast. I couldn't even figure out what was happening. Shit just going flying.


I wonder if the plan is to make this nimble enough to jump over other bots and attack them from behind?


This year's champion has quite a few moving parts in it, it's not just a simple spinner


Gimme that big Defensive lineman 1v1 everytime lol


Definitely still prototype- 

What about war of the worlds style tall robot?


Chomp mightve been the only one i think


From my spectator viewpoint, my favorite is the “flippers”


I understand the floor getting torn up because of some of the spinner weapons digging holes, but they really need to come up with a better alternative to rubber matting, since it causes problems for other bots later on.  Two or three times, I saw bots get their forks stuck in the holes other bots had made, or get stuck in the saw slots.  That's why I said get rid of the saws, since I've never seen a saw do any kind of significant damage since they've been introduced.  The hammers, I've seen do some damage, but they need to be completely automatic rather than controlled by one team or the other.  As for the flooring, either make it material that's easy to replace in sections or stuff that can be smoothed out with some kind of quick-set filler.


I would say even the screws along the edges are pretty pointless, since most of the time, they can't cut through armor, nor can they lift a bot out of the box either.  Might as well replace the screws with alternating grinder wheels running at high speed.  At least then, there's some kind of danger to it.  Then, at least, there's a danger of tearing parts off a bot that gets too close to the wall.


You...might want to look up White Sands, New Mexico.  The US military runs a lot of experimental weapons tests at the base there, and I think killer robots would qualify.  They did have one working prototype for an exo-skeleton frame for combat use.  Didn't get very far because it wasn't mobile enough, but the concept was pretty cool.  They have a pretty big test range, and it's not too far from Vegas.

I think there was one bot a few years ago that tried to qualify for Battlebots that used a projectile weapon, but they refused because they couldn't provide reliable armor for the sides of the box against the projectile.


I've said it for years, that Battlebots gets real interesting when they go this route. Move it out to the desert. Anything goes. No rules. No survivors.


THIS

>Tombstone is hella dominant

Not anymore unfortunately


I mean it was until people figured out how to strap a big chunk of angled metal onto their bot and win


Ah, that makes sense, I didn't watch the after show


Points are given in aggression as well as damage done. That would be an issue.

In addition, there is an active weapon requirement. Back in the early days, guys just drove armored wedges around and robot combat turned into a defensive game. It was insanely boring to watch.


Still can't do any damage tho, you have to fight in the box not just run away


"Hey freak show! I gotcha for three minutes!"


Controlled autonomously?

So you’re saying that if it was controlled by some super advanced AI that doesn’t exist and it was significantly faster than it is, then it would be good?

Yes, and if I had a billion dollars I would be rich.


There's lots of them.  Vertical spinners are probably half of the bots now.  What color was it?


Probably Minotaur, his fight against Blacksmith is the most-viewed Battlebots fight on YouTube. Check out Copperhead as well, another awesome brick of a robot with a terrifying drum.


It took Boston Robotics like 30+ years to make a robot that can reliably jump. Look how slow those servos are moving. This thing simply won’t have the mobility to jump. I’d be shocked if it could even walk from one end of the arena to the other in less than 15 seconds.


When the entirety of the opponent is spinning, which side is "behind"?


It takes a crapload of movement to get around to the other side of a bot and only a little bit to turn to face them as they move around you. Robots can spin on a dime, even if you could get a nimble robot like that to work at all, put it in the Battlebox and you're taking it home in a garbage bag. You can't just "attack from behind" in this sport without the opponent having already taken damage or without them making a mistake, which you can already capitalize on with a normal bot.


🤦‍♂️


There is a really tall roller called HUGE https://youtu.be/MgG8MjTRrec


Only with a ranged weapon with >=destructive power as the current weapons and decent fire rate. I don’t think battlebots allows for ranged weapons of that sort.


If you're talking about the floor, that's steel plating. There's no rubber mat as far as I'm aware.


Oof ouch I've been defeated


That’s for sure a big part of it, and to be honest a lot of why I watch! But I also enjoy other dimensions of the competition such as skillful driving that got deemphasized during the tombstone era.


So you couldnt legally compete as a robot spider that practices Ju Jitsu - lets say?


Could another robot pin an opponent long enough to win?


[deleted]


It kinda feels like this robot would (theoretically) be able to beat bigger opponents with a Ju Jitsu style vs. stand up brute force. 

Clearly I’m not a robots guy but i could see this thing working out in the future with good timing


“that's a cute outfit did your husband give it to you?”


Dunno, I think it was named toro or... something bull related? This was 5 years ago or so.


Yup it was Minotaur. Absolute beast.


What an ending 👏


My robot weighs 1 pound and the missile weighs 249 lbs lol


It's a layer of some kind of rubber over the floor, whether it's concrete or steel or whatever.  You can see when something digs into it.  If it was steel, there would be a lot more sparks and more damage to the weapons.


Please do everybody a favor and just watch one match on YouTube or something.

It’s destructive battle, not ju jitsu. These robots are driven like RC cars, they aren’t autonomous exhibition robots performing.

The goal isn’t to pin your opponent, it’s to leave them as a smoldering pile of metal shards and have their batteries explode.


Can only hold opponent for 10 seconds...it has to damage or disable the other robot..or hope the other bots commits self harm


No. My dude, you’re really throwing a lot of opinions out there and you really don’t seem to have any idea about what you’re commenting on.

If the legs could dismember another robot somehow then that would probably qualify, but I don’t know what kind of jiu jitsu you think can be used against a steel wedge with a buzz saw in the middle.

At best, you can disable its weapon. But, that’s not destroying it is it? That’s really just taking a match between one destructive bot and one non-destructive bot and turning into a match between two non-destructive bots.


I think you drastically underestimate the current crop of modern heavy weight BattleBots. 

It's not that this bot is just slow. It's not just that it doesn't have armor or a weapon. It also has a huge amount of possible points of failure. 

If even one of those joints is damaged or fails, it would be a drastic and quick decline in its mobility which would mean it would get blasted by whatever bot it's facing. 

With current materials and technology this is not a viable design for a battlebot facing the current crop of top-tier bots.


Have you ever watched any of these matches?

“Rip its guts out”?

Dude, its opponent is going to be a wedge encased in steel with a buzz saw sticking out. There’s nothing to rip out. There’s no grabby weakpoints on a lot of these things.

It’s like saying that it could put a metal cube in a choke hold.


Lol, how the hell would you control five independent legs, each with three multi-axis joints with an RC remote? These are driven remotely, not programmed.

Saying that you could just build and program a jumping wrestling spider is a hell of a lot easier than said. Same with “ripping their guts out”. Modern heavyweights are armored with thick plates of hardened steel bolted down, they aren’t as delicate as this spider thing.


Just hop on YouTube and watch any modern Battlebots fight, they’re essentially armored RC vehicles with insanely powerful spinners or flippers, not to mention 250lbs each. Nobody is doing robot karate, they are just driving their weapons into each other until the other one can’t move.

You can’t breakdance your way through a sledgehammer fight.


How would it? I don't see any weapons on it, and armor is really strong in battlebots


The Battlebots in question are bulky builds with variety of weaponry. Most of their mobile options include wheels and tractor treads. A walking battlebot has never made it far in the series because how difficult it is to make sturdy legs.

The fact that the joints have multidirectional movement makes it even more of an easy target.

Even the weakest battlebot could probably demolish this thing, due to the fact it requires power and locked joints to stand up. 

1 hit at its leg could knock the joints loose, or sever a power cord.


That would probably be Minotaur, and yes it's absolutely BRUTAL. 

https://youtu.be/ASfCdqqF4e8


Yup. Pretty much it.


Nope, it's 1/2 mild steel. Sparks are not required for metal-on-metal impacts and the weapons do actually have some pretty nasty chunks out of them after hitting the floor sometimes. They don't take a ton of damage from it because the energy in most of those collisions is often on the lower end, either from the hit that flipped the bot over to begin with, taking some of the weapon energy already, or just the fact that there's no edge to get a bit on to start transferring larger amounts of energy from.

From the Battlebot Wiki on the last major change to the floor:

>Following instances where the 2018 and 2019 arena floor became damaged by spinning weapons, the 2020 BattleBox received numerous updates to improve durability in this area. Key changes included a newer, thicker floor made out of 1/2" mild steel\[25\]\[26\] and a redesigned internal superstructure, both of which were implemented with substantial investment from Trey Roski himself.\[27\] This coincided with an aesthetic overhaul which included the addition of the current BattleBots logo in the center.


Hell yeah 🔥🤘


Thx for info! Cool sport hope it keeps getting bigger

I had always seen the destruction focus of Battle bots but i wasnt aware of the rule changes around wedge design etc and the boring nature of watching robots wrestle vs destruct lol


Somebody commented exactly what i was envisioning here below i think. It was just a thought experiment around the walker design becoming viable somehow lol :)

Do robot battles have “a strangle ability” like ju jitsu?


how many people can operate? Could you have 6+ people solely raising a spider leg to dodge? Im thinking war of worlds or maybe world war z


That's the one! Holy hell did that thing put on a show.


I honestly hate the two wheeled drum spinners, they're all the same and it's boring. I enjoy ones like Lock Jaw, Scorpios, whiplash, endgame, ghost rapter, hypershock, sawblaze, and whiplash. It's just more original design and it's fun to see what people do to solve flipping problems.


Chances of a drill damaging any of the bots is slim...even if the sat still for this bot...this bots legs would be destroyed before I could even try and use a drill, which might scratch paint at best!


[Okay, explain to me how it would compete against bots that can do this kind of damage to other 250 lb bots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=956U5YrhV2U) 

Some of those bots are SUPER fast and maneuverable. They are also blasting 250 lb bots 25 feet in the air, or 40-50 feet across the battle box. 

One hit, and that thing would be in shambles. It may have a viable design *one day*, but not at current at all.


Username checks out.


An example of what kind of brute force we’re talking about: https://youtu.be/a36EUVTn77M

The two in the video I linked are about as simple as they get, literally just wheels, spinning weapons, armor and control mechanisms.  The spinning bar weapon is 75lbs solid steel and spins at 250 miles per hour (400 kph).

A) There is literally no spider-bot design within weight limits whose legs could take the punishment of a spinning weapon to its legs.  Let’s say in theory the spider bot could somehow land squarely on top of it, it’d just get its legs broken.  For the other designs that show up, spider bot wouldn’t be allowed to “hold” (sit on top of) for the whole match.  It would have to “dismount.”  To do what you’re talking about (super fast/agile/controlled would require major corporation funding and the tech for it probably doesn’t even exist yet.

B) Battlebots does have a few safety rules in place like maximum weapon speed, not using explosives or using weapons like nets or chains to entangle. 

C) Demonstrating control or function is already a thing.  Battlebot becomes disabled they’re given a grace period to demonstrate movement/control.  If they can’t, they’re counted out.


Lol wut


Pretty much every combat robot competition has rules against entanglement devices like nets, rope, etc since they're just too easy to toss around and make fights boring and not fun for anyone. Kinda like how while bringing a sword to an MMA competition would defintiely let you beat your opponent easier, it also defeats the purpose of the competition in the first place, so it's against the rules.


Nope, you can grab but only hold for (I think) ten seconds, I forget how long. But you need to let go before you can grab again


I mean, for all we know, you CAN have 6+ operators, whether you want to or not is a completely different question. You don't link minds like a hive mind, communicating with 6+ people would be completely overwhelming. Most of the time 1 is enough, sometimes a weapon operator too, but you never see more than 2.


This season’s final episode just aired, you should watch it!


Lol most of those you names are very old bots 🤣

The biggest thing is anyone coming in needs to be competitive and able to survive.  And in the current meta for BB, vertical spinners dominate.  With the addition of the upper deck and tip speed limits, the meta of constantly escalating horizontal spinners was broken.  Horizonal was the logical next direction.  At some point they'll institute a change to disadvantage vertical spinners and a new meta will take shape.  But right now it's the verts that mostly rule the day.

What would happen if this dude and Steven Seagal got into a fight?


Love watching when these charlatans get into a "demo" against a real martial artist.


What does the fall guy get from this. Like is he paid or does he just want that "master's" approval that badly


So his shirt says Systema Tokyo and guess who he works for. Russian Federation ministry of Justice. He trains body guards 😂 His name is Mikhail Ryabko


I studied Chinese martial arts for a decent chunk of my life, and I have no fucking idea what I am looking at


Ehm..  we have a r/bullshido sub, you know.


Reminds me of pastors ‘healing people’. Literally no difference.


The real art is the spectators holding in their laughter.


It looks like he's fighting soccer players


"Magic Aikido". 

I got roped into a dojo years ago that had a sensei that did this crap. The other students taught real Aikido when he wasn't there, and when he was, he'd insist on using classtime for magically making his loyal u-ke fall all over themselves while he barely did anything. Then he'd act like he was Jesus...it was so ridiculous. To top it all off, he was a scumbag in real life, too.

Somehow, these simple, miniscule movements never work when students perform them. It's mysterious!


Steven Segal has really gone downhill.


Almost as deadly and dangerous as Steven Seagal.

I don't see anybody getting up and leaving. That may be a bigger facepalm.


This is a master class in how to avoid being thrown out of a Chinese All You Can Eat Buffet.


For those who don’t understand this style of martial arts: every time he is touched he lets out an ancient fart.


Ah yes - a grand master at bullshido


And this concludes our demonstrations in how to safely fall. As beginner students this will be your most important and first lesson. Big hand for jeremy for helping with my demonstration you can sit down for now. 

Now, what are the key fundamentals of falling? Thats right, protect the head, collapse in segments, and rolling is your friend. Rolling will help disperse the force of your fall which makes it all the more crucial to protect your head as whatever part of you hits last is most likely to take the most of the impact force. Lets all get up, pair off amd myself and the other instructors will be roaming around as we practice our first falls, straight backwards. Make sure to give yourselves enough room away from other pairs, spread out, we dont want anyone falling on each other


That guy falls really well.

I don't know any martial arts but I can kick this masters ass.


I heard he fingered a girl once and she died


How is no one laughing during this clown show.  I wouldn’t be able to not laugh


I can’t stop laughing at this!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

My god, more strength in his finger nail than my whole body. Lucky that guys not dead after that beating. NSFW


Ahhh, the formidable art of bullshito


This reminds me of when a preacher touches a sick person


Wow, Steven Segal looks awful.


Steven Seagal, is that you?


He inflicts cholesterol with the contact.

You know, I'm something of a martial artist myself


Clearly the cameras framerate is not fast enough to capture his movements


His belly fat is so THICK touching him forces you into his center of gravity, a twist of the wrist and the G-forces would tear you apart like a shirt on a broken washing machine. This master most struggle so hard to contain his field of gravity, such dedication


Whoa!... is he Steven Segal?


What's always shocking is these idiots have rooms actually being respectful.


Just like in the Matrix


But this is legit. I once went to shake this hand and he moved his hand so quickly that it created a hurricane and transported me to a hotel room on the other side of the country where I awoke with a headache and a sense of regret.


The force is strong in this one


Guy taught Steven Segal everything he knows.


Steven segall's master


It's a joke. The guy simply touch the arm or the shoulder and falls down? 😂😂


Aren't they just mocking these chinese "master"?


What’s the point of doing this? Is there a point at all?


Anyone dumb enough to give this guy time and money deserve what they get.

People in this thread have no concept of what chi is and how much force it has when harnessed by a master.


Ok so this is obviously incredibly stupid, but there is a modicum of real martial arts to learn here, if someone is coming to push you hard, if you redirect them a bit and move out of the way, it can leave them off balance. Something i was taught in karate class is the the best defense is to not be there. Works on every lvl, if you can stay out of a dangerous situation, you obviously aren't in danger, and if someone is throwing a punch, it'll always leave you less hurt if you make it miss. Rather than if you block. Even if you do get hit, stepping with the punch will extend the time of the impact which makes it have a lower force.

Edit: source: took karate class for like 10 years and had become an assistant instructor


That is Wimp-Lo. We taught him incorrectly as a joke


This has to be a troll video. No way this is legit.


Ahhh I feel the chi bullshito

It is clearly a joke, what is wrong with you people?


Was this dude trained by Steven Sagal on douchey pretend self defense and bad acting?


Why are people there watching this ?  None of them believe it’s real, you can tell by their facial expressions. (No excitement)


Send this guy to the front line


BOW TO YOUR SENSEI


How is no one laughing? I would be chuckling sitting over there watching this hilarity

Damn, dude is clearly a highly trained killer


Reminds me of when I “play karate” with little kids. 

Perhaps all his students are just humoring him?


This stuff should be illegal in all countries. This is not how you are able to protect yourself


Bullshido, I hate these people with a passion. Con artist that full of themselves and deceive others into their delusions or lies.


To put this into context. This guy is teaching something called Systema. A russian Martial Art, which is claimed to be in the tradition of the cossacs. I have had a few lessons, to see what this is about, and to be honest, I looks more silly than it actually is. The whole concept seems to be about dodging the opponents impuls, and giving a biomechanically impulse, that causes structures to be disoriented. On a basic level I found there to be some useful stuff, especially on how to minimize impact, when recieving a blow. What we see here ist just bs, but bs taken out of context.

and here I thought this *was* steven seagull without his hair dye!


My thoughts were strikingly similar, but I crafted this idea of a film that featured Steven Seagal attending the funeral of his great martial arts master (the guy in the bud) and getting wrapped up in a drug ring plot to find out that his deceased martial art master was alive and running the operation all along and using Steven Seagal to clear out his local competition while he worked at trying to investigate and stop the drug operation. In the end, they both would end up fighting with some of the most incredible shrugs and casual shuffles ever captured on film. Steven Seagal defeats the master and hooks up with his former martial arts master’s daughter and gets his usual uncomfortable romance scene before the credits roll.

OMG...WOULD LAST FOREVER!!!


The episode of Pokemon where both Metapods keep using Harden comes to mind


Let’s be honest, it’s probably one of Steven Seagal’s schools.


Sometimes Tai chi / Chi “masters” make this mistake, search it online folks, hilarious.


https://youtu.be/gEDaCIDvj6I

I like this one. As soon as the fighter realizes the "master" is full of shit he just grabs his gi and starts punching him in the face.


I'd love for them to do a "demo" on literally any random person on the street. You'd need someone you know who will feed into your bullshit for this to work


Them you should search for xu xiaodong. That legend takes on chinese martial art masters and beats them with his (self proclaimed) below average MMA skills.
He constantly gets punished for it by the chinese government but still continues


Check the sub r/bullshido for a laugh


[Totally Pointless TV](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8HiAZ1V9II7299tzelsadgyoMl_acYPD) has covered nearly everyone there's a video for on this and it's hilarious


Wait, they mean this seriously? I thought it’s a joke.


These techniques only work on soccer players


Wasn't there an amateur mma fighter somewhere in Asia that just went around challenging a bunch of these dudes and beating the shit out of them?


Okay I’ve done some GoogleFu and looked through the thread here for at least a few minutes and I still have no idea what’s going on here. Is this a whole thing?? What is happening?


I study martial arts and HATE people like this. Martial arts is quite effective, but you get clowns like this making videos that then causes the rest of the Internet to argue with you. So annoying.


Dont even have to be a martial artist. Just some dude would probably be enough lol


How about just anyone else in the room?  It’s the same guy over and over. It’s almost like it’s choreographed. 🙄


![gif](giphy|3ohjUOZ6zg2vT8kpZm)


The psychology that goes into this is actually pretty interesting,

As far as I can tell three biases go into this stuff, one is the conformity bias,

[Here's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) a link to a wiki about the Asch conformity experiments where they used conformity to gaslight people into believing that something that is clearly false is true,

It works the same as the indoctrination into one of these places, you walk into the room and it's full of these people who not only think qi or whatever is real but that they're using it on each other, most people won't conform but there are those more susceptible to social pressure,

Next is the [sunk cost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) fallacy, if they get you to come back and play along again you are more likely to actually end up believing that this stuff is real, even if at first you thought that you were just playing along, not only because of the social pressure from the other participants but also because the more time you have invested into this the less you will be willing to admit that you have been wasting your time,

And finally the authority bias, as [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) shows people will do some crazy shit if an authority figure tells them to, and since a martial arts instructor is an authority on martial arts you feel more inclined to go along with what they tell you to do even if it feels like it's silly and wouldn't work.

How these places are founded is pretty interesting too, pretty often these people start as real martial artists doing their best to teach people, but if their training partners are over compliment because they are the teacher they start buying their own hype, and believing that they can do things that they actually couldn't pull off against resisting opponents because their students aren't actually resisting, and if it keeps going eventually it can devolve into something like this, slowly turning a real gym into a joke, so a lot of these guys actually believe that what they're doing is real,

I used to have an MMA coach who whenever someone would let him do a technique without even really trying to resist would say something that roughly translates to "stop it or else I will start believing I have magic powers" which sums up how these places start pretty nicely,

So my money is on both dudes seen in the video actually believing that what they are doing is real

Mikhail died just about a week ago


I was wondering why people were in there watching this nonsense. They probably didn’t want to accidentally fall out of a window by calling his bull shit


I'm amazed that the Russians aren't absolutely owning the Ukranians in war with this powerhouse sharing his knowledge


He just died last month. Donated all his organs. It was offal. Too much gravy in the bloodstream apparently.


At first glance, I thought this was Philadelphia Collins showing off his gut & martial arts skills


Lol did he also train their army?


So that's why so many people are getting thrown out windows 🤔


>He trains body guards

Somebody jumps out of the crowd with a gun, about to assasinate putin. His bodyguards jump into action and...

Softly start tapping his shoulders. The bodyguards are amazed, this man can take on multiple chi masters at once. They help the assasin kill Putin, for only a man as powerfull as him can rule Russia. With his incredible power he quickly conquers thr world and crowns himsel god-emperor of mankind.

Its called Systema. Soviet-era martial art, supposedly used by Stalins bodyguards as a way to incapacitate threats as secretly as possible. If I remember correctly the guy in this video is some sorta gatekeeper of the martial art and has obviously mastered its ways.


Systema Training!!!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRzdZoEqrp4


It’s post Soviet systema. I think this guy is the son of the founder. 

Originally, it was just a mixed martial art, that emphasized leverage that only works in asymmetric fights and fire arm drills.

Now it’s whatever the fuck this is.


Beer belly and large titties?


This is Systema, Russian martial arts https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema, afaik. At least the instructor seems familiar.  I may be wrong.

That's a perfect analogy!

This is definitely the best comment here!!!!


Wait so this is a real thing people pretend they can do.?


Oh i thought the video was like a joke. You mean this is actually a thing


A bunch of students from different classes used to get together to cross train in our uni dojo. The class on before our booking was a bushido class. Their sensei wandered about carrying a katana on the street. He sneered at us all in different gear waiting patiently to let rip in the dojo. He used to make us wait half an hour past his class ending just to fuck with us. Being good students we would just chat and hang out til he was done meditating. After a few such encounters he waited behind while we were changing and tried to teach us “the fastest punch in the world” we were politely smiling at his crap demo and then thanked him and continued our conversation. Feeling rebuffed he challenged my friend to a contest to show his skills were superior. A bunch of our group were the head teachers in kickboxing, judo, ju jitsu, tae kwon do, shotokan and goju ryu. The guy he challenged was a brown belt in savate. He just shrugged it off but the bushido guy kept insisting. Eventually he said ok and so i said i would umpire. I set them up on the mat and called hajime. 

My mate Sion kicked bushido guy in the head with a light semi contact slap. Bushido guy said that he preferred full contact. My friends said let’s not.

Bushido guy charged him and ended up on his ass. He got angry as each time i correctly called out half or full points for Sion. Eventually bushido guy lost it and started with wild haymakers and Sion had to actually defend himself. He roundhoused bushido guy in the eye and flattened him. I called the win and we left the mat. Bushido guy fucked off with a black eye. He changed the time of his class so he never had to see us again.

The thing is - to be a martial artist - you have to accept and learn from defeat and humiliation as much as learning techniques. Every experience has something to teach you if you pay attention to it.


It really is bullshit.
In my experience scumbag in life is also an indicator of poor martial prowess. 
But aïkido is so deep. I think perhaps some of the most inner and subtle techniques in aïkido generate this feeling of magic, and perhaps people with a shallow practice fall into force shield bs.


But how do you go there as an attendee and think "Yup, this looks about right.  That's who I want to learn from."?

There was a Chinese fighter, can't remember his name but I think he was nicknamed the mad dog, and he lost all social credit cos he fought every 'master' of chinese martial arts and won handily.

Edit: his name is Xu Xiaodong


Oh my goodness I need to see it. Can you send me a link to start my rabbit-holing?

For the record, They are never masters.

Most real masters in Tai chi ch'üan (definitely not Thai) are also masters in Kung Fu. They would never be stupid enough to use Tai Chi in a fight because that's not what it's for. 

They also understand the philosophy very well, and will not be found 'showing off' on YouTube.


Link us your favorite


Welp I just went down a hour long rabbit hole


It’s sad because you can tell that guy has never even been hit in the face before. Anyone who has been in a fight is not going to stop in the middle of one and hold their boo boo like that.


I can't comprehend how one gets into this position. He must know that he can't fight. He twirls his fingers and people 10 feet away fall down. He knows he's not really doing that, right? How do you agree to a public fight with anyone?


Yeah. You can tell that getting hit is just straight up novel to this guy, and since it's so easy hitting him, I think it's safe to say he hasn't been in a real fight in a long time if at all.


I absolutely do not understand why their students play along. Or are they only allowed to be students *if* they agree to play along?

I'm so confused about how this is such a widespread thing. Like, I've seen this nonsense in the goddamn Midwest of the US, where actual blue collar white guys are falling over themselves because their sensei exhaled kind of loudly. 

Wtf is going on?!

On a similar joke, you can measure the rate of "miracles" in Lourdes water. The spring let out about 20-40 liters per minutes, and in 165 years there have been 70 official miracles according to catholic church.

 So that's a max of 40 nanomiracles per liter, or 150 nanomiracles per us gallon if you prefer.

On the other side, 6 millions pilgrims visit the sanctuary each year (80% are from France, Spain and Italy).
Given the average distances travelled and death rates of cars/trains/airplanes per km it's easy to show that the pilgrimage is killing a LOT more people than it heals , statistically.


Yes

There are people that ***really*** pretend they can basically use the Force from Star Wars

And the worse part is there are people that believe it

It turned out that the most useful thing I learned from my aikido experiences wasn't the actual hands-on techniques so much as getting comfortable with relaxing into the momentum and tucking and rolling. It saved my neck the time when I accidentally hit a curb on my bicycle and flipped over the handlebars.

Poor guy needs to pack up his family and go to Taiwan or something, I saw that video Count Dankula made on him.


Ya I remember that. Because of his shitty social score he had to do like an 18hrs maybe more or less but it was ridiculous, to go fight one of these “master”… destroyed the guy in minutes


Damn, he sounds thoroughly tired of his country’s bullshit and willing to deal with the consequences of making it known. Sounds like a really rough time, but he still stuck with it anyway. Dedicated man, there.

Edit: Like seriously, they fucked up his life by making him unable to rent or own a home, unable to fly or take a train, unable to get a loan, made him pay $40k worth and make a public apology and then the motherfucker gets up and does it again. That’s like one of the most civilly disobedient middle fingers I’ve seen given in the modern day.


Google some of Xiao Xiaodong's fights. He's an infamous Chinese mixed martial artist who has made a career (and ruined his reputation in China) out of challenging bullshido "masters."


I added 3 links to the first dude that responded, check it out. There are millions of these videos due to the prevalence of Thai chi as a workout / “spiritual” activity, the “chi” is where shit gets crazy, that’s the Jedi no touch shenanigans.

I had the same thought. You could tell he had never experienced that before.


My only guess is people have been falling for his bullshit for so long he started believing in it himself. Mass delusions or something.


He knows its bullshit, but right before the fight he thinks, "but what if"


I think it must be like how I felt when I learned that a big garbage bag does not act like a parachute when you jump out of a tree.


Yeah, this is the great unsolved mystery for me. 

* If it's all a grift and both the master and the students are in on it, then why would he accept a real fight? 
* If he believes it's real, then his students are performing for his benefit. Whose job is it to instruct the students to take a dive? And who would be a student at a school where you have to let the master pretend he's using magic powers on you? And why would any of his enablers *allow him to take the fight*?

There's just no clear reason these guys should ever end up in a real fight.


Religion would fall under that category, yes, but it’s clearly not exclusive and the same way not every gym/martial artist is wack the same goes for religious practitioners (at least for the level of self-illusionmeant here)


No, religion sometimes ends up helping people. 

Of course, sometimes is too little for an organization based on morality, but we must remember it can always go to worse.


"Colonel Mikhail Ryabko has vowed only to use his martial arts in critical situations, rather using good humour and a friendly smile to defuse any volatile situation he may encounter. Turning other peoples aggression into magnanimity just from a few well chosen words"

I wonder why 🤣

For instance, how he got this position in the first place


The ultimate fighting technique mastered by Colonel Mikhail Ryabko is the ability to convert evil into good, and thereby saving his soul and the souls of the people he had saved from engaging him in combat.

He saves their souls from facing the combat loaf.

I worked for a well known Chi organization as their COO. I’m good at marketing and PR, needed a job and didn’t research Chi thoroughly. I quit because Chi is a con, lying to folks about what is possible, I felt the founder knew too, was a snake oil salesmen, preying on the naive.

Contrary to all those other things apparently he'd been a deputy for 2 decades. So that doesn't belong in this list on account of being actually true


Poor guy. He wanna expose the bullshit that China "kungfu master" is but due to the chinese government is protecting all these "kungfu", he got a bad rep. He still can fight, but gotta wear some silly mask or paint his face and he cannot go by his name to fight. Also his credit score is so damn low that he cant even use public transportation like train and bus.


Not just bullshido master like this guy, he meant to expose the ineffectiveness of all current chinese martial arts, which includes a lot of kungfu who always claim their art is “to dangerous to spar” with, he stepped on a lot of toes.


The bullshido masters said that if he wanted to fight them he had to do it in clown make up. He did and beat the shit out of them


I'm so excited for bedtime doom scrolling later


Those poor people. Not the instructors, the "students" I guess? So dumb but I bet they just want to believe in something bigger than themselves. Oh well.


That guy in the second video went around China beating the crap out of "masters" and was ostracized by everyone because he was basically proving that these respected members of the community were frauds and no one wanted to believe it.

This is a video about it. https://youtu.be/uvq-2_5MdOs

Honestly I get through it by imagining he’s in a global cosplay-LARP. Or thinks he is. In that case, you go little sifu, you go.

Wish there was a video of him actually shitting his pants after he challenged a stunt man that he could get out of a choke hold and passing out and shitting himself when he couldn’t.


Yeah, he is a citizen patrol guy, not a licensed peace officer. There is a website to see every person licensed as a peace officer in the US, and several media groups have already exposed that Segal has never been licensed.


Oh and don’t forget he is a “good friend” of Vladimir Putin: “Seagal remained involved in back-channel discussions between the US and Russia. In 2013, Seagal accompanied an American congressional delegation to Russia following the Boston Marathon bombings. According to one of the congressmen present on the trip, Seagal “opened up some doors” for the group while in Russia.

Seagal would go on to become a full-fledged Kremlin propagandist over the coming year. He publicly defended Putin’s annexation of Crimea, referring to his policies as “very reasonable.” He also played at a concert for pro-Russian separatists in the Crimean peninsula following its annexation.

As a result of his loyalty to Putin, Seagal was rewarded with Russian citizenship in November 2016.”


Is that last sentence a joke, or do they actually check your credit score before you get on a bus in China?


I remember learning about him a long time ago. How is he able to still put up to this? He legit doesn't quit


This is a common issue overall right now actually. It used to be that if you studied a martial art that's what you stuck to and you got good at *that* martial art. Some of them had a valid historical use but over time became ritualized and rigid. This made them only good in one particular context which was ultimately fighting itself. Part of the idea of ultimate fighting in particular was to see which martial art was best. Bruce Lee was also criticized for studying more than one as that kind of "broke the rules" as it were.

It turns out that most martial arts are 100% useless in actual real world situations. This then led to the mixed martial arts we see now where fighters tend to study multiple fighting styles then use whichever bits are appropriate when they're appropriate.

Then you have Krav Maga. Krav Maga is meant for one thing; being absolutely fucking deadly. It was purpose built for winning fights at all costs in the worst situations as quickly as possible and that's it.


I think his credit score become so low that he cannot use any of the public transport like train, airplane or apply for a loan


Beautiful. 👍🏼


Yeah, working out is wonderful, but they should be elsewhere imo, learning real martial arts. If they are simply into spirituality, find another outlet that isn’t regularly disproven.

China has a credit score system called zhengxin, but the idea of the “social credit score”is largely a myth built on the actions of one [small city](https://amp.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3205829/how-chinas-social-credit-system-actually-works-its-probably-not-how-you-think)


I did a bunch of Kung fu for years then went to a kickboxing class and fucking loved it , it removed all the shit and impractical crap but still had that awesome flair feeling !


I've done some kung fu when younger. But the instructor was a bit of a lad, lots of missing teeth, was from a really rough area and had been in plenty of street fights. He taught a modified version of kung fu, his own style kind of like Bruce Lee made his own thing. He didn't believe in all the bullshit but would teach part boxing type head and feet movement, with some influences from kung fu for the speed and various strikes to the throat, eyes and various points on the body/face. He used to go and train in China and could do all the flashy crazy kicks and things if he wanted, but he would make it very clear what was useless in an actual fight. Was a huge focus on full contact sparring too which was basically get on gloves and shin pads and kick fuck out of each other but using some of the principles of kung fu. 

I always think of him when I see some of this bullshit kung fu / tai chi / aikido type stuff


I was with you until krav maga... there might be a handful of decent instructors out there (like 0.1%) but it has just as many charlatans and fantasists as kung fu.

From 25+ years of martial arts study, I can tell you the only one that is unequivocally effective is MMA (or cross train in a good grappling art such as wrestling/BJJ/judo and a good striking art such as muay thai/boxing/kickboxing).

Any martial art that doesn't involve a massive proportion of live sparring in their training is probably bullshit.


Krav maga has just as many mcdojos as the rest of them. In any case it's a mixed martial art in and of itself, jack of all trades.

All the "effective" martial arts - boxing, muay thai, bjj, wrestling, judo etc have a couple of major things in common. 

They all utilise realistic free-style sparring as a key component of training. They also are VERY intense and taxing on the cardiovascular system. This is the key.

That is even better than the rumour he(seagull) was mouthing off about how he could beat up Van Damme, back in the day, then shat it from fighting him while at a Stallone party in the 90’s.*

I’d have paid money to watch JCVD kick his ass back then and I’d pay a hell of a lot more, to see it done today.

Edit: He instead made his excuses and left shorty afterwards.

From your link:

>There is no clear evidence as yet of this system being abused to enable widespread social control, though it does remain possible that it could be wielded to restrict individual rights.

No "widespread" social control, that we have "clear evidence" for .... yet.  So many wiggle words.


I knew a kung fu instructor who also learned how to do all the jumping spinning kicks stuff - he learnt because he thought it looked cool, was fun to do... but made it very clear he wasn't going to teach any of that in his self defence class.


Agree. Krav maga is filled with these kind of charlatans too. Most of them say their art is "too deadly" to spar with. Re your last sentence, its not probably but definitely for sure


I'll certainly concede that there are a lot of Krav Maga McDojos that actually don't know what the hell they're talking about.


This is just my anecdotal observation, but there is something about KravMaga that attracts the most aggressively un-atheltic people ever.  It's like there is subliminal advertising embedded in it that goes "Can't do a single pushup?  This martial art is for you!"


This 100%. Most people don’t know how important live sparring is until they’re feeling like they’re being drowned.


I recently watched a [video](https://youtu.be/-oLm1YNIB-o) where Norwegian climber Magnus Midtbø tried BJJ and it looked pretty legit, like the type of sport i might be interested in myself. I really like that it isn't just about violence and ending up in court claiming self defense but rather a realistic way to subdue someone without hurting them.


I was gonna say the same thing. A lot of krav maga thats taught is “works on paper, not in practice.” Sure, twisting someones wrist to disarm them *would* work. In a demonstration. But in real life when adrenaline kicks in, the other person is trying to avoid being touched by you, tensions are high, etc? You’re getting shot before you can do anything. 

Also, the “too deadly to spar with” thing is such bullshit. All legitimate martial arts can be deadly if done in the street. Human beings are fragile. If you punch someone in the face, they might crack their head on the concrete and die. If you get punched in the face, same thing. If you put someone in an RNC for too long you’ll kill them. If you get suplexed onto the concrete, guess what. Take a kick to the dome? Good luck. 

Then again, i could feel this way because “my martial art is the best/most practical martial art” lol


Nothing like sparring to make you realize REALLY quickly how bad you actually are!


Crapoeira


Krav Mcnaw


He shat himself when he got choked out by a fight choreographer. He ran from JCVD who went on a cocaine fueled rampage from party to party trying to track him down but unfortunately JCVD was unsuccessful.


Never forget the lie he propagated;

"Seagal would win because he is actually a black belt, and Van Damme only learned martial arts for his movie roles."

In reality, Seagal is a black belt in a useless martial art because, during his demonstration, the judge fell asleep and gave him the black belt as an apology. Van Damme studied shotokan karate, kickboxing, and ballet (still more of a martial art than the version of aikido Seagal "teaches") and won the (team) European Karate Championship as part of the Dutch national team in 1979


I mean “clear evidence” is pretty important to me if I’m supposed to believe something that sounds so weird.


I mean I’m not defending the Chinese government and I could have found a better source but the idea of a giant system that tracks and scores a billion peoples lives isn’t realistic. It’s very possible that the person mentioned is blacklisted from public services but it’s not tied to a “credit score”


I was going to one in Toronto that had a full contact class and they meant it.   I hadn't been training long enough there and hadn't been cleared for the class, but it looked absolutely brutal.


It's like the "I can do yoga" crowd but for violence.


I admittedly only practiced BJJ for a year, but that year taught me some great stuff. What i learned from actually sparring or "rolling" with other students was it teaches you to fight your instincts a bit. When I first got choked out, I instinctively began to struggle and did not calculate my movements, so this made it easier for my opponent to just readjust while I was struggling and then get me to tap out. Once I became accustomed to being put in a hold, I learned to slow down my motion, fight the panic instinct, and calculate where I would move my arms or legs deliberately to help leverage myself out of the situation or protect my neck further to avoid getting choked out. Only way to learn that is to actually "fight" your opponent.

Sorry, allow me to explain! 

“Shat it”, would be past tense of, “shit it”, which is a turn of phrase where I live, it means to be scared or, terrified of something, I did not mean he literally shat himself, not the JCVD time anyway, maybe he did later but, that wasn’t part of the rumour and I wasn’t saying it was, although it should be.

Apologies for causing the misunderstanding!


Oh I know, was a bit of a Jean Claude fan, JCVD would have ruined him then and would ruin him now as would Van Damme’s daughter.

No respect for Seagal in anyway.


Thank you, the world seriously needs more people with that attitude.

The nose powder while she says your attacker is now in the infirmary 🤣


And the accent is wonderful while you’re slapping someone around


1920s/30s


Part of me wants to laugh because I know a lot of that won't work on a resisting attacker, but damn if her throws don't look super crisp. I can't hate on that.


Definitely earlier than the 1960s.


Why the fuck do they always get the wrong dates in these posts? This is one is decades off.


The little "Oh my" gesture when she face planted him...


That man got abused for probably 2$


Love her composure and femininity while kicking ass !


This video is between 1937-1947. Definitely not 1967.


She throws him around so politely and with such eloquence, like getting Elocution lessons, and grammar lessons from a slim female version of Steven Seagal.

![gif](giphy|gfCAPpeargylYyYdxx)


1930s not 1967

![gif](giphy|YporP8X437C4U)


Maybe 1947 those clothes are not 1967


The third move is the Judo throw Tomoe nage. The fifth is also a Judo throw but I don't remember what its called.


This is not 1967.. more like 1937.


1967?!? Try 1937.


What if he comes at you with a banana?


1967?!  More like 1927.  Grainy film, weak audio fidelity, the outfits and her accent all suggest this is before world war II.


My wife took a model mugging self defense class.  It's full impact (instructor wearing a heavy padded suit, martial arts guy who knows how to roll).

One of the women in the class was 5'2", and her husband said it was all a joke. He was a bit of an ass. He hid and grabbed his wife as she unlocked the front door to prove his point. He ended up in the hospital with broken fingers, tendon damage, and a cracked skull from hitting the porch. She was mortified, but adrenaline and the proper training were one hell of a combo.

Your VOICE is your first line of action. Run, Hide, get the hell away from the person. If you have to fight, full impact, bite as hard as possible, but FIGHT! Never be complacent, make a scene, and fight as hard as possible. 

I had a great instructor for my Parkinson's Boxing Classes. She was a MMA fighter and taught MMA classes before our class.  I learned why guys painted their toenails! She was a badass, but a wonderful instructor.


The body mechanics are right and ultimately this stuff matches with things dating back to medieval manuals and older (when it was unwritten).

The main issue is that you need insane amounts of training to pull this shit correctly in live. Like hundreds to thousands hours, can't just take a couple lessons, need a lot of conditioning & physical training


Looks classic Aikido to me.


This is actually fucking legit and that sumi was crispy. Someone who doesn't roll out will go face first


1967? That looks 10 or 20 years older than that


I am amused that someone actually thought this was the late 1960s during the midst of hippie anti-war subculture of the Vietnam War.


I think people forget that this isn't a how to video like people look for in modern days. This is just trying to sell classes to ladies. So I don't think the criticisms are that valid as you'd be able to find which moves are most practical while training


You go girl!


WAAAAAYYYYYY off on the year.   By decades.


I don't know you ! That's my purse !


Fun fact, safety mats were invented in 1968


It's also interesting that Jujitsu was brought to the UK by a husband and wife active in the suffragette movement


I need to teach my daughters this.


that looks more like 1927 haha


When I was in 3rd or 4th grade a kid ran at me on the playground intending to tackle me.  For some reason my brain told me to grab his shoulders, roll back and put my foot to his chest when he dove.  I  did, and he went through the air and landed square on his back.  I rolled up and he just laid there for a few minutes, got up, and told me he didn't know what happened, but we're ok now.


bro they hitting this dude for real


Taking ukemi on hardwood floors? Fuckin tough


Distinct TransAtlantic dialect there.  Timeline is more likely late '30s - Early '40s.

The clothes and lack of color photography aren't '60s either.


this is my grandmother ! I swear it's true . Miss May married a "rich turk " according to the newspapers at the time and moved to Turkey . she gave birth to 3 kids , one of them my father ..  she was a lovely person , very dignified and she exercised daily until well into her 80s.. rip ..


With this outfit and audio quality this more looks like 1937, not 1967.


1937….maybe


More like 1937.


The transatlantic accent


That was filmed in 1967?  It looks more like 1927.


Some of these moves have potential; some are even classic judo. 

But teaching it in this way; as if its an effortless games of checkers that won't ruffle your hair is dangerous as hell. 

If one fights back from a stronger attacker, one does it with every ounce of strength speed and fury one has. You're being attacked, not slightly inconvenienced.


This self-defense stuff is tough to watch. It really hasn't changed much since then, and women believe that these tricks will actually help them in a real-life situation. You are not putting a man looking to do you harm into some armbar when he has you by the throat.
The best tip is to go for the nuts and run as fast as you can towards a public space. Pepper spray and a taser are always good to have as well.


Definitely 30s.


To all the big bad martial artists who were criticizing her form, remember that she is doing a demonstration video.

For those of the people who aren't big bad martial artists, most of these techniques are perfectly affective and she could easily have dislocated his elbow with a couple of these moves.


This is pretty cool but i feel bad for any women who took this seriously because alot of it is just not going to work on an attacker. I always thought the best advice was to run and that goes for both genders because real life isn't a hollywood movie.


The early days of bullshido


Demo in a dress, props for that!


Well, I definitely wouldn’t attack her. She’s pretty good at a takedown.


More like 1937.


If you had said 1947 I would’ve believed you. No one was dressed like that in the late 1960s…


Nice.  She can't contain how much joy she gets throwing that guy around.


I love her classic accent.


A little bit hokey but I love it. You’ve got a 50/50 chance of these moves actually working but hey it’s better than nothing.


this is not in the 60's its more late 30's or 40's or 50's judging by their clothing and the way she talks.


THAT'S MY PURSE! I DON'T KNOW YOU!


Immediately start kicking him in the genitals as hard as possible, also attempt to shove your fingers in this eyes, scratch his face, punch his throat. Basically just try not to panic (too much) and be really really aggressive.


In heels, dude 😂


The year is wrong , it was from 1933 ( I had seen the video before )


Standard judo/jujitsu/aikido techniques.


She needs to throw in a little Kenpo


I think I'm in love


That's my purse! I don't know you!


Reminds me of Steven Seagal showing his aikido moves.


These can all work after some training, but how about the inner foot arch stomp or a kick or knee to the plums? Also, elbows work better than grips when moving out of some holds :)


Apparently this is actually from the 1930s, which absolutely boggled my mind because the video quality is like... 2010s quality.


I love this. She's so cheerful and feminine despite throwing this guy around.

The sort of grandma who dotes on her grandkids but wouldn't tolerate them messing around.


Don't touch my purse! 
Then kick them in the nuts


That’s my purse, I don’t know you


That was a nice Tomoe-nage


Those are legit judo/jujitsu techniques


Why are the impacts so fucking loud lmao


This is SO entertaining.  She is so polite and bodying him. 

&#x200B;

" I place one foot in his tummy..."  BLAMM  


"Simply twist his wrist and plunge... " WHACK


I really think the UFC would be improved if they made all of the fighters and announcers use this accent and dialect.


“Stay down you cad or you shall feel the back of my hand once more!”


The guy looks like a young Richard Nixon


At the absolute least, it's something resembling actual Judo techniques that she's demonstrating. She has Kihon and Kata, but a proper class needs Kumite.


that’s my purse, i don’t know you


no way!! never thought i'd see my great grandmother on reddit. this is super cool!


Try 1937!


Cool video. These classes are kind of useless though. Unless you regularly practice these moves against a resisting opponent you will never be able to pull them off in a real situation.


Now perform that on a drugged out dude.  Scariest thing I've ever seen was police trying to take down a man who was completely gone on PCP.  Tasers, pepper spray, body blows.  The dude was a tank.  It took four **large** men to hold him down long enough to secure him.  It took twice as many to restrain him on a gurney.


No amount of technique can out match an asshole on PCP or Meth.


These courses are so dangerous to teach to teenagers.  They get one class without the hours upon hours required to master these defensive moves.  Then with inflated confidence, they are more likely to put themselves in dangerous situations.

They need to be taught to break noses, kick balls, scream for help, and run like hell.


Wwow.. the sound he is making is real pain..


1947


No one dressed like that in 1967.


that was filmed back when talkies were new. Like mid to late '30s.


There's no way that this is 1967. Def 30s.


![gif](giphy|cpBJJODbvE03S|downsized)


Definitely not 1967, maybe 1937 or 47...


More like 1937


This isn’t from the 1960s. Just the frame rate on the film says it’s at least 30 years older


Ju Jutsu truly is great for women to learn. I've had my ass whooped plenty of times in my class by women


The attacker looks like a young Richard Nixon.


Y'all calling this "bullshido" are weird. These are legit Judo techniques. Waki gatame, tomoe nage, and seio nage. They are all usable against a resisting opponent in free sparring. Of course I'd avoid tomoe nage (the sacrifice throw) on a hard floor because it'll hurt in the morning, but it's still a valid technique. Yes, you need to train these techniques to use them effectively, but that's true for literally any martial arts technique.


Maybe 1867. But more like 1945 or so?


Love that the attacker is even in a suit.  Girl is also using a lot of judo, which tends to work even better against someone is a suit, as it is very similar to a judo gi.  And she takes a break to fix her makeup :P


Yes and no.  Yes in it's core the techniques work.  It's basic judo, with the last technique being a tomoe nage.  However anyone who's ever done randori will understand the grips and setup she's using are complete trash and unless you've trained a lot you won't have the fundamentals of kuzushi and grips required to pull the moves off.  Nobody grabs you like that in a real confrontation.  Any grip will be followed by a pull or push resulting in the victim being thrown off balance.

I almost feel like it's dangerous to teach women's self defense in single class or presentation style because unless they understand and train with resisting opponents it gives them a false sense of confidence when dealing with bigger, stronger and very dangerous opponents.

As someone who rolls with bigger stronger trained and untrained people on a daily basis and teaches kids, I see what it looks like when I put a smaller kid with a bigger kid.  It's not pretty even when the smaller kid is more technically sound.


Is this Steven Seagal's sister?


No offense, but none of those moves are likely to work. Looks a lot like some Steven Seagal shit, which has been proven to be total BS.


Protect your holes


Hate these videos. They never show us how to keep the attackers in a stasis effect.


Those are some pretty good moves if your assailant is a toddler.


Its not that these can't be effective, its mostly Judo. Its that it takes *years* of practice to pull it off on a non-compliant attacker.

At any rate #1 rule is that 9 out of 10 fights in public quickly ends up on the ground where the heavier person has a tremendous advantage.


Ladies... this will not work for you. The best thing you can do is run and yell for help. Men are much stronger physically and they can easily overpower you, don't fall for videos like these, it could cost you your life.


Telling women that they can defend themselves against a grown man in a hand to hand altercation is extremely irresponsible.


These are judo moves. And they work and the principles are still teach today in self defense. But they required training.  Not as easy to do for an untrained individual against an opponent offering resistance.


The most feared attacker in the Universe.  The one that uses a single attack, commits to it, and stops in a frozen position.


All that effort instead of simply just learning how to not burn the pot roast.


Throat punch, eye gauge and ball kicks are all you need friends


Not much changed. A lot of self defence classes still look like this


Seems I mistakenly thought I was going to be one of the first people to comment it looked like it was from the 1930s and then noticed a lot of others thought the same thing and it was subsequently claimed to actually be from 1933. 

For the other folks who could easily identify the proper age of the clip, are you all fans of old movies also, or just really old, LOL?

For the people who thought it was from the 1950s or 1960s, have you never seen old movies or old rerun TV shows from those times, or are you all 12?


if this only worked in real life...


Er, no,  won't work.  
I have female friends that have a false sense of security because they went to self defence classes. Even as a man I know that my best defence is to avoid getting into those situations by being accompanied or simply running away from trouble, or potential trouble. And that, my dudes, is also what Special Forces advise.


The same useless techniques that self-defense 'masters' have  been peddling to women for years.


I like how polite he is, mostly using just one hand to grab her, never trying to initiate untoward bodily contact. Men were real gentleman, back then - even muggers and rapists respected a woman’s physical boundaries!


A man would down her in half a second, but I guess Hollywood has loved to pretend women can do this since the 40’s.


Yes, she is my husband's grand mother and video taken around 1930 few years earlier maybe.


Follow this self defence video and you're getting raped or murdered I'm afraid.


Don't try this shit it won't work


How 🤔 are you


[deleted]


Very effective against a one-armed man with the strength of a child.


It's not very effective..


Wonder how many tried this only to realise it never works


Bring gun use gun then none of this shit matters


Loving all the debate on her form and the effectiveness of this move. Reality is that it does work, but her best course of action would have been a very hard and swift kick to the balls or fingers jabbed in the eyes.


I wonder how many women were harmed because they believed any ounce of this would actually work?


It’s a fake video 🤦‍♂️


Ladies don't try that in real life, in not an expert but i don't think the attacker will wait for you to make those moves and then roll over to the ground.


Yes, disarm your assailant by turning to the nearest camera and narrating.  Gives you the upper hand every time!


Looks like Hapkido?


u/savevideo


1967?  dont think so


And even on heels, motherf*cker.


That arm bar was vicious. I’m amazed the perp did not get his arm broken, and wrist, and elbow…


Just imagining the coiled muscular structure on women of the greatest generation; I have no doubt about her quickness and power.


Poor dude.
Taking it like a champ with no mat or polsters.


Master Ken's Grandmother!


Why doesn't this dame have a man to protect her? Is she some kind of spinster or something?


1967?  He hair style, shoes, and suit look more like 1947.


Off by at least 30 years.


I ignore all no I learned, I kick him in the crouch


Her throws remind me Ken from Street Fighter II


That last one is quite naughty


The inside trip works well,  providing you have a fast outside single,  I use it all the time.


Looks to be more like the 1930’s tho


Today in "Hedda Hopper Kicks your Ass"


OP needs to watch more old movies from the 1930s.  BTW, the precode era is a mind blower.


The look of anguish on the man as the demonstration continues.


I’ll venture to guess this is a little older than 1967.


Somethings never change


Most of this is Aikido


_And at this juncture I proceed to rain hellbows._


This is the 1930s


![gif](giphy|xUPGcfe7OAEDKUXQPK|downsized)


She learned from Tarzan on her expedition


That looks quite a bit older than 1967


What is that accent?  That's always bugged me about old timey videos.  Also, "Damn girl, ever heard of half speed for training?"


In my squeeky 1920's voice I will now demonstrate how to get my ass kicked.


“When was this done? Shit, I dunno. 1822. Yeah.”


1967?? More like 1937


I know these are unrealistic but I am very attracted to her right now


Don't you mean 1937?


Kick his balls!


Little-known fact: these 1960s hippies got their name because of their hip throws.


My wife just carries a gun.


Wow I’m impressed! She’s so good I’d have her be MY bodyguard!


She forgot to discombobulate him first


Damn She’s beating his ass


Or you could "GOUGE HIS EYES!!"


Some of these work, except for the last two. The first one has a very low likelihood of success too.


Ladies, if a guy grabs you around the neck, don't lean back and throw him, hoof him in the dick.


Its all Judo


It only works if you practice it.


Same, format for self- defense. It was entertaining.


![gif](giphy|xUPGcfe7OAEDKUXQPK|downsized)


Looks more like ‘47


Survival rate?


Wow you are a bad guess of decades, OP.    
30+ years off.


1967 my ass


The impact noises sound like gunshots.


this woman has a better chance of escaping an attacker than those fuckin dunces out of DUST in Detroit lmao


Jeez Katy Perry has been around longer than I realised.


Women traded this accent for Upspeak.


Wow that is essentially martial arts I learned, I did Kung Jung Mu Sul for years, a lot like Judo and joint breaking. If you get the wrist, break it, elbows too ladies!


Just kick the balls ladies


Clothes look like 1947.


I like her style, she’s a keeper. She makes me feel all funny…


The original title was actually "A Ladies Defense Against The I-Talian Menace"

That dude is really selling it though.


She looks cute and badass at the same time. Probably not the ideal reaction to this video.


Break the wrist… and walk away.


Isn't this just judo or something?


All my ol’ favorite Judo hits packaged on the silver screen.


Shorty looking a sensei word that leg sweep was perfect.


Bear in mind, this would have been at a time (1930's) when martial arts hadn't yet been popularized in society or film. So these moves may have been even more effective back then since attackers may not have ever seen or expected anything quite like it.


That last move she did used to be my favorite in Judo. Saved me from my seniors trying to rush


That's not your purse, I don't know you!


The dude taking the blows is impressive.


This looks kind of like Aikido


dear lord women were so much more attractive in the past.


This dude loves punishment.


r/mcdojolife


What a gem this is. Ive always loved the old clips when everybody spoke so politely and correctly.


Ladies used to have hat pins… very long, very sharp and useful if a man was getting handsy on the trolley.


Ladies if a guy is stupid enough to attack you wearing a necktie I'd go for that first lol


the sounds are the best. that man may get injuries lol.


Get that young Richard Nixon off me!


Biggest cap in human history ever


This is cool and all, but where is “kick him in the nards!” ?


was she an actual badass ? cutie!


I thought something was off with the year stated, from the clothing to the strong trans Atlantic accent it seemed much earlier...


ah yes, I see you know your judo well.


Love it. Very entertaining and proficient at what she does.


Just a suggestion, if they are not going after you directly, just let them have it. Your wallet or purse is not worth you getting hurt because none of the self defense stuff is as easy as it looks. I knew a guy with a 7 degree black belt who was rubbed twice on the street, he carried a few hundred dollars just to make sure the thief does not get upset that it was not enough, he probably could have killed the thief with a few movements, but still you never know what actually happens in a street fight and you don’t want to live knowing you killed or permanently hurt someone for a watch or a few hundred dollars.


I would really like a take from r/bullshido on this


Was getting kicked a common thing for women in the 30's? I dont even think getting kicked is common now? When was the last time you were kicked?


That’s basically hapkido.


Just break the wrist and walk away.


Basic Akido moves


u/savevideo


The muggers in the 60s dressed classy.


I could use a few girls like her.


Those grunts! 😬


"Everybody has a plan right up until they get punched in the face" - Mike Tyson.
These self-defense videos are pure choreography.  Any serious mugger would just ask for the valuables.   If they refuse,  just punch the victim in the face.   
Remember, most good boxing matches end with just one good punch.


That last oof was gold


r/bullshido


The lack of floor mat really drives the point home!


Anyone know who this is?


love the defense overlaid by that old posh accent americans used to do.   very ratharrrrr


I love it ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)


Isn't this just judo?


(deleted) ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `


Yikes. That leg sweep. Did gym mats even exist yet?


Yeah, this isn’t 1967. This is more 1927.


From a wrestling hand fighting perspective she’s correct to turn the wrist of the guy inward and down


This looks to be 1940’s or so.


I thought this came out tomorrow.


Made before mats were invented


Good techniques if the other party doesn't fight back.


Looks a lot older than 1967.


This looks more like 1947 than 1967.


Yeah that’s not going to work… at all..


u/savevideobot


This looks like legit judo/bjj


I am so horny right now...


And that’s when you pull out your gun. It’s very important to pull out your gun.


These are old-school ju jitsu techniques, more akin to judo than the Brazilian version we see so much of today.


TIL Aikido is lady's self defense.


This is NOT from the 60s. Lol.


The commitment of this guy is staggering and demands respect.


Poor bastard


classic judo and jiu jitsu here. great stuff.



 P


This kinda turns me on tbh


Dislocate his rrrrrist!


It's very nice that the attacker is waiting and doing nothing while the lady is kicking his ass.


The class...


Boy who would even do this


And they wonder why guys arent romantic anymore.


I see you know your judo well


Must have been the 3rd meatloaf night that week.

Reddit.. where people think 1967 was almost a century ago


This got a lot of women hurt


"And I bend sharply forward"

"OH"


A lot of these moves are exaggerated and the guys throwing himself like a wrestler.
But there was no harm in learning that stuff on the off chance a drunk started get aggressive.
I wouldn't work on a real psychopath.


So self-defense was this bad already at that time?


Self defense is well and good, but the problem is it can instill a false sense of security in those learning it. Your best defense - *especially* against a heavier opponent - is still escape. Any self defense instructor that doesn't emphasize this isn't doing their job properly.


You sure it’s not 1937?


Goddamn, that accent.


The first technique is illegal in competition judo because if the defender keeps on going down to the ground the attackers arm will break …. All in all good techniques


Damn when she dropped him the first time I was NOT prepared haha


Yeah, that TransAtlantic accent is definitely 30’s-40’s.


Agreed


It actually is the late 30s based on the clothes alone, not to mention the quality of the film footage.


Yeah, some folks inability to tell different eras apart is disturbing. I think it's a GEN Z thing. Since everything is on a phone or tablet, it all blends together. 

I had one 19 year old ask me what year the first Godfather movie came out, I told her to guess and she said ... *I don't know like* ***1995?***


This is exactly what I was going to say. That accident is not a 1960s thing.


Yep, that was NOT 1967!  Looks like 40's to me.


[deleted]


It’s like an character animation after a fatality lol


The way she rolled the r in wrist got me.


I love old videos like these. Especially British ones because they all try to sound really posh and proper no matter what they are talking about.and it makes.for.some hilarious sounding dialogue.


I would say it's at least 1930s because most film didn't have sound in the 1920s


1930s


The guy moves like Chaplin or Keaton. People were silly.


“Hey Josh we’re going to have you be the one who gets thrown around for the tape ok?”

“Yeah sure no problem. Are we bringing in some pads or? No? Just doing it on this wooden stage here?”


So I’ve literally broken someone’s arm using the first move. Fucker grabbed my chest and gripped his wrist and pulled and popped right off. Her composure is bad but the techniques aren’t terrible.


She kicked his ass 7 ways of Sunday.


Those are real techniques.  The first one is an armbar and Kotegaeshi.  Its a very reliable armbar when done with intent.


She's doing everything super slow and emphasizing every individual step, but when they all flow together, those are absolutely effective techniques.


Yep. The sounds when the guy hit the floor tho, like if its for a self-defence class, give that poor fella a tatami, pretty sure he cracked a rib or two there.


If you watch carefully, at one point he takes a dive.  Granted, it's probably because he's going to break his arm if he doesn't fake it, but even so....


She nailed that roll throw. The sound he made when he landed wasn’t fake.

That's a pretty good deal. I can't find a woman to abuse me like that for less than $20.


Didn’t even kick him in the nuts once


An easy attitude to have when your opponent does everything he can to help you.


More like 1937


Ippon seoi nage


I remember never quite getting that tomoe nage right. That must be why I never quite got past green belt. (But yeah, I totally wanted to mention judo upon seeing that too!)


What about a pointed stick?


I'm going to have to politely agree with the asshole husband on this one.

The likelihood that a 5'2" woman is going to fuck up her attacker after a weekend self defense seminar is extremely low.


Love the imagery of a dick head getting absolutely destroyed by his tiny wife.

Also please explain the toenails??


Some of them take a lot of training, but most of these moves can be picked up in just a few hours of practical training.


She’s Steven Segal’s mom


Came to say this and had me wondering who informed this technique if it was 1967.  Aikido came to the US sometime in the late 50’s I think, so it could have very well been the new hotness when this was made.


I came here to say this. I took aikido for about 5 years back in college, and these are definitely moves that they teach you almost immediately within the first few months. 

What's interesting is that Aikido was created in Japan in the early 1920s by Morihei Ueshiba, but didn't wind up in the states as a"thing" until much later. I don't even think Ueshiba gave the martial art a name until the 40s,and this video is from earlier than that. So this woman was possibly trained under Ueshiba or one of his students. 

There's a lot of comments in here about "oh this doesn't work," or "it takes hundreds or thousands of hours of training" for it to work. It most definitely does work if performed correctly,and it does not take long to learn these moves. (Try that first move with a friend, it is almost impossible to eff it up.) Moving an attacker off his or her center of gravity to take advantage is something that you can be taught fairly quickly. 

What takes a while is self-confidence, which this video is clearly showing. The target audience for this specific video is women in the '20s and 30s (yeah, definitely not the the 60s 🙄)... which is a period only 15 or 20 years since the suffragette movement, so women were only just feeling "empowered." So it's important that this video gets across the concept that "yes, you can do this and you are not helpless" for women. I think it succeeds in that.


My kids' karate class teaches exactly the same stuff.  I learned it in judo.  Turns out it's all pretty much the same.  You can find illustrations of these moves in medieval combat manuals.


Those classes are useless. You need to be training regularly against resisting opponents to be able to use these moves in a real self defense situation.


Eyes, ears, throat, reproductive organs.  

All are fair game if your life is in danger.  

Rip, poke, tear, grab, twist, hit, slap, claw, chop, kick, knee, elbow, bite.   Whatever you got.


I think a lot of women, and even men don't realize how much strength adrenaline and rage give someone. If a pissed off guy is already close enough to grab you by the throat then you're already in serious danger.

This demonstration is way too clean as well, zero actual violence on display from the attacking side, in real life you're probably getting punched in the face if someone is attacking you like that.


And the funny thing is, the people criticizing her form are likely less technically polished. 

She looks crisp and describes the kuzushi for each throw (although the guy is feeding it to her in the setups) pretty well.


Good luck running on high heels.


yeah, I'm no martial arts expert, but how well will these moves work when the guy outweighs you by 100-150 lbs? let alone fueled by PCP


Steven Segal shouldn't even be mentioned unless we are discussing his Russian mother and his bastard heritage.


It is very strange that your comment is getting down voted.. running away is the best approach for anyone man or woman to remain safe.. true you can't always run away but it's still the best move when possible


Go to r/fightporn with that talk. Telling women they shouldn't study martial arts because "men are much stronger" in a martial arts forum is just dumb.


This is the dumbest comment. Yeah, "while the man's choking you, just run and yell for help."


Most of these are literally actual martial arts techniques for breaking holds. They are not based on your strength, they are based on leverage. They are to be applied when someone grabs you, when it's already too late to run away.

How so? Its really just about training.


The basement-dwellers that think this will work in this thread are hilarious. Lol. No real world experience. They are doing women a huge disservice in giving them a false sense if security.

I love that accent. It’s completely extinct these days. Upper class English people don’t sound like that anymore, and instead have adopted an accent I’m personally not a fan of.


I dare say old boy


Or Madonna post 2000.


I didn't even watch with the sound on and can tell it's from that era based on the clothes and hair, there's no way that what she's wearing, how she's styled her hair and the man's suit and short, fat tie are from anywhere close to the 1960s, mid-to-late 1930s is more like it


I thought a transatlantic accent was an American thing?


That transatlantic accent is a dead giveaway.


That's what tipped me off, too. 

Some comments here say the OP is a bot, and that making intentional errors in the post's title drives up engagement bc ppl love to point out or correct mistakes!


Yeah, their lack of understanding different eras makes me feel like a dinosaur. 🦕 

Plus their primary media input is probably TikTok or similar where it's all about *trending.* What's hot NOW. 

I spent a lot of my childhood watching movies from the 1930s and 1940s, so those eras are recognizable to me. And of course i saw lots of family pix from those years. 

If you think about it, my generation considered movies to be old if they were 20-30 years old. So youth today who say movies from the 1990s or 2000s are old is in line.

Smh...

Time to soak my dentures...


How elegant of you


Those accents were atrocious. I'm glad I wasn't around to have to listen to them on TV and the radio.


There was a video years ago part of it is because of the microphones at the time. They had a transatlantic accent so different letters didn’t effect the sound quality as much

Did he also do a superman lounge like that, stretching towards you... LOL


The difference here is that the guy that grabbed your chest wasn't trying to physically harm you, but instead was probably being a pervert I imagine. This same move wouldn't work on a man that was trying to actually hurt/kill you.


Unfortunately they are way harder to pull of when your attacker isn't patiently waiting for you to make your moves. Most of these takedown seem like they would be pretty useless in real life.


Not really. Trained martial artists have shown how a lot of those moves don't work as soon as someone puts just a little bit of resistance.

For the same reason Aikido practitioners are not dominating MMA and throwing MMA fighters around like they do on their dojos with their students.


Yeah the first one is a Russian grip lol


Yes they are. Many of these techniques are bread and butter stuff to UK police and taught now.


The techniques are definitely effective, but you'd have zero chance of making them work without a solid base in a grappling sport and some athleticism.


You either go with the flow, or go the the hospital. He’s no novice in this arena.


Isn’t that what they say about akido demonstrations?  The attackers just fall down without a struggle because it’s either that or get a broken arm?  And, because of that, certain elements of the demonstration can seem like it’s faked?

Granted, I am not an expert.  Just repeating what I’ve heard and seen.


I watched the last one again assuming he'd kick off the floor, but he really didn't. That was all her launching him.


I took some Aikido classes and, yes, you will actually throw yourself over because of the pain.


Do the germans have a word for when a person explains why bots exist to a bot?


A bad fall can hurt people very badly, some techniques of Judo basically trip people into a bad fall. Therefore don't be surprised a small person can do one and succeed.


It’s not as clear cut as that. I’ve been the man in the suit for full-force / mock-mugging training. Don’t underestimate the amount of damage that people can inflict on each other when they attack eyes, throat, groin. There are no guarantees, of course, and men will generally have significant advantages in strength and mass, but a motivated women who has pre-forgiven herself for maiming her attacker can be legitimately dangerous.


MMA fighter uses their feet; their toenails are black and blue from impact. So, toenail polish to help strengthen them and keep them all looking the same.

We do roundhouse kicks in my boxing classes. You used the front of the shin bone to deliver the blow, but too far back and the top of your foot takes the impact. I have blackened toes after those workouts.


You wont be able to use them effectively in a real scenario if you don't regularly practice against a resisting opponent.


They can be picked up in a short amount of time, sure, but not applied in a realistic scenario.


No. They cannot.


![gif](giphy|EjFx0jioOoMZq|downsized)


yea except your attacker can do the same thing and is stronger than you and will be more effective. "Seeing red" is not a viable self defense strategy.


just shoot him already


Strippers: hold my 🍺


Agreed. Though Ive met several women and one man who would prove this wrong lol


People are dumb, I don't know what to say really. Lol.


I think you can do both study martial arts and run away/yell for help if you can. Same goes for men really.


These moves are dangerous for women against a man and you encouraging them to fight men in this way is really irresponsible of you. That being said, maybe martial arts would be nice to know against another woman, because a man will easily be able to resist this and overpower her. It's simple biology.


She could have possibly moved backwards and ran away since there wasn't a wall stopping her. In this situation a kick to the balls might have worked, not a move that the man can easily resist and overpower her.


That's fine and all, but I'm talking about a man vs. a woman. In most of these videos the man is obviously going along with her motions and letting her control him for the demonstration. In a real life situation, the man can easily resist her control and overpower her.


This video is just made to look old.  The frame rate is far too smooth and the picture appears to be high def with after effects to give it that older film look


Bots


I've wondered the same thing and decided errors generate higher engagement on Reddit.


Ironically, you are a bot account ripping off a comment from below.


Why did you steal a comment from u/spacedogUSA


They do this on purpose to get dozens of correcting comments and dozens of likes for each comment . . . and they get me every time.


Nobody sounded like that naturally. It was an artificial mix of uper-class English & New England in the USA. Hence "TransAtlantic".


That accent was always an affectation - both received and transatlantic are/were taught in prep schools rather than being something a person naturally picked up most of the time


Poppycock!


The sound quality is too good for the 1930s. It's more likely to be early to mid-1950s.


Nah, it was something a lot of journalists on both sides of the Atlantic picked up because they thought it made them sound more refined to their home audiences.


Isn't that accent in the US? From what I can find this lady was British


Idk if you realize how hard it is to know what actually happened when you weren’t the one there


probably pretty hard to break the humerus, but I have personally seen someone get a broken radius from it when the pair practicing lost their balance and fell forward. Uke was the larger one there too. That lock is legit and has been documented for hundreds of years in various systems.


Not by themselves with the single demonstration, but a fully trained person may well use moves like that in a real scenario


![gif](giphy|cXiKMqT4aiTtYjnf8E|downsized)

The Superman Lounge


quite the contrary he was the school bully and a fair bit bigger than me. I started martial arts at a young age..... he didn't know about it


It’s actually a police hold as far as I know. Well the wrist turning part of it.


I practice MMA, and the second one is the only takedown I haven't personally used in some form to win a fight. Now granted, I usually follow through and hold onto them after a throw to win the fight instead of getting away, but if I can use them to win a fight others could use them to get away from a fight. 

The reason they looks so useless is because the demonstration is basically a single snapshot of a fight right before she wins, instead of showing her breaking the assailant's form to open them up and make them vulnerable to her takedowns, so he just walks right into an "obvious" counter.


Also the attacker in the video lounges and makes himself super unbalanced (in the first bit for example). IRL no one attacks that way. They are  going to close the distance immediately.


Yeah but when you're demonstrating something for the first time you have to do it slow so people can see the moves properly. This is just a short clip so it's possible she advises to learn to do it smoothly and quickly.


MMA pretty much showed the world what martial arts moves do and do not work in an actual fight.


Nearly all of those moves are seen in MMA and grappling sports. You have a waki gatame (armpit armlock), a tomoe nage (circle throw) and two  adaptations or osoto gari (major outer reap) and seoi nage (shoulder throw).


Most of these are standard Judo and Jujitsu throws that are used in competition against trained martial artist that are absolutely resisting. They absolutely do work. However, her performance of them lacked flow and follow through.


Yep.  100 agree here


You don't do them just based on the video. You drill the form, then practice them sparring so you learn to do them in imperfect scenarios and work on learning to recognize openings. Grappling arts are not difficult to learn the basics of, and the basics are all you really need unless your assailant also knows proper grappling form.


Yes, but not after one weekend self defense class. 

I used to do Judo. I don't think I successfully threw a resisting opponent who was my size or bigger until I was like 6 months to a year into training 3 times a week.


Doubt. Some of the gnarliest fights I’ve seen were at the skatepark… Good luck trying to win by giving your opponent a “nasty spill.”


I definitely agree with everything you say here. But I would add that far more dangerous is a bigger stronger man, who doesn't even need to forgive himself to do violence to you because he's a piece of shit mugger/rapist who is prepared to do all of the things you are going to do to him.  Plus he's probably in a positionally advantageous position to do all of these things.

If you bite a bigger stronger attacker, but you don't have the proper engrained training to capitalize on that moment the bite gave you, things are about to get real bad


OOOOOOHHHH okay that makes sense. Thank you for the clarification. I hope your toes become strong like steel.


You use two places for a round house based on the situation one is the shin the other the foot. Shins going to be harder and take a bit better but the range is different, it’s mainly based on what the conditions of the fight are


Against a skilled assailant, you are absolutely right. Somebody who has taken just a quick self-defense course isn't going to be able to do much with these moves against the likes of Jon Jones.

But most assailants aren't actually skilled, and just rely on having more muscle. And against those, a week long crash course practicing two hours a day, one hour drilling the moves and the other hour pairing off and free sparing using the moves you know, is plenty to be able to train muscle memory enough to be able to pull out the moves in a stressful situation and break you free long enough to pull out mace, a taser, call 911, etc.


I think some parts of first move might work, if you hold tight and chunk your whole body weight into the back of his arm so it strains the elbow. At least if you weigh a decent amount. I think it’s a banned move in judo. 

The rest smells like bullshit though.


Like a panda eating bamboo.


Appreciate your effort across this thread. So many people in this thread who don’t train.


Strippers I know would have stabbed said assailant and likely robbed him by now.


Actually no.  Using pressure points and the man's own body weight, she forces him to move through pain and reflex. It's what most of the control moves in any martial art are based on.

The criticism is that the holds the man is using aren't really effective ones, and ones a trained martial artist would never use, *not* that he's letting her use his body weight and biomechanics against him.

But then, you're probably never going to be attacked by a trained martial artist, are you?

Yes, first rule of any fight is not to fight if possible. Running is good. But if some random thug gets the drop on you these kind of things can help you break the hold and *then* run away.


Lol. Oh so you're statement was based off of absolutely nothing at all.


Believe it or not, the account you replied to is a bot, too!


This has been true on all platforms for a while. More recently around here. Not sure why, I don't think there's that much money to be made here.


Wasn't film speed higher/faster back then? I would think the recorded audio being played back plays a part in that accent


Queen Elizabeth had this accent when she was younger. When I see old British films and broadcasts from the early 1900s they use this accent.


Yes, off the top of my head that accent was taught to the wealthy in private prep schools because it sounded like you were, well, rich and well traveled. It was a hybrid of American English and British English accents. It was also taught and used in Hollywood. It pretty much fizzled out after the Second World War.


Well there are scant details for sure, but didn't you say the kid was bigger than you? Idk man sounds unlikely unless you train or something.


Yeah, she's using moves similar to the actual ones, but she's leaving out key details and not doing them quite right.

Like in the very first move she just grabs his arm by the wrist and forearm to rotate it. But if he were fighting that motion she wouldn't have a good enough grip to rotate it. The proper technique is to reach over his hand with her right hand, grab the blade of his hand, and then rotate it. Because her whole arm has more strength than just his wrist she can then easily overpower him and rotate the arm. The rest of the first move is accurate.


Heey, that's the plot in Cobra Kai.


High five pretty much same as me. I had one technique where I'd take their wrist and go under their arm and next thing they knew I had their arm twisted up and behind them.


Thank you. Tired of reading posts from people who don’t know these techniques and don’t understand them. It’s a demonstration


> Not really. Trained martial artists have shown how a lot of those moves don't work as soon as someone puts just a little bit of resistance.

She is literally doing Judo.


A lot of those same moves are used in MMA, it's just a lot more subtle, so it doesn't look the same, and trained MMA fighters aren't going to be easily trapped as a normal person, so you have to use more advanced aggressive moves like arm bars vs locks. But if you watch closely an arm lock usually precedes an arm bar but only for a split second. What she is doing, is most definitely used in MMA, it's just that they go further and faster, so you don't see that transition.


Struck a big blow to the Bullshido industry

But more poignantly, when it comes to street fighting even trained fighters put themselves in unnecessary risk. Mike Tyson broke his hand in a street fight, once.

Also, even if "the moves might work", the average lady or guy taking self defense classes is not going to be at a level of mastery and fighting competence, especially when surprised and adrenaline is pumping.


The class my wife took was four weekends.  I remember 32 hours of classes.  

I took a kayak class. I have a hell of a time uprighting a kayak. My wife can flip up instantly. She looks like a sea otter.  Women have lower centers of gravity and do great in a kayak. Men have a higher center of gravities and drown! 

The low center of gravity gives women an advantage to roll and flip bigger opponents. Learning how to use that to their advantage is critical.

In judo, you still respect your opponent; broken fingers or dislocated sockets get you kicked out of a match. In model mugging classes, those are encouraged.


I only use kicks to close distance, so I can use knees and elbows. Also, if you can get good at your timing, people are really vulnerable right after a kick, and you can absolutely destroy them in that little time.

Heels just become a potential weapon.


Lol. Okay buddy.


What the hell, what’s even the point of that comment bot?


A lot of the 'viral' content you see on Reddit are actually advertisements in disguise.

People farm karma so their accounts seem legitimate and then sell them on marketplaces where advertisers or bad actors purchase them.


Different accent. The accent she is using is a blend of American/English that people would adopt in film.


I train but I’m a different user than OP lol


That's mostly because throughout most of the 20th century all martial arts was taught rather statically as Bruce Lee called it "swimming on dry land" - there's a huge difference between self-defense class judo and judo taught for actual sport


It happened in the 90’s afterall haha


Jujutsu but yeah.


>Mike Tyson broke his hand in a street fight, once.

To put it into a better perspective, it was a pretty minor hairline fracture. And Mitch Green got his eye busted and knocked out clean. Green was being the aggressor, and Mike was putting his foot down, so it's not too clear how unnecessary those risks were. Especially in the fucked up mind of 1988 cocaine fueled Tyson.


>The low center of gravity gives women an advantage to roll and flip bigger opponents. Learning how to use that to their advantage is critical.

For every "perk" of being small there are like 5 other advantages to being big. Being smaller is never an advantage when it comes to fighting. Weight classes exist for a reason. If you ever participate in a grappling martial art you will learn very quickly how much of a difference size makes.

Sure being shorter might help you execute a throw against a larger opponent but because you are smaller it will be twice as hard to off-balance and move your opponent into the correct position to even execute your throw.

I'm not saying its impossible. I've been thrown and taken down by plenty of people who were smaller than me, including women. It just takes a lot more time than 32 hours of classes to be able to reliably use what you learned in a real high-stress situation. And if you never practiced against a resisting opponent during live sparring then you will never be able to apply what you learned in a real scenario.


>In judo, you still respect your opponent; broken fingers or dislocated sockets get you kicked out of a match. In model mugging classes, those are encouraged

In a mugging situation your bigger stronger attacker can do all of that too

>The low center of gravity gives women an advantage to roll and flip bigger opponents. Learning how to use that to their advantage is critical

That's all well and good, but having a lower center of gravity won't even come close to making up for being smaller, weaker and most likely less experienced in violence than your attacker.

>The class my wife took was four weekends. I remember 32 hours of classes

if you aren't already trained in some martial art before the class, or continuing your training after those 4 weekends, it's basically just as useless as a 3 day or 1 day course.

Being good at violence takes practice, dedication, and time. End of story.


I love how your argument boils down to "Woman weak, man strong, run away" and mine boils down to "Real shit, Actually works, Here's why"

I don't care if it's a BOT, it was a good BOT article then. :D


Yeah there's a lot of hidden ads but it's not an ad platform like TikTok is for instance. It's not prime influencer breeding ground.  

This is my opinion anyway. I know most companies couldn't give two shits about using influencers to advertise around here. Not a lot of makeup and fitness gurus.  

Reddit seems to be slowly headed towards that direction anyway, with them removing third party apps so the platform is more enticing for influencers. I've seen OnlyFans women come flooding more and more since the change.


In my experience there’s a British and American version of the accent/speech style?

I don’t really see how’s there’s even a hint of American in the woman’s accent from the video in the post?


Judo is a bad example though, since Judo was developed by taking a school of jujutsu and only taking from it what could be used in sparring, so you could get train more realistically.


Aikido, but yeah.


This doesn't work in the real world, and you trying to convince women that it does is very ignorant, or evil of you. It is simply biology, or do you deny simple biology?


Turns out being able to train realistically is a very big deal - especially when you aren't regularly fighting on the battlefield or against bandits


Aiki-jujutsu, but yeah.


Listen, "friend".

*I know these techniques work. I've had training in them.*

It's first year white belt stuff in any competent school.

You're the one trying to say women are weak and could never ever get out of a hold no matter what because men are just strong. Don't try to turn this around. You're the one making sexist remarks and talking out of his ass.


Bujinkan, but yeah.


There is nothing sexist about biology. It is what it is.


Terrible argument. You're only showing your inherent bias, and as it has been this whole conversation, you have nothing actually relevant to say.

Aside from the head bobbing, I'd love this. Head bobbing in real life is easy because your brain fixes it for you so you don't feel sick. In a video game though, your brain doesn't fix it as well as its not your vision and head bobbing. Thus so many get sick.

And then we get sh!t like Starfield that can’t run without DLSS+FG at a decent amount of fps


I didn't realise until 20 seconds in this shit wasn't actual footage. 

Say all you want about the required specs, this is insane levels of quality


Environment looks absolutely amazing 10/10. Arm with watch 8/10. Stick that was thrown at snake. 7/10. Snake looked underwhelming. 6/10.


Its the headbobbing that fools you to think its "realistic"


But it uses Nanite and Lumen so it runs at 40 fps on the most top end hardware.  
But it's fine guys, we included DLSS and frame generation 🤡

(I actually don't know if it uses Nanite and Lumen, i said this for the joke)


Target fps for 4090ti is 15


Imagine gollum with insane graphics... I am pretty sure the slew of these sht games are made by AI and shipped at a min, so even as a review bomb they make money... 

Now imagine graphics like this, but every quest is just tedium grind fetch quest...


The Photogrammatry assets look great, and the lighting is good (Unsurprising on both accounts due to Lumen and Nanite, but well executed) But Honestly, there is very little going on in this scene to make it mean anything.

We know it ran at 60FPS on a 4070 but there is basically nothing happening. This is a tiny level in a secluded map with no game mechanics, or AI present, It's basically an in engine Cutscene.

It is visually pretty impressive (Except for that hilariously bad snake model/animation) But honestly I don't see anything that makes this astounding, we've been seeing amazing Photogrammetry stuff for like 5 years now.


Oh god the head wobble is awful. Dear game devs, never use this stupid mechanic


Showing "insane graphics" on 240p video :D


I can hear my pc sizzling


Camera shake is so stupid. That isn't how we experience reality. It's just headache inducing...


Anyone know what game this is?


UE with no micro stutter? Fake!


This isn't really a game, it's a pre rendered animation in UE5 made to look like a game. So not running in real time, and probably not representative of what actual games will look like, for a while anyway


hard to judge when reddit has compressed it to a maximum of 240p o\_o


insane graphics, now look at it in this shitty webm or gif wtf the fuck this is.


Great graphic style & lighting, looks realistic and very cool for VR experience.

![gif](giphy|h5LlfJSPluEGrM88yW)


Demos are fine.  


Let's see how it scales.   


Let's see how it managed this level of fidelity AND even slow paced realistic FPS or action based situations.  


How does it provide this fidelity and anything outside of heavily scripted, rather than dynamic calculated at the time of happening events, that can be altered a thousand+ ways by player interactions?  


Demos are great, but let's see the walls this beautiful piece of art is framed/trapped within.


That snake looks fake as hell lol


boy, i tell you this 240p video really drives home the message


Looks great in 240p


in crisp clean 240p, courtesy of reddit


realism killed vidya


Unreal 5 is cool but I don't want every developer to use it, that just gives too much power to Epic, they might be able to increase the prices with no repercussions


And you just need a 3999$ computer to run it smoothly at 1080p with 60 fps


Great for graphics (as in images) and video/film, but I wouldn't want to play a game that looks like that.


It's so realistic that it kind of brings me back to when games in the 90s had FMV, especially the part with him walking through the dark using the lighter.


Minimum requirements 4090 for 30 fps on 1080p with dlss


high rez 240p:D:D


A demo means jack shit. You can make this look as nice as humanly possible it has nothing to do with actual games and how those look.


Idk ue3 demos looked the same. Not a single game looked even close to the demo. Just a pointless demo to show off features noone ever gonna see/use.


90% of this sub will still scream that it’s unoptimized because their 2060 can’t run it at 1080p native


This is a total scam, the footage doesn‘t even stutter. Totally unrealistic.


Hardware used:

Nvidia RTX 6090 Ti x2

AMD Ryzen 7 8800x4D

420 GB of DDR6 Ram

Liquid Nitrogen AIO

all for a crisp 30 FPS


I dont wanna see graphics i wanna see gameplay, artstyle, fun.


Games will never look this way as long as people with 10 year old gpus keep complaining


Can't wait for a full release of all these "showcasing" videos just for it to be with half the graphics and running at 30fps in 1080p on a 4070, it would 100% not happen, right?


NGL this game looks boring.


Turns out all you need to fool people is do some swanky camera motion 

Remember Unrecord?


No way it's ain't pre rendered. You would need a supercomputer to run this demo otherwise.


Who holds their phone like that?


5090 at 720p


2 fps on a 4090 iam sure


It definitely looks good, but not completely mindblowing.  I'd say other games like Uncharted look pretty similar in realism.


15 fps at 540p low settings in menu with a 4090 confirmed


Dear game devs, we don’t need ultra-mega-super realistic graphics for every game. What we need is a good game story, a complete game that can run even on a potato PC, no microtransactions, and, most of all, the ability to pet a cat and a dog. Also having a waifu in game.


Yo! UE5 + Lumen and Path Tracing is looking insane!


It‘s all lighting. People created stuff like this for Dreams on PS4 all with proper and realistic lighting


Runs at 1080p 20fps on an RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7950x3D with 128GB quad channel RAM.


Looks like a walking simulator. All graphics, physics and world interactivity zero.


It's unoptimized!


Does not really matter if art direction is ass, and so far most of UE5 games look bad.


The max resolution of this video is maybe some hint about the impossibility to run it at high res?

Also, camera movement adds a lot of realism, but it's not engine related. Any game with decent graphics, boring (real) colors and realistic camera movement feels realistic. Just go watch RIDE 4 gameplay in first person.


Wow Johnny Strides is stepping out of his comfort zone.


One thing I have noticed with all of these demos is that the lighting is spot on. I am not talking about the lighting being cast onto the rocks an statues. I mean when the character looks up through the trees at the sky it really good. Very close to human eye reaction.


This runs on more PCs than cities skylines 2


Can't wait for a lazily developed AAA game to launch that run 30fps on 4090.


It is safe to say that the gaming community thinks visually this is amazing but worries about how it will be run. 

Game developers and hardware engineers really need to look at their target audience and contemplate over our concerns a bit more. Recent game releases have been shocking to say the least and going by whats said here has some of us question our product purchases. 

&#x200B;

YEah sure it all looks cool but can we run it?


Too bad we can't experience a game with this kind of quality without owning a super computer these days


Showcases are great but let's start seeing some real games!


Imo, it has always been that if you have realistic shadows and lighting or just beautiful lighting, the game instantly has "insane graphics".


To be fair, this is a 3d scanned graphics. Which is still good, but not as impressive.

And that kind of stuff was available to ue3, UE5 just added ray tracing, which is a bonus. Also, skin textures (and muscles), but those will eat resources like crazy.


Great, now make walking simulator with graphics like that and slap $80 price tag on it.


Looks fabulous.  But......the game mechanics are going to be the exact same tedious crap we have been using for forty years:  "you are in a forest.  You can see an axe and a key"


The way they lit their lighter was weird as fuck. Just thumb the wheel thing you don't have to jerk it like a rip cord on a lawnmower.


True walking simulator.


The big reason why this feels extremely real is because of the virtual camera. 

That means the camera isn't animated by hand or mouse but instead the movement data of the camera has been taken from the phone which has gyroscopic data.


There are parts in Lords of the Fallen that look this good, it’s mostly rocky areas with this kind of terrain. The same game has some pretty bad assets in other areas though, especially things made of wood which look like Skyrim wood.


The way the camera is swinging left and right almost like it’s supported on a string is very annoying and makes it feel less realistic. There should only be a movement when the character takes a step and the way the camera movement is setup break the realism for me. It would have almost been better for it to not move at all but then you get the “ice-skating” movement effect. They need to make that swing more realistic to achieve greater immersion.


Ugh I hate when people add ridiculous amounts of head bob and motion blur. I got a headache just watching this.

Pro-tip: This shit ain't realistic because in real life your brain corrects all that so it doesn't make you nauseated. Putting it in your game does *not* make it "more realistic" looking. 98% of people immediately turn it all off if there is an option to do so. Just stop.


freaking awesome...


It feels and looks like everything was a recording rather than an animation if that makes any sense. You can't move around freely like you would in most games... I'm not sure how to explain/describe it. They look like everything was a video recording that just plays whenever you perform actions or reach certain points.

But maybe that's just this one part. I don't know.


I got motion sick after watching this for a few seconds because of the shitty head bobbing. Why the hell do so many developers think that looks good, it's not even realistic!

Also, the character's animations are oddly smooth and slow, it really breaks the immersion when the character is taking smaller steps than a toddler while smoothly moving their limbs.


Allan wake 2 would still have higher hardware requirements.


Meanwhile Cities Skylines 2 is barely putting out 25 fps.


Still waiting for games to look as good as the UE3 tech. demo.


To bad all Unreal games suffer from shader issues and stutters.


Yeah my 1660 ain’t running that


Do we really need this?


I can already smell my gpu combusting


Yeah posting a 360p video to showcase was definitely the best option.


This is impressive. However, I really can’t stress enough how little graphics mean to me. I want to have fun playing a game. Gameplay is important, not the graphics. Perhaps I’m alone in this, but to me it’s just a waste of money on hardware for the part of a game I don’t really care about.


Insane graphics in 360p. Thanks!


my 3060: please boss, dont 

me:  :)


I feel like these demos always look insane but the games never do…am i alone here?


Games in the next generation are going to be so life like, few will be able to tell the difference.


Imagine a Sons of the Forest sequel looking like this.


I thought this was a new Shadow Warrior. Give me the Wang!


Man i wish gameplay was the main focus on games these days , God knows i've played too many games with good looks but no substance


That's actually more quixels fault than it is just because of unreal engine. The camera movement also tricks the mind into making it look more realistic than it actually is


Would have been nice to also share the source so we could watch it at full, or at least, a better resolution than this 240p crap video.


Go watch a trailer for Asgard's Wrath 2 after this and then cry that what we're seeing here isn't what VR is in 2023.


Nice rocks, now show me a dragon


\>insane graphics  


\>uploads 240p video  


Bro.


Good thing it was uploaded to reddits shitty player in 360p so it can truly be showcased


Oh shit it's FYQD??? This one guy made Bright Memory Infinite and somehow got Yui Ishikawa to voice the main character in the Japanese dub


what's insane about this? i see only the camera movement and  motion blur that makes it realistic...


Wow, in the first second I thought this was a video recorded in real-life, and the "UE5 demo" part was supposed to be a joke. 

But damn, that hand looks really bad. Seems like it will take at least another 5 years for realistic skin in games.


every hyperrealistic game like this absolutely butchers the animations and ends up making the experience feel less realistic than it would have otherwise


Even assuming that the hardware to run this is a non issue, try imagining a game this photorealistic with an average game HUD, or a spooky enemy. Its so deep in the uncanny valley that I'd bet it would be almost entirely unplayable.


its very hard to implement in game


this looks like going outside and technically imo isnt that impressive from a dev perspective. for UE yeah its great, but as a dev this is just like a bunch of photogrammetry assets plopped down to make a scene. there's 0 artistic direction or intention and imo that is boring af.


That's nice and all but I just stopped getting hype for any trailer out there now. Gameplay or not I just can't trust trailers anymore. Wait till it comes out and see how it goes.


Hah was that an ultrawide polaroid?


i thought this was one of those GTA 6 real life videos i used to watch as kid and believe


Now give us an UE5 game that doesn't have garbage performance.


Rtx 6069 minimum requirements


That's pretty but I hate the GoPro camera shake. That would make me feel sick in a game and it takes away from the role-play immersion rather than adding to it.


I really can't wait for games to be indistinguishable from real life


Remember folks. Graphics mean nothing if the gameplay is shit.


I’m certain my 3060ti can handle it.


Is ti gonna run at 720p  while only using a single cpu core like all other unreal engine 5 games so far?


gameplay?


Should've just linked to the source... Resolution and compression of the uploaded video does not do it justice.


Insane graphics ... showcased in glorious 240p on reddit's terrible video delivery service.


Graphics are nice and all, but it still has the obvious fake camera shake. If they can fix that, even things with half as good graphics would look realistic


I know this is a massive over simplification, but that's just photos, right? 

Someone went around with a very good camera and then pasted it into the engine. 

We have been seeing these tech demos for years now, yet every game using worse looking graphics runs like shit.


is this really 360p? there must be a HQ version right?


Just smoke


so are the prices/performances of GPUs, so that's going to have to wait for the regulars


240p


1 fpd (frames per day)


Damn, if only reddit's video player didnt insist on streaming all video in 480p


It looks like Ethan Carter from 2014.


I can't wait until we ate able to push this level of fidelity in VR.


proceeds to post a clip running at 240P with no links whatsoever, i can't with yall


You’ll need DLSS version 420 to run this shit. Down scaled to a 2 pixel by 2 pixel resolution


That 'screen dimming' effect needs to die in a fire. Cyberpunk had the same thing and it drove me crazy until I modded it out.


240p cmon really???


this 4k footage looks so good in 240p


I think it would be better without the slight fisheye distortion.


Good old overcast sky trick. Your direct and bounce lighting could be inaccurate or even non-existent but as long as the ambient occlusion is on point overcast will always look realistic.


Can't wait for the 5000 'lost on a mysterious island' asset flip games that it appear because of it.


I still have the PC game box for Unreal rotting away in my archives. \*ACTUAL GAME FOOTAGE\* in a big fold out for the front cover :)


I predict a lot of found footage horror games at first, till they realize they tridash


You're saying this isn't a vlog?


I don't know what it is but looking at the demo on my phone I'm like wow this is amazing and indistinguishable from reality...but when I look at it on either my 1080p or 4k monitor I'm like wow these are pretty good graphics for a videogame but I can still tell it's a videogame. 

Overall still the best graphics I've seen in a long time, but I get the feeling that even if games had this level of graphics now it would still feel very much like a game and less like real life.  

Imagine moving the mouse around like you do in normal games and not the this pre-established walking path, I think it would have a much different vibe.


In glorious 240p, thanks.


I'm jaded af but Photogrammetry environments don't impress me. Just a dead environment of nice photos.


I hate all these video "demos" - If I can't download it and see it on my own machine running then I simply don't care any more. People have been miling UE5 videos for far too long.


minimum spec: nvidea rtx 6090TI


I don’t want games to be realistic ._. 

Nah it’d be cool


Insane graphics: normal graphics but with head-mounted camera shake.

Important to remember we also can't get even bad-looking games to run well on PC these days.


Now showcase the various incoming enemies on screen and going down to 10 fps…


These Skyrim mods are getting out of hand.


it's photogrammetry. It's basically a photo. I wonder how dynamic the scene actually is


Cant wait for games that look like this to be badly optimized and run like shit


If real, would probably be better optimized than Alan Wake Cities 2 and Starfield


This is kinda uncanny valley for me.


Seriously, we are on the cusp of not being able to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. That blows my mind.


İnanılmaz


Can't wait to download a 1 TB demo.


Will it run on my 486?


I won't lie, those ultra realistic games always feel the worst to play, clunky walking simulators most of the time in my experience


Nice proof of concept. This was made by the person/people that made the Bright Memory games, so maybe he/they'll actually cook up something not too far from this.


Can't wait for shitty games to look ultra realistic at 80$ and run like a gtx550 would with crysis remastered


This for rtx 2077


Holy crap that looks fun


This is just a video of a real place turned into a game… it’s not really that high tech. Instead of building a map they scanned one


It looks fine, but you can make anything look great when it's all scripted.


All I can think of is this better be what TESVI looks like


Still waiting for a game.  All we get are demos.


Is this sekiro in the future? Hehe


Am I the only one who thinks thisbis too much? I think games are better off with less realistic graphics than that.


I have a 3080ti and I feel like my computer would blow up if I tried to run this lol


It looks amazing, so obviously I’ll hate it for the next 8 years.


with fsr turn on of course!


graphics showcases are better designed than any game using the engine ever will be


Can't wait to play UE5 games on my 7900XT @540p with 12fps on low settings:D


I can only imagine what Love Death Robots would look like in UE5. I would cream.


I can already see my pc smoking trying to run this


but full games will never look like that


Can't wait to see this run at 60FPS on a PS6 Pro


My computer, my computer, my computer is on fire.


dam those graphics are unreal


I can’t wait until games actually look like this in regular gameplay running on regular pcs and consoles


I don't like this, it looks good and all but we are no where near ready for these sorts of graphics, developers are struggling to hit 60fps (Shit even 30fps if you're Cities Skylines 2) so I really don't see this UE5 demo graphics being in actual games for a long time.


Cool. No computer is gonna run shit like this.


FYQD? That's one person! I really liked Bright Memory and  can't wait to see what's coming.


They can make everything look frighteningly realistic...except the phone.


idk what comes after this, UE6 will probably be like 4D Cinema with wind and water effects


Neat demo.

Can't wait for the release 1080p version.


I mean it's cool and all but unless it's in an actual game with everything else going on, it might as well be a pretty video.


Insane 360P


I always hate how phones look in video games. In real life they have a very specific look to them because they emit light, while basically everything else doesn't. In a video game tho a phone and the hand holding it and the rocks behind it are all emiting light because it's on a screen, making the phone somehow look more fake to me.


You’ll need a 48GB GPU for this.


Dat motion blur and fixed field of view texture draw


RTX 5090 Prototype x4 with some new gen SLI

Unreleased 16 core Intel prototype with an industrial chiller

69 GB of DDR5 Ram

DLSS 4.20 + Frame Gen

8 FPS

If that aint PCMR i don't know what is


From author of the demo:

 >" the scene is actually so small that it runs at 60FPS on an RTX4070 at 2K resolution."

15+ million polys is now small ?

But yes, surprisingly good framerate. Considering that for example this one runs at 3-4 fps on rtx 3060:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AShGmWyFamY


>Equipment SONY A7M4, use 35MM focal length to take 5000+ photos (I continued take at the scene for about 120 minutes), use RealityCapture to align the images, generate a 15 million polygon model, divide 4 to 6 parts into the Unreal 5 engine (this part Depends on the computing speed of the CPU, I'm using a 3970X for computing).


What? You guys don't have 5090's??


GPU render farm


It's not that bad, man. You guys are complaining too much. I used to work on set and I can tell you that it contains a GTX 3090 Ti, a baby's leg, two CPUs that require you selling your soul, and five PSUs. The rest is just the basic top-shelf stuff that you can't afford


Pull back and show us the scene.


My thoughts exactly. If the average person thinks they will be playing a game like this within maybe even the next decade, they are wrong


now let's see paul allens set up


CPU is a 3970X based on the vid description. Gives you an idea $$$


You also need 5 Air conditioners directed right at you because your new PC produces 10KW/h of heat.


https://youtu.be/5kJljpC5sHE?si=lvmpU9-f4BygugxK

Got it.


Yeah I was kinda annoyed that a graphics showcase video was posted to reddit in 240p quality [(literally)](https://i.imgur.com/6U6Hxn9.png)


you telling me you're not gonna play this game with a shitty bitrate compression?


No new information will be added. Only what the AI upscaler thinks.


That's why I can't stand those "shoulder camera style" movies.


For instance I couldn't play payday 2 without the head bobbing removal mod cause otherwise I was getting absolutely sick


Yes i get dizzy watching this


yeah, the games seem to forget that our eyeballs are *really* well stabilised. the brain(if installed, and functions normally) automatically focuses on an object of interest and locks the eyes in positions such that that object remains leveled... take that out, and we get a nausea inducing video such as this one...


It’s great in VR though. I turned on head bobbing in No Man’s Sky when playing in VR and it helped a lot with the motion sickness


Games need to stop putting in these things your brain already does (or corrects). We dont' need motion blur, our brain already does that, it's just making everything look blurry and bad. We don't need lens flare. Our eyes are not cameras. We don't need depth of field mimicking focus when our eyes already do that when focusing on something. They want to mimic all this shit our eyes and brains do, but that's just doubling up and we can't turn off natural phenomena to let the game handle it.


Amount of it is key. I like there to be a moderate amount. None is just as bad, depending on the game type


I wonder if that's better in VR. Ive never walked in a VR game, but would head bobbing be "fixed" there since you have a bigger field of view and so your brain can fix it for you?


Movement without any headbob feels like shit and like youre a ghost flying around the place


Holy shit, so that's why I was feeling sick in some of those fps games. TIL


Funny because zero bob makes me feel sick. I've been working on stuff in Unreal and running around with no headbob I end up dizzy. I added just a little bit and I don't get dizzy. I'd give the user the option though.


yep, I couldn't watch more than 30 seconds of this video, instant headache.  Shaky cam isn't realism.


That and the FoV in these types of videos always annoy me. Trying to have a realistic camera yet you have obscene amounts of warping at the edges.


To be fair it's also nanite being able to handle those super heavy assets.


Exactly. Lighting and everything is very good too, but the realism of the terrain is cause it's just scanned and photo-mapped. Still pretty cool.


I'm pretty sure they've just recorder someone move around and put that in lol


A bit of insight into why this may be, found on youtube:  


>【Dev details】： Camera SONY A7M4, use 35MM focal length to take 5000+ photos (I continued take at the scene for about 120 minutes), back my home use RealityCapture to align the images, generate a 15 million polygon model, divide 4 to 6 parts into the Unreal 5 engine (this part Depends on the computing speed of the CPU, I'm using a 3970X for computing), background is an HDRI map, the scene only has skylight, and there is no extra light to fill in the light, character lighting was created individually for cutscenes.  After that, I downloaded the Metahuman arms and body in Unreal Engine for the character, and downloaded lighters, IPhone, masks, photos, and trees from some 3D model websites as props, so I almost didn’t spend too much time on 3D model creation.  The animation was quickly captured within 20 minutes using ROKOKO equipment, and the finger joints were repaired using MotionBuilder, the biggest time spent was creating cutscenes to ensure that the entire shot ran smoothly, and several voice actors were hired to dub the game, I purchased some sound effects and music on Audiojungle and asoundeffect.


I hate when they only focus on graphics and forget about good animations.


Can you elaborate on what basic movements were poorly executed? It looks good to me, albeit not exactly realistic


the movement is like if I was filming with my iPhone. The shakiness would be annoying in game but adds to the realism aspect


thx man, i was thinking the same thing, such title and u put 240p =)


I miss being able to give awards. Take my fake one instead...

Nanite will probably make it less stressful on your PC.


You gotta remember that if this sorta tech won’t be used on consumer hardware for at least another decade.


This isn't a game.


I'm not sure I agree. If you pause the video at any point it looks bloody realistic - the lighting and ambient occlusion is what is doing the heavy lifting. The headbobbing is really just the cherry on top that takes it out of the uncanny valley like you'd get with a controller ferinstance.


I had the opposite thought. This looks hyper-real, but the shitty animation work ruined it. The character moves really smoothly and unrealistically, yet at the same time their head is shaking up and down a few inches as they walk.

Head bobbing isn't a thing when you walk around in real life, I don't get why developers love to add it to their games and ruin them.


> Camera shake and blur is doing a lot of work here.

Guess you missed the part that says "demo".


Yeah it amazes me how people can get on board with these "games" like unrecorded, camera movement & post process effects do all the work but it would be unbearable gameplay-wise. 

The graphics are OK but really nothing exceptional, juste good photogrammetry for the textures & nanite doing some work in the lighting area.

The Vanishing of Ethan Carter looked as convincing & it was 10 years ago.


it's just to show the realism aspect as if someone was recording with his  iPhone


Starfield is a 'game,' this is a poorly animated character walking at an unrealistically slow speed around a pre-lit photogrammetric scene.  There's no real lighting work going on here at all, it's basically just a 3d model using photo textures generated by taking lots of images and making a point cloud.  This 'demo' is just basically moving around a single 3d object.


Also, nanite and lumen aren't performance killers, yeah they're heavy but actually it would be worse if they weren't there.
Plus the use of lumen removes the field disparity in the RT department as in most cases it runs the same on both Nvidia and amd gpus


> But it uses Nanite and Lumen so it runs at 40 fps on the most top end hardware.
> But it's fine guys, we included DLSS and frame generation

"How dare software makers push the envelop and force hardware makers to actually progress their shit instead of repackage yesterday's tech at today's price!".

You guys are seriously weird.  It's like you never want PC gaming to improve beyond what current build you have.


Hey now! You can set it alllll the way up to 360p!


was thinking if that was my problem or the shitty player


It is rarely, if at all, a conversation about actual code/asset optimization. It has always been about the software being demanding. For all we know, a game that runs well on old hardware could be unoptimized code/asset wise, but since it hits an expected baseline performance, it is suddenly "fine".


I mean its for sure real. But it's likely a shell. You walk, that's it. No interaction or anything. Though this is the tech Lucas Arts uses for its shows now for anything going on around the actor.


Hard to believe, but it is real, it's runnable on a 4070 and this isn't the only UE5 example that highlights the incredible graphics.

The problem with these canned demos though is that the environment is limited, they usually aren't massively expansive or interactive with a tonne of things happening so it does create a false impression of what's really going on under the hood given the available computing resources.


Because essentially no lighting is happening in engine.  It's all photogrammetry.  It's basically walking around inside a picture.  The some of the leaves, the snake and stick look absolutely horrible because they're the only separate 3d objects


> YEah sure it all looks cool but can we run it?

People have to stop expecting "high" and "ultra" on mid tier builds on  day 1 and the answer is yes.

The problem with releasing a game that runs "Ultra" on mid tier builds, is that the game doesn't get better a few years down the line when people upgrade their rigs and revisit old games.  There's no place to go if the game is already running at max settings at top FPS.

It's fine that your current rig only runs the game on low.  Next time you upgrade, and you replay the game, it'll look massively improved.


Yup, they used the same tech in Ethan Carter, it's called photogrammetry. That's why the game from 2014 looks on par with this tech demo.


It definitely has the same vibe.


8 FPS sounds generous.


5 minutes after release, modders release patch that makes it run on a VoodooFx card in 60fps.


oh, the same as my first build. also i'm a 6 year old that mowed lawns for 9 months to get the money to buy it.


480p


The only good news I suppose is SLI making a comeback?


Using intel as the CPU is megaLOL. Use the 52 core AMD RIPTHEWORLD^(tm) coreRIPPER^(tm) to bump your FPS to a godly 12fps. Dont be a peasant.


You meant RTX 6969, didn't you?


4.0 and not DLSS 4.20?


Lol "SLI". What decade is it?


>Unreleased 16 core Intel prototype with an industrial chiller

Alternatively, a 1024 core Threadripper Pro with a scientific phase change chiller.


hehe 69 gb


You can probably grill on that CPU


And the DDR5 is running at 42000


But can it run Cities Skylines 2?


No no, its regular hardware that puts out about 1 frame per minute. They just leave it running over night and compile the footage like a good old render!


I think a lot of the "small" is just view distance. They aren't loading the entire mountain and then having to cull 95% of it as unused geometry like they would if this were an open world game.


The more these tools become useful for the advertising or film making industries which can deal with scenes running at low framerates, the more tools are developed for the gaming industry. So, it's all good news. 

I for one am not impressed with hyper-realism, I do appreciate the cinematic approaches more and these can be even more taxing.


> 60FPS on an RTX4070 at 2K

Since the vast majority of users will always have 60 series and 50 series cards this unfortunately tells us those users will likely continue to endure the scourge of "medium" settings which is going to vary from developer to developer as to exactly what they'll get.


Wow, that's awesome.


To be honest, 4070 is almost twice as powerful as 3060 non Ti. There's more of a gap than one might think. It's still impressive though.


> generate a 15 million polygon model, divide 4 to 6 parts into the Unreal 5 engine (this part Depends on the computing speed of the CPU, I'm using a 3970X for computing).

That's for the process of importing the photogrammetry-built 3D scene into UE5, not for running it in real time.


at this point use the ACs to cool the pc


Thank you for doing my job kind Internet person!


protip: even if you have a 1080p or 1440p monitor, the 4k resolution vid will have a much better look. 4k has way more data and your browser can downscale to 1080p or 1440p with a lot less loss than youtube's 1080p encoder. Youtube prioritizes size reduction over quality.


thx!


Source? I wish to see it with higher resolution 👍

(YT compression sucks)


Thank you! Reddit's compression algorithm is abysmal


It’s in 240? It looks great on my phone through the browser…


360p here, but yeah, this is happening more and more.

Somebody uploads the next crazily realistic graphics and I'm left wondering how much of it is my brain filling in to compensate for abysmal resolution, intense compression, fat motion blur and headbobbing like my eyes were mounted to a teacup being carried up a mountain on a tray.


Like Hardcore Henry?


Succession comes to mind. So much shaky cam. Love the show but that was my biggest gripe about it.


Payday 2 in VR mode with head bobbing still enabled is motion sickness barf central


The head bobbing would need to be countered by fixing the focus point on the distance and only move the camera. Instead they move the whole camera and rotate it in the wrong direction.


Imo even in VR, there shouldn't be headbobbing. Movement that doesn't align with what your body actually does tends to be nauseating.


Headbob is not enough to convince me otherwise.


Tbh any hand movements sorta fixes that for me


Yeah I agree, especially in traversal centric games like Dying Light.


I do 3D animation as a hobby and for them the trick is that have an extremely minor soft camera bob to replicate that smoothing that our brain does for us and then to have non-points of interest things on screen be moving in order to mask the camera bob.


I think in games I'm playing I like headbob and can stand it because at least I know when I'm moving and where. Watching videos with it sucks balls though, and especially this video where it's all over the place and the view is all loosey goosey


Like a camera in a wheelchair.


to be fair it's just a small scene 

we've all seen what happenes to ue5 tech in actual games


True, but I don't think it would be much different with low poly geometry and keeping the textures, so it can run without nanite. Most of the detail is in materials here, not geometry. Nanite just saves dev time. But from [what I heard](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/nanite-performance-is-not-better-than-lods-test-results-fix-your-documentation-epic-youre-ruining-games/1263218) it runs like shit on weaker hardware.


Which gives us shaky cam, not the type of vision our eyes deliver.


Aha, that's really interesting - thanks for sharing. There's a lot of work gone into that. And I can see now how the 'manual' camera technique used would have resulted in the motion we saw - especially if it was all handheld. It would be hard to replicate natural motion in that way.


forget animation, I want physics  


in game physics has barely moved since HL2


the animations aren't the point here, brother.


The head movement is too much, too exaggerated especially when panning. Sorry, my tired brain can't think of a more technical, specific way to describe it right now. Looking down seems pretty smooth. Another poster posted a snippet on how it was created that could explain a lot.


> the movement is like if I was filming with my iPhone.

Exactly, a handheld camera.

> realism 

It's a first person game so that is at odds with a viewpoint captured on a handheld device. That's bad for realism.


Wait they removed rewards?! I didn't even notice


Like it's currently used in Fortnite?


How did you end up with that idea?

Literal Fortnite has been running on UE5 since 2021, just like [a whole bunch of other games](https://gamerant.com/all-confirmed-unreal-engine-5-games/).


Definitely. u/b1ue_jellybean says so. It must be true. He's the tech prophet!


I didn’t say it was.


There is a lot of hard outlines on this graphical implementation. It is especially noticeable on the golden statues where there is extra shadow to show relief.

I’d expect that shadows could be turned down to help with this.


I mean it looks good for sure, but it's not gonna look as realistic when it's made into an actual game. We don't see any real closeups, the lighting is dark, the resolution of the video is dogshit and there's motion blur so even still frames aren't really clear.

First thing this video made me think about is Sons of the Forest, and you can get stills from it that looks supreme too, but the game isn't as convincing when you actually play it.

[Ex1](https://www.gamerguides.com/assets/media/17/298/sons_of_the_forest_tips_and_tricks-bd78a333.jpg)

[Ex2](https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4104686-sonsoftheforest3dprinterlocationandcraftableitems-1.jpg)


Also the constant focus shifts threw me off big time. Blur the whole screen because the character looks at the phone on the bottom left?

Also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkiBymKZbWY&t=11s


The snake, and snake animation looked really bad too.


Guess I also missed the declaration that specifies every demo has to include camera shake and blur. Given that this implies it's a demo of a game, imo it should strive to look like the game will (well, *would*, not like they're ever gonna release anything)


It's only "nothing exceptional" because of how well Nanite can handle massive objects. I've used Quixel Megascans in both UE5 and Blender, and UE5 can easily handle millions of polygons without lagging, while Blender becomes unusably slow at \~1.2m-1.6m polygons, and starts lagging at about half that.

Though, it doesn't necessarily mean the graphics themselves are good, it just means that making games photorealistic is easier than its ever been. You could still make photorealistic games before this was possible.


>The graphics are OK but really nothing exceptional, juste good photogrammetry for the textures & nanite doing some work in the lighting area.
The Vanishing of Ethan Carter looked as convincing & it was 10 years ago.

lmfao


> The graphics are OK but really nothing exceptional, juste good photogrammetry for the textures & nanite doing some work in the lighting area.

>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter looked as convincing & it was 10 years ago.

lmao. yeah ok.


Show me a game you would describe as "exceptional" then?

Also, this is not a game, this is a demo. Something to showcase the engine and most of the time to max it out and see what it is capable of.


>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter looked as convincing & it was 10 years ago.

Nostalgia is one hell of a drug


Nanite is not "doing work in the lightning area". Nanite is virtualization of mesh geometry.


Starfield is an objectively unoptimized crap, older games look better and run on oldest hardware with better performance


So would something like this have been possible without UE5?


Nanite and Lumen ARE performance killers.
It looks beautiful an all, but the only optimized way to render shadow today is to still use the old method. Baking shadow maps. Same for Nanite, the only optimized way to render polygons from a distance is to manage and code the LOD yourself.  

Theses steps are time consuming and really annoying to do. I understand that devs wants to use these technologies, because the engine computes everything by itself and it looks better. They want to spend more time developing other features. But today, lumen and nanite kills your fps


Global illumination is a performance killer. Nanite tho straight up improve performance.


Yep PCmasterrace for better graphics and better performance, until their pc's can't push better graphics then it's unoptimized.


Yeah sure, not to mention the size of the texture...


4070 lol


Where did I say game need to be at ultra level?


He just forgot the 0. Infront of it.


They have done the interpolation of the frames using Google's IA, just for the aesthetic


Thats after they have slowed the game down 100 times. Real frame rate is about 0.8 fps


Then we wrap it back to GlideFX and get it running on a GeForce 2


What a looser! I bought mine after 6 months flippin burgers


With the size of current cards, how do you think a second one will fit in your case?

I guess we would need old school full towers


RTLI ON


Sure. That would mean 4k for gpus alone not fun


Lol $3,000 for graphics cards lol. I'd retire PC gaming then.


I wouldn't call that good news.


I'm guessing Nanite is doing some of the heavy lifting too. Not in regards to their statement, but in general.


Great example on this are Horizon Zero Dawn

The game uses occlusion culling, which means it only draws what the camera sees and ignores the rest. This saves memory and processing power, and makes the game run well on the PS4.

Occlusion culling is not new, but Horizon Zero Dawn does it really well, using different techniques like portals, frustum culling, and hierarchical Z-buffering. The game run smoothly while you can explore a huge and varied world without much loading or glitches.

Recent great example includes Spiderman 2, TOTK, and Elden Ring


Yeah don't post the shit version of a video that supposed to showcase high quality graphics. It's.... counterproductive.


You are welcome my friend ;)


What was the point of ripping a video down from youtube to re-upload it to Reddit..?

Internet points..?


It only had 240 and 144 options via the desktop website


Your phone is a very tiny screen so ofc even low-res stuff will look "great" because the display is so small that you'd need a magnifying glass to spot all the details that would be instantly visible on larger screens.


I really wanted to watch it, but i had to stop because i was getting a headache every time i tried it.


No Man’s Sky has an option to toggle head bobbing and I actually found turning it on helped with the motion sickness in VR


With that I agree. In this video there's definitely too much movement, and it all feels unnatural. It moves like it was recorded with phone, which would be fine, but its just too smooth to feel like phone / cheap camera recording


Just from messing around with it myself, it seems like it imposes a very high initial cost to render a single triangle with it. After that it scales insanely well from that 1st triangle to rendering movie quality geo. [Here's a video of shoving the entire movie scene of Moana into UE5 in real time](https://youtu.be/NRnj_lnpORU?si=xpIhiyilbNaK7niI&t=266). There's basically a hardware bar that comes with the cool features of UE5, once (in like 5 ish years) most people have hardware that clears that bar it'll be pretty rad tech that enables most people to have movie quality assets in their game, especially since UE has a large libary of photogrammetry scanned geo with Quixel megascans.   


As far as that person's assertion about manual LODs vs nanite, It's true that there are a lot of techniques that can be used to get games to look that good on current hardware, but they are pretty time intensive once you scale your game up. Most artists do not want to make manual LODs, and if you make manual LODs you need to reauthor the LODs everytime you change the source geometry. (I have some direct experience with this, I worked as an engineer on an in-house AAA engine where I did automatic LOD generation and H-LODs). Automating LOD generation has been a problem for forever and it's really hard to tune, especially when you're talking about not just preserving silhouette edges but also normal detail on the interior of the mesh. Really depends on the quality/look you're going for and how your materials work.  


The other thing to note is that there's lots of things we are used to doing with textures to kind of fake geo complexity that we may not need anymore, depending on artist workflow. Technically speaking you don't need normal maps with nanite geo, you can just make the geo with that geometric complexity. That doesn't speak to workflows where you want to make some geo, then add detail using mask painting or something so that you can instance the geo, but make each instance feel a little unique though. Overall I think nanite is a super cool tech that may not fit everyone's needs and is kind of like a peek at the near-ish future after players have had the chance to get higher spec hardware, and developers have had more time figuring out how to leverage its strengths while mitigating weaknesses and maybe lowering some of the high initial barrier to entry. It definitely solves a real need which will accelerate high quality games and lower the barrier to entry for smaller studios to have games that can compete visually with much larger studios once being able to turn the feature on becomes more accessible to more hardware.


Yep, I want to say the start of Oct or Sept. No more coins, no more awards. Now they have a program to sign up for to do things. If you don't mind giving Reddit your info.


How soon do you think this level of realism will be available in actual video games.


Lol we can see the footage of both games and they are clearly different orders of magnitude in fidelity.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJljpC5sHE original source that goes up to 4k.


Oops I meant Lumen


There's a reason I put game in quotes. It absolutely is nowhere near as optimized as it should be.


Absolutely. I saw very similar demos going all the way back to unreal engine. 3. The only thing that may have increased is the polygon count, and the texture size. And that could be a function of hardware and engine improvements.

6 year old demo in Unity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=hCeP_XUIB5U

Ethan Hunt was done in a similar style, on an older engine, and with more manual work for lighting (which made it look more game-y)

Cryengine has the same kind of workflow.  It's not often used for games because it's got limitations in where and how it can be used without becoming a hinderance.


I mean yeah that is clear, tho to not do that, lumen and nanite are great, the reason why there was a lot of hype for them at release and they pushed hard on them during the engine's showcase


2-3 GPU generations from now it would run okay, I guess, even on middle hardware. Right now, yeah. It's meh. But on the bright side -  the developers will have time to familiarize with the workflow, so we might get better games when the new hardware is feasible


Double digits now we're talking


In 10 years you'll get one faded Polaroid, feed it into your AI and you'll get a full neverending open world game generated


You're way late. 

Someone's already got it running on an 80's Casio Wristwatch.


Room sized PCs are making a comeback!


>frustum culling

I think this doesn't work in modern games since the game needs to render off screen objects for ray tracing.


Tbh the compression of the Reddit video player makes it look better than it actually does.

It loses so many details that it ends up looking more realistic than the 4k version on YouTube where all the small "uncanny valley" details are visible.


For real, why not just link to the source instead in the OP instead of ripping the video.


I had 360p option on desktop and on old.reddit.

Thats still like.... absolute crap. Like I can tell it looks good, but I can't see any detail at all.


It’d be kinda funny if someone somehow stabilized the entire movie.


Interesting, I wonder why that is.  I'll have to try this


Yeah, that's what I was thinking too. Nanite and UE5 will become the norm in 2-3 gpu generations, when even midrange hardware (rtx \*060) will be able to run 60-90fps without any problems in 1080p or 1440p

I agree that manual lods could be a considerable time and effort that can be spent elsewhere, like more assets or better gameplay. It is the way to go, imo, it's just not quite matches the hardware that exists right now...

> That doesn't speak to workflows where you want to make some geo, then add detail using mask painting or something  

I feel like we're slowly moving away from that. Unless your game is highly stylised, or voxel minecraftish look or somehting. Afaik, people scultpt almost any detail with geometry in zbrush anyway, then they just have to bake. But with nanite, you could just export high poly, if I understand correctly?


Who knows? Maybe next year, maybe not in a decade like you said. Nothing's written in stone. A lot of the tech introduced in ue5 is not hardware limitation but the limitation of production. 

The whole concept of nanite is to optimize the amount of polygons to be used in a game, making it possible to use higher poly meshes for games, while it wasn't possible before. 


Why you don't see nanite and lumen in actual video games is not because it's heavy on the hardware, it's because if you do use high poly meshes for video games one thing nanite can't optimize is the actual size of the high poly assets. A simple level like you see in the post would easily exceed 100 gbs in storage because of the use of super high poly assets.


Yep. That is why it is important to push new technologies so they improve over time, even if they are bad at the moment. We just need to be aware of the pros and cons.  

I don't know why i get down voted for saying that though. Downvoters probably have little to no experience with video game development and don't really understand how Nanite and Lumen works.


Nono, as in 0,008 FPS


Get enough people to feed their old Polaroids to the AI, and we can fully re-create the entire 80's!


Ray tracing is awesome (Especially [NVidia DLSS and color refraction](https://youtu.be/DbuKZgZpDP8?si=S1ZsWEMMZUYLyf8C)), but it doesn't mean you have to render everything that's not on the screen.

You only need the stuff that affects the light and the reflections. Frustum culling can cut down on the things you have to ray trace, and also on the things you have to rasterize.


Do you play at upscaled 720p or something?


I'm not as lucky lol https://i.imgur.com/6U6Hxn9.png


At that point you need to use SPF instead of FPS

This would be 125 SPF


Black Mirror right here


>affects the light and the reflections

If it's an object in the world, it affects light, unless it's deliberately excluded from the BVH or is really far away.


Sounds fast.


>125 SPF

That is some serious UV protection right there


An SPF value of 125 sounds pretty high, but the effectiveness of each SPF value drops pretty quickly after SPF 30. 50 SPF blocks about 98% of the suns UVB radiation, but going up to 100 SPF it only goes up to 99%.


This is the unhinged commentary that attracts me to Reddit.


Most of square enix games tend to have these long style demos that transfer into the game when you buy it


Played demo yesterday, amazing, instabuy


Companies stopped with demos because it was losing them money, turns out you have to make a good product, else if its just middling or bad you just have people try a free trial as opposed to buying into the hype


The Dragon Quest XI demo is maybe the best I’ve seen, it’s the first 8 to 10 hours of the game and progress transfers over. Extremely generous and you’ll know by the end of the game is for you or not.


Note to self. Download ff16 demo


So for a person who HAS NEVER EVER played ANY FF GAME. is it wise to buy ff16. I mean will i experience less then a person who had played prior games.if yes how much my experience will be effected


the ff xvi demo was amazing


Square, Nintendo, and Koei have gotten good about demos for the last year or two. Square is especially admirable, because they keep doing demos even after doing so showcased how bad games like Babylon's Fall and Forspoken were, directly contributing to them flopping.


They are clearly proud of what they made. They know it gonna be good. They know, if you like this, you will probs like the rest of the game. But the biggest takeaway here is the fact that they are proud of it and know its good and so they're more than happy to share. 

If you don't pop out a demo, i'm now forever going to question if your game is good or not.


Amazing game, totally would buy on release.


The demo was incredible! I went from skeptical to must buy.


This demo gave me PTSD. 10/10, would cry and be traumatized again.


Demo was so good. Has been living rent-free in my head since Monday.


Holy shit yes! That story took a turn I wasn't prepared for.


Also if you enjoy souls like games, Lies of P just put out a large demo as well, holds up really well


I am a 34 year old, hardened man. I don't get emotional via media at all really. I bawled like a fucking baby at the end of the demo. Being an older brother to "the golden child", that looks up to you like a god. That fucking scene. . . The pleading. . . The maddening RAGE as he is watching. . . The sheer fucking brutality. . . It's the most emotionally impactful moment I have ever felt playing a video game.

I'm buying a PS5 just for this game.


This game is wild.  What a storyline


Wait, there is a demo for 16?


I mean, it comes from the dude with the game with the best demo ever.  
The producer of this game also helms Final Fantasy 14, which has the base game and first expansion as a 'free demo'.

Hundred hour demo? Check.


Loved the demo. I think I am definitely getting the game at some point.


I love FF generally but after FFXV I wouldn’t have preordered had I not played this demo. I would’ve gotten around to it for sure but the demo sealed the deal - I want to start playing on day one. Definitely good advertising if you’re bringing a well made game.


Was on the fence, but after the demo..WOW. Pre-order complete


You know what was a great demo back in the day? AvP2


I just  finished the  demo 5 minutes  ago. Im fully sold on the game and I love the combat.


It was my first Final Fantasy game that I've tried. I loved it, and will be buying for sure. I must say the performance mode was disappointing. Also, the quality mode was unusable with the motion blur. I hope it's better at launch.


Every game needs a demo


Demo went from 😁 to 😟😭


I've been replaying the hell out of the last boss. I can't get the parry timing down. But I loved it, I was kinda on the fence about it and was going to wait for reviews but the demo sold me on it.


Is it real time battle? I haven’t seen anything about it yet.


[deleted]


Definitely a good idea putting it out cause I was dead set on not buying it based on the previews but now I actually might.


Every game needs a demo, so you can try what you're about to buy

old ways need to come back


They've been very successful with that strategy with FF14 online.


Love watching Yoshi-P / Koji / Soken / Creative Business Unit III succeed :)   


Hope the full game in its entirety is as good as the demo.


Clive gives off a Jon Snow vibe. I swear man.


The FFXVI was absolutely bonkers, it fueled my hype for the game. I liked they just let you play the first 2-3h of the game. It really set the tone well.


I'm sold in FF16 after playing the demo. I just preordered the collector's edition. I've never played a final fantasy game before besides a couple of hours of 15. I couldn't really get into it.


The FFVII Remake demo did it for me. I replayed it dozens of times.


>All games must have demos.

Fixed.


I will have to check this out. After FFXII I lost a lot of interest in the RPG series. Bought XV and the most fun was catching all the fish with my wife. I cannot seem to stay engaged for long periods of time anymore :/


Performance needs to be addressed but yeah I enjoyed it


Aaaah the good ol' days...


God damn beautiful!


My main takeaway is someone on the team is constantly yelling GET TORGAL BACK ON SCREEN NOW! They know what works XD


Rather than saying false promises and selling pre-orders to a game based on hype and cinematic advertisements, FF16 made a curated demo experience that perfectly showcases the game and story.


Squares been leading the charge with bringing demos back it feels like. Shit on forspoken for being boring or whatever. But at least people had a chance to try it before release.


never been into final fantasy before but decided to give the demo a try because of all the praise and HOLY SHIT, it was amazing i dont think any prologue has captured my attention like that, such a well done demo


I'm blown away by the demo, it got more than 2 hours worth of content! Which is rare nowadays


I didnt do the combat section of the demo. I will wait until next week. 

The demo itself was very nice and good intro the game.

EDIT: I hope they actually sort out some of the blurring thats in the game.


Is this demo still available??


Easily the best demo I’ve ever played


I think I already found my game of the year with FF16


I was upset that there was really no sub to talk about the FFXVI demo when it released. 

But wow, it blew my mind. This is definitely GOTY potential.


Is it a prologue? I usually don't like demos or trailers because of spoilers.


It's crazy they don't. A good demo (NOT beta) would pour in the pre-orders. That is assuming it wasn't buggy as hell.


I got the demo for Half-Life amongst a random bunch of others back in the day. Such an epic random find for 11 year old me. Played it over and over until my birthday when I convinced my parents to buy me the whole game.


Lies of P demo was really nice, I played it for like 7 hours


FF15 did this too, it was sone bizarre small toy world thing that was fun lol.  Love these ideas though, need more demos!


Keep forgetting this is a PlayStation exclusive. I literally ran to my Xbox before I remembered thinking I had missed a demo…


I loved it. The beginning was so great. Had it on preorder so I’m glad I got to start it early.


There's a DEMO!


One of the first games I installed on my switch was a demo, funny enough.
It was metroid dread's demo and my GOD was it fun.
You couldn't save in it so that was a bummer, but honestly I had so much fun for 2 hours or so of continuous play time before it actually ended.
You know a demo is good when you forget at some point that you're playing a demo.


I feel the demo was great and made me want to get the game to continue. Also, was the perfect length where any other game would have to be returned if it wasn't someone's cup of tea on a platform like steam.


The budget needed to create a demo like this is about as much as an entire AA Marketing Budget.


I wanna play it but I wanna go in blind. Diablo will keep busy for now I guess.


I had already planned on buying it because the aesthetic and setting appeal directly to my soul but that demo made me MAD it’s not out yet.

Absolutely incredible game from what we’ve seen so far and I can not wait to play the entire thing.


They do. 

In fact they released one at almost the same time as the FF16 demo. It’s called Lies of P you should try it.


FF16’s Demo definitely stands out, but even Resident Evil demos are great, it would be so much better if demos were an industry standard, especially for PC.


The demo was made to be good and probably the best demo in a long while for marketing purposes.  Finally, people can see that not buying pre-orders is a good thing


I heard somehwere that regular demos had a negative effect on sales but demos with the entire prologue/start of the story with transferring save data actually has a positive effect


This demo actually sold me on the game.
Cinematography was probably the best I have seen in a game.
Haven’t played many final fantasy before. Are they usually this bloody ?


I miss the PS3 days where literally every game got a demo. Hopefully this starts the trend up again


Same.  Just got done and wow that gameplay was amazing.  Saw the trailer was meh about it then heard dmc guy was on this project so I got more interested.  Played it and omg it felt so good.  The extra story at the end where you have most of your kit made it feel so good.


Putting a demo out would mean they would actually need to polish the game before release, does not seem to be the case for most companies


This is what happens when you have a polished product you're proud of. 

I think a major part of the reason we don't get demos anymore is the sheer fact that games are not ready to have a demo when they come out.

Riding on pre-orders, bugs, performance issues, unfinished content, 50gb day one patch, games nowadays are really not worth presenting to the public until the last second before they come out, sometimes even after. 

Studios would rather make a vertical slice people can't play through as a gameplay trailer or "15 minute of gameplay" video, rather than let the player interact with the product before buying it, because I think they realize players will most of the time not be blown away, and it will leave a negative experience and impact sales.

When you have a game that's this good and polished even before release, you can afford to let players explore through a part of it, because you know it will actually build anticipation rather than disillusion people who have only seen trailers.


More demos. More demos. More demos!


Fortunately they started to release demos again recently, like during all the 8th gen demos were rare af


Demos are a show of confidence, many games are the opposite, not even giving it early for journalists.


Yes I 100% agree, see I got ff15 and it sucked, made me lose interest in ff games except ff7. But I been hearing good things about this game so I checked out the demo a couple days ago and now the game Is pre-ordered. Square Enix coming back baby!!! Now please make a good kingdom hearts game with a good story and you guys have me back frfr!!!


It takes a bit of work to make a good demo. Stuff like this seems good where you're playing the first couple hours of the game, and then transferring that save directly over. Square does this a lot with their games. 

I haven't played the demo, glad people are enjoying it. When the game comes out I'll probably try the demo and decide if I want the game.


I remember having played the demos for Warcraft II and Starcraft.  I eventually ended up buying both games and spending huge amounts of time playing both games.  Even if it ends up being a lot like Diablo II with new quests/missions and maps, and better graphics, I will probably end up buying (and liking Diablo IV).  By the way, I wasn't so thrilled with Diablo III.  That was a major let down - partly because it felt like it was too much work to determine how each weapon or piece of armor compared to another.


SE's demo policy is quite good for their games, even for those "bad" games such as Valkyrie Elysium.


If a game is expected to be 40+ hours long, then a 2 hour demo should be mandatory. Progress carries over and you just continue on playing.


Always loved the sword and magic archetype, before ff16 Geralt was my favorite version. Now Clive might be new favorite.


I just remember not realizing when it switched from cutscene to gameplay in the first sequence even though the controls were being displayed. I was just mesmerized at the intro


Watching Moist Critical play this on Twitch was awesome. For those that don’t know he’s a pretty popular social influencer whose contend mainly consists of video games, VG reviews, tier lists, whacky news, goofy criminals, and movie reviews


Totally sold me on the game


ALL GAMES SHOULD HAVE DEMOS. 

It’s the best way to know weather I want to buy a game or not


I was worried they would pull a forspoken but doesn’t seem like the case


I was already buying this. BUT my god after the demo the wait is unreal I’m so intrigued by the story and the combat is great.


I thought I was going to wait until the FFXVI game was discounted, but after playing the demo, I am sold. 

This is how you get my money.


Have to agree
This was the first time I played a demo since I was a kind that made me remember what demos are for


Yeah, but the game needs to be amazing and the demo needs to be smartly made.


I dont preorder, I've preordered a physical copy of this though.


I played the demo and I cannot believe how quickly it pulled me in. Not many games in recent years have been able to do that. Very excited for this one!


I will buy it once it is out and i know it works.


MGS2 demo is the GOAT.


This story sincerely seems incredible, and I am very, very invested in the characters.

Also no joke, Cid's voice is the series voice to exist in a FF game..I cant get over how it makes me swoon.

I'm also really glad that the M rating and mature, violent tone seems to be playing out really well. It's kind of surreal to be playing an M rated Final Fantasy, but it seems to be a strong step that's hard for game series to do.


I am hooked on the Lies of P demo. Holy cow, so good. FFXVI is an easy buy for me, too. Just have to wait for a sale. I have purchased too many games recently....


asian devs are putting out demos left and right. good thing. the west will never follow, they are too afraid that forspoken happens


I think I still have a case full of old Demo discs for the PS1 somewhere.

Loved the Demo for this.


Obviously needs some tweaks to gameplay before the main game releases. But *DAMN* did this demo get me hyped.


Yes this! I first got into the Octopath Traveler Series because the demo for the first game was so good!


I tried this at the wrong time. I was tired and stopped. 

Will definitely open back up


Tbh now all games should have a pre release demo


I'm a firm believer that every big game, if not all games, that have announcements and stuff need to have demos.


Is the demo free and also is this on PC?


Wish this was on PC as well, first FF game that has gotten my interest in the better part of a decade.


More games need games like FFXVI.


I loved it, I was always going to play the game anyway but this ensured I will buy it immediately. It also shows how confident they are in their product, unlike SOME other companies/releases in recent years...


Shareware on floppy discs used to come with the entire first act of a game. So act I of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D, the first level of System Shock, there are others but those stand out


I had no idea a demo was out I’m definitely gonna be trying this later today or tomorrow thanks for putting this on my radar


Shoutout to Supraland. It has a demo that is the whole first area of the game, and you'll be certain by the time the demo ends whether you'll want to play the rest of the game or not.

If a first person meteoidvania/puzzle game sounds appealing, I'd highly recommend it. It's also one of the few games I've organically 100%ed, as they give you tools to make that fulfilling after the main story is complete. Actually, after I got 100%, I started another playthrough in the same sitting. Every other game I got 100% in, once I got it, there was a feeling of "thank God that's over".


I wish i still had time to play games. But when i do intend to just play chrono trigger or breath of fire 2 on super nintendo.


I've been missing demos for years. I know they're a pain to produce from a development standpoint, but they can be SO helpful. There was a time when it seemed like every big release got a demo but they've gotten increasingly rarer.

And it's a good thing in this case. Before trying the FFXVI demo, I was 99.5% convinced I wasn't going to buy it. Now I'm about 95% convinced I WILL buy it. A tremendous turnaround I wasn't expecting.


Wait whats this about save transfer from the demo? Like if i play the demo the night before full release my progress will be where i finished the demo for the launch of the game?


God I need this to come to Xbox or PC


Yes! There’s a ton of story and character development, your progress carries over to the final game, and you get to play the combat tutorial *and* try some later game combat. It left me totally invested in the hero and wanting more. What more can you ask from a demo?


not the intention to sound like a doomer . The ff 16 is god tier ! . and i think the whole game will be . THO if every game start doing this . i can see a issue raising ... Dev will put extra work in that "2hour" part . polish it . make sure it look good . have epic moment to hook you up . and once the game release BAM it full of bug from chapter 2 onward . game story is lackluster etc etc ... (now game already do this ... but now they would be able to hook fish with this demo format)


So many great games this year and we are still in June!


FF demos were always dope


Games were actually finished back then.


Just buy a game in steam and you can refund as long as you played less than 2 hours and it has been less than 14 days since purchase. Infinite demos!


I agree. It's always the games that don't need a demo like this one that get one. I wish demos were a standard within the industry.


I cannot wait for this game on PC, going to be rough avoiding spoilers until then.


In these days most demo’s hurt the game more than they do good. Probably the reason more devs don’t make deno’s no more.


Perhaps


Love to see all these positive takes for FFXVI this week, tbh Square deserves praise for actually releasing beefy demoes like this. They've been doing it for a few years now and it's definitely something they should be lauded for.


Reminder that FFXV also had a decent downloadable demo (the Platinum Demo, now unlisted), which also had a final game bonus for finishing it. This demo was slightly different from the main game though, and did not actually include full game content (it did include relevant game content before the story, but that was a big part of FFXV release with also a full length CG movie and mangas in the mix).

IIRC, FFXIII, FFXII, FFX, FFVIII and even FFXVII had demos with magazines and/or other games, distributed on CD/DVD. Although they weren't available in all regions some of the times, and they also didn't always have final or near-final game content. Demos were mostly always kind of well fleshed out and I would argue the FFXVI demo is the longest and apparently closest to final game from what it seems. It's basically 2h of the first chapters content, and then a fair bit more of an advanced chapter which is stated might differ from end game.


is the demoavailable for ps4?


Why put out demos when they can charge us for them as "early access".

On a more serious note, I used to love demos. Back in the ps1 era I used to get 5 pounds pocket money a week and it all went on demos without fail.


Games just need demos. Period. Although I guess having a modicum of content in the demo is a thing. I remember when demos also would just be 5 minutes of gameplay.


I completely agree. Demos should more common and very well could lead to more sales. I played the demo for Horizon: Forbidden West since I was looking for something new. I tend to play the same type of games, especially Final Fantasy and was getting FF16 no matter what, but the demo for Forbidden West was so much fun I ended up buying the game as a result. I also downloaded Horizon: Zero Dawn because of it. Same thing with Valkyrie Elysium. It looked like a cool game, but I was not sure if I wanted to buy it until I played the Demo. If more companies offered demos they would get a better reading of where sales would be in my opinion. People will decide if they like a game if you can play a few hours of it before spending money. If they like it, they will buy it. Either at launch or wait for a low price.


They cant release the garbage we’ve been getting like redfall then lol. If i got to play games like redfall or gollum beforehand i would 100% not even looked their way.


xv had a good demo too - but how could i know the last quarter of the game was trash. i heard they updated that a bit, but i‘ll never play xv again.


If more AAA games had demos, they'd probably sell a lot more at full price. I'd be willing to be the decrease in day 1 sales is tied in with the elimination of playable demos. I refuse to pay full price for a game that may be broken or may just suck.


DOOM 2016 has one, wonder why they dropped for eternal


I’m glad you like it! Just keep in mind, a good demo does not automatically mean a good game. Look at what happened to ff15. Demo was beyond excellent Released game was very much less so.


So like just about everything square puts out these days? I've seen a few people say this now and I find it funny that you and others haven't noticed them doing it pretty frequently these days. It's great.


How to Slay your Dragon


Lots of games on steam do demo's now.  Mostly its the big triple A developers that do not demo.


Damn new link design is cool


I thought this was the beginning of totk


And Lies of P but yeah this demo was awesome.


Such a beautiful times


Less games release demos bc they know they arent releasing full products. or they are too small of a development team to do it


Speaking of the devil, I'm playing it right now lol.

The game was mediocre fine. That is of course until I found crafting and I be damned that shits pretty fucking enjoyable. I love it


If you're a souls fan I highly recommend trying out the Lies of P demo. I was thoroughly impressed


lies of p was soooo goooood


The game even let's you play a later segment with more abilities to get a feel for the combat properly


or shadow drop like Hi-Fi Rush


Lies of P!


A shame that they didn't make a PC version of the demo


I agree, I wish they'd go back to making demos for most or at least some games.


PlayStation only i presume ? ( PC gamer here )


We just need more companies like square enix in general to be completely fair


From Europe, is this demo not available in our region yet or what? Can’t find it on the PS Store


O_O


Don't developers have to have a pretty good chunk of a (nearly) finished section of the game to put out a demo.

With the current standard of day 1 patches that fix 150+ known issues. Are they even capable of a demo?


Anyone else remember that guitar riff from the PS1 demo disc??!


The issues with demos is that they’ll always be great and the areas the demos are in, are the best parts of the game (usually the start of the games) and most well polished, but it usually doesn’t always translate well to the rest of the game. They’ll work hard to make the demo seem amazing and perfect, but then the rest isn’t as convincing


I have a quick question to this franchise.

Is it like kingdom hearts, where you have to play every game to understand what is gooing on?

Or is it more like zelda, where (most of the time) it a whole different storyline and playable without knowing the other parts?

Or is it like assasians creed, what has a bigger overall storyline but the games are enjoyable even without knowledge from previouse games?


I keep forgetting it's out. I hope you actually do more than "that one combo." Just saying, one of my biggest pet peeves is being drip fed basic moves. Parrying should not be an unlockable skill, dammit!


I'm gonna play it again


Yes.


Every game should have a demo.


For sure. Nowadays the standard for trying out games is refunding them on steam after 2 hours. While it's less convenient for the consumer the companies save a little bit of money by you know not having to make a separate demo even though it would not be that much work I'd imagine. On top of that some people might accidentally play for 2.5 or 3 hours and can't refund anymore... ez money.

But we'll see, ff16 got so much praise from the community that we can hope other companies start making demos too.


Its really nice to see demos are becoming more of a thing again.


Tried to download the demo today, only to realize it's a PS5 exclusive. WHAT THE FUCK!!!


as soon i finished the Demo and they gave me the option to preorder the full game, i didn’t hesitate. i was 90% sure i was going to get the game anyway , but the demo solidified it


the demo was really insane. normally i really dont download ( or buy 0,25€? ) demos but i was unsure and the demo sold the game for me.

after playing both parts i preorderd the game. thats how you do a demo and sell your game.


FFXVI and Lies of P demos both made me want to buy both games immediately. Now I’m just sad I have to wait.


Is nobody concerned that the combat felt a little basic? Even in the Eikon challenge, the abilities were pretty lame imo. The little sphere grid is very basic. It's pretty disappointing for a Final Fantasy to me. The rpg elements seem to be mostly removed. Not that it isn't fun and intriguing, just basic for a mainline FF game.


Yeah, it made me cancel my pre-order (was pre-ordered only for the steelbook). I thank them the chance to save my 100$. I mean, it's definitely a pretty well polished, high-quality game and I'm sure others will have a ton of fun with it, but to me the combat system feels super-shallow. I set up a challenge to play the eikon mode literally one handed... and it turned out to be no challenge.


First time I've ever looked at a FF game and said to myself "this shit looks great" I have the demo ready for a day I have fuck all to do.


 turns out you have to make a good product, else if its just middling or bad you just have people a free trial as opposed to buying into the hype


If you’re into souls like games I hear the lies of p demo was pretty in depth


I hated the Eikon(?) fighting part and the seemingly endlessly screaming and beating of the phoenix character. Both lasted way too long, along with the boss battles as you whittle away tiny bits of health over a long period. Liked everything else though—looks gorgeous and the fighting in general feels good. I got no taste for the open world though which was disappointing. Overall a good demo.


If we're talking quality demos and trials, you'll be hard-pressed to top FF XIV's.

It gives you the entirety of the base game, the first expansion, the four classes added to the game in its first two years (Dark Knight, Astrologian, Machinist, and Ninja), and an extra playable race *for free*. Sure, it severely gimps a lot of features (this is done primarily to fend off RMT bots), but you get a ton of content and no time limit to enjoy it all.


Yeah FFXVI is a instant buy.  I was excited anyway  because of Yoshi being involved and the demo just sealed it.  

Purchase complete.


The FF16 demo actually removed all the hype I had


There are a few major problems:

1. They can cause people to [not](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-demos-can-hurt-sales-suggests-research/1100-6410863/) want to buy a game. 
2. Demos are often of older versions and perform worse than the retail product.
3. Sometimes they're set mid-game and were originally intended for showcasing the game at tradeshows where an employee would be on hand to explain the gameplay mechanics. These demos are often completely overwhelming to an individual home user.
4. Demos can be datamined, leading to developer/publisher losing control of the narrative surrounding their product.

Forspoken feels like a great example of a demo that hurt its sales potential. Even if the game reviewed well, the demo basically undermined any good press it got.


I'd already pre-ordered the game anyway, because the team behind it are absolutely worthy of having that trust put in them, but the demo is fantastic, and having it be the full prologue is great to suck a player into the plot of the game and leaving you wanting for more.

Adding the Eikonic challenge portion just so players can get a better look at how combat is after the early hours was a great choice too. 

You can see where the DMC pedigree comes in but it's tuned to still be an RPG at the core and not a character action game, where the skill ceilling is so much higher and can be intimidating for people not familiar with them. Although do play DMC5 to see how high that can go.

There seems to be nods to FXIV here and there, like the mini boss Dragoon having the same voice actor as Estinien, so that'll be fun to look for.


Legit thought this was Dark Souls for a second. Put a helmet on him, and I bet it would be hard to tell.


Lies of P also has a playable demo right now. It's fun!


Any demo that progresses into the main game is amazing.

I hated the fact that diablo 4 completely reset everything


Lies of P also just had a super long demo, and it's amazing.


Demo was absolutely insane! What a rare treat! Looking forward to more!


It's my first time playing final fantasy.... Is it really just cutscenes?..


It looks so incredibly good, I may actually buy a ps5 just for this game.


We need more demos but not more like this which was just a long tutorial. Most eastern games over explain everything.


This game is easily going to be GOTY if they can keep up the pacing and quality throughout the game. 

And I say that knowing full well just how good TOTK is. What Nintendo accomplished with that game and the physics is nothing short of incredible on the Switch hardware. 

But this game? This genuinely has the potential to be one of those cornerstone games everyone fondly remembers in 20-30 years like FF6, FF7, Chrono Trigger, etc. 

This demo was a better experience than 90% of full AAA games that have released this year.


It’s proven to stifle sales. There’s no incentive for developers to make them. 

A demo can definitely help some games sales, but it’s proven that it’s much more likely to go the opposite way, which is why so few do them anymore.


The only recent game I pre-ordered is Wo Long because I had a demo to make sure I like it before buying. I'm positive that I'm not the only one and that it's probably a very good business decision.


Well, first they need to advertise it better because I had no idea there was a FFXVI demo


>need demos like FFXVI

You mean more games need to be good, like FFXVI?

There are tons of demos out there. The difference here is the quality of FFXVI blowing our expectations out of the water.


I really dislike the "insta-warp to enemy" mechanic, and it works the same as in XV. For me action rpgs are all about careful positioning, but these ones just let you teleport to any enemy. While the enemies themselves mostly have to run at you. Feels cheap and unrewarding to me.


I didnt particularily like wo long.

But i still bought it and played through it because they went through the effort of putting a full first act demo with continous progress to let me experiance wether or not id like it first with no hiccups.

Ill probably do the same to 16 if it lets me try the pc port beforehand.


This isnt the first Square demo this generation, they already did with Dragonquest XI and Triangle Strategy


I haven’t played a demo since they were on discs and the last Final Fantasy I played was Lighting Returns. Might have to download this after reading all the comments.


My only concern is trophies.  If the save continues, will it unlock trophies earned during the demo when the full game is played?


More games need the live lore feature FFXVI has!


I was on the fence about this game and not really following along after being underwhelmed by recent FF releases... After playing that demo I immediately preordered. Looks, feels, sounds, and plays great. <3 Torgal


Nintendo does a lot of demos like that still, not for the big releases like Zelda, but Kirby and Metroid had a few demos like that, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon EX has a demo as you described, pretty sure Octopath Traveler has a demo on Switch like that, as does the second, and there are definitely more like that


Okay hear me out. I HEAR YOU. However, the only companies remotely capable of this are AAA games. Yes, this puts a new benchmark of quality on triple A games. However, no one else is going to be able to pull this off.

I'm sure just those two hours costed millions of dollars to make, and with the main industry of good games being made from indie developers, I don't see any more games of this quality coming out soon. So what I'm saying is I would love to see more game demos be like this, but realistically I don't see it happening until it becomes cheaper to produce with better technology.


All I can say is I really hope Square convinces Yoshi P to work on the main final fantasy games from now on rather than just FF14


They need to be widely available for everyone not just one group of gamers.


Question, im trying to hide myself from it, but is it like 14? As im a brand new 14 player and im absolutely falling in love with healer


It's thanks to the Forspoken demo that I found that It's not worth buying at any price, or even for free. Thanks Square Enix, for helping me save money.


FF16 has a demo? Playable right now on PC?? Sign me up! :D


the playstation exclusive shit is kinda bullshit


Isn't F2P mobile games a kind of demo before you decide to pay and progress within the game? The essence is the same primarily right?


Playing the demo,  I don't know why they didn't just place this game in the world of ivalice. Would of fit well.


I just..... am I literally the only one that hated all the QTE's, the constant unnecessary cutscenes, the bad dialogue, the stupid swearing, the weird rail gun section, being told you defeated an enemy only to be killed by it in a cutscene.


Agreed. It made me change my mind about buying it. Ill wait for PC, the quality is piss poor with all the blur and shimmering and 30 FPS is a no go for me. I didnt buy a PS5 to go back to previous gen. Performance mode doesnt sustain 60FPS either and it looks prety bad. Also the gameplay was too easy. Inb4 generic r/games gamer downvotes because OMG FF AWESOME HOW CAN U NOT LIKE SOMETHING THE BIG CORPORATIONS GIVE U.


True. Canceled my preorder because of it lol


I already pre-ordered it last week because i love final fantasy, but i haven't played the demo yet because it's 2 hours long and even tho i could transfer the save to the final game i would just play it again because i would have to spend 1 week without playing it and would lose the timing of where i left off in the demo... But i'm glad to know the game is amazing like it should be, just a little concerned with the performance mode but as people said the demo is from a prior version so i got hope!


The problem is FF14 demo is longer than 90% of full games.


I just completed God of war ragnarok and after playing it i have to say this demo didnt impress me much. Imo the combat was lacking depth and boss fights were rather boring hit and dash combos. But maybe when you level up the game gets better. I think i wait some reviews before i buy.


Is FFXVI story any good? Do the characters feel infantile as in FFVII remake?


More games need to be mmorpgs like FFXIV


And it's nice because it is a bit tiring/boring havi g to replay the same section again.


that's why my wife stopped the Diablo 4 beta. "You mean we have to start all over? Screw that!"


I think it would be better if all the games had a so-called DEMO. What do you think? Isn't it better when that's what happened?


[removed]


Oh so you HAVE heard of the critically-acclaimed Final Fantasy XIV that includes A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, AND Stormblood trial?


Agreed. I was instantly sold at the beginning w/ the Gandalf vs the Balrog-like intro. Knew I was in for a ride at that point.


Only thing that bothered me was the movement outside of battle. Felt like I was floating around





I was curious about 16 before the demo, but only because I regularly play 14 where Yoshi-P is the director/producer. When I saw the opening credits, I realized that Soken (composer for 14's music) and Koji Fox (translator for 14) were involved. I've seen all 3 of these men on multiple live letters and interviews for 14 related things. So that piqued my interest at the start. But once the end screen popped up, I was immediately hit with a sense of, "I need more." I immediately ran to the living room to tell my partner that we're getting the game.


Wait the demo is out?


Can't wait to play it.

FF is a franchise I've only dipped my toe in a few times. But my childhood memories of playing FFX will forever be a dragon I'm chasing.


Like the forspoken demo killed any consideration I had for that game


This. Demos are only viable if you're very confident in your product. Otherwise you ride the preorders and eat the bad reviews.


It also costs dev time and money making a demo, which is a separate build. They have to consider if the added expense of making a demo will lead to additional sales.

A lot of games are open-world and complex, so it's not easy to just slice a level out of a game and wrap it as a standalone application.

In the good old days of demo discs and magazines, a lot of hype came from demos and printed articles. These days reviews are often up day 1 of release, alongside playthroughs on YouTube. There's not so much of a need for publishers to get consumers convinced at release time.


There were about three different spots in the Dragon Quest XI demo where I went, “surely **this** is where the demo ends, right?” before the demo actually ended. IMO the best and most generous demo in recent years, and also one of my fav games of all time.


Just responding to say I love your name - Lufia 2 deserves more love


> Dragon Quest XI

Man, I love that game. My five year old daughter calls it "monster bonk".


Try the indie game Crystal Project. The demo gets you 10-20 hours and progress transfer over. It's a really great open-world job-based jrpg with platforming elements.


Was it until the dragon when you escape? Must've been even further, just how long in was it?


Same for the Dragon Quest builders 2 demo. You had a really clear picture of the game by the time it was over


The new one, right?


Note to self 2: never mind. It's only for ps5 :(


oh you mean the demo that gave me PTSD yesterday?


No nearly every final fantasy is its own separate story with different settings and characters.


The only connections to the prior games are some recurring themes like some music, monster designs, NPC names, items, etc that they all share. There is no story connection whatsoever. You'd be fine.


You may have a better experience than a lot of the longtime fans not able to look past their own nostalgia and conceptions of what final fantasy “is/should be” 

As a long time fan of the series I’m extremely hyped and loved the demo. I really think Yoshi-P and team have pulled it off


As others say, the only thing that links FF games are recurring names, monster designs and some reoccurring concepts. 

It's an anthology series where each main entry is it's own world with its own characters and story. 

How these features appear in each game is completely different. For example, each Final Fantasy has a character called Cid, but the character themselves are different each time.


This thread is literally about a demo. A demo would probably be a good thing to play before seeing if you want to buy something.


Not really, it uses the crystal plot device from the older games, and the summons, which are already a staple in the franchise, are extremely important to the games plot, but it’s nothing you’d actually need to play an older game to understand


100% agreed.


Square have been doing it for maybe a decade now, with Bravely Default games. Atlus did it for Etrian Odyssey games on 3DS too.


With platforms offering refunds and the speed at which reviews can be spread around, even if a game didn't have a demo, it would still flop. At least with a demo, you can hope that even if someone decides to buy it they won't refund it. There is an audience for Forspoken, though it might not be as large as hoped.


Its kinda how Yoshi-P works, hes totally fine with doing things over and over again, extending deadlines etc. just to make sure that they're actually releasing the game they want to. He also really cares about a games' community :) he did great work bringing FF14 from essentially trash to being one of the best MMO's out there.


Agreed. I'm on my third playthrough 😂


that and SF6 demos were good. I'll be buying Lies of P. Now I hope Armored Core 6 will have a demo.


I wasn't even thinking about this game, but after giving demo a shot I'll probably buy it on release or soon after. It tickles my Bloodborne love in a good way.


That one also runs amazingly well on the Steam Deck. I suspect they have Decks at the studio and are heavily optimizing the game for it


I didn't like it at all (full transparency, I don't like soulsborn games). I wanted to like it, I love the aesthetic and I think the concept sounds amazing. I just hated the combat from the first enemy. Fallen order and Jedi Survivor are the only soulslike games I've ever liked. I much prefer GoW/GoWR type combat, as soon as I saw a stamina bar I knew that I wasn't going to like the game.


I'm 40, finished the demo yesterday, and I still haven't emotionally recovered.


Yeah my partner and his brother were in the room while I was playing but they were both occupied (phone/tablet) and chatting with each other at the beginning. Towards the end they made me take off my headphones so we could all hear it and were completely silent and transfixed for the last 30 minutes of the demo.


Based on this team's track record with XIV, I'm betting by the end of it all, this won't even be the 5th most emotionally impactful moment in XVI.


I agree I’m still on hardware that is last gen. Definitely buying a ps5 mainly just for this


[deleted]


Yes, it's one of the best demos I've ever played.


Yes, and it's incredible


Demo totally wowed me as well. Especially that doozy of an ending. I *need* to know what happened, lol.


Demo is 1.01. I think. The current version is 1.03.


yeah I usually prefer playing quality mode but the motion blur made it basically unplayable


Oh man, you missed out. I wouldn’t recommend playing the old games now because obviously they will look and probably feel outdated (although the stories are timeless), but most of them were great for their times. I had a blast playing 7, 8, 9, 10 & 12. I recently watched recap videos of the stories in these games and it brought up all the feelings. 

I didn’t like 13 and 15 as much, but I’m very much looking forward to this one!


Especially big games that are a big investment like JRPGs


Thr parry window is a bit tricky but satisfying once you get it down. Combat reminds me of a hybrid between Dragon's Dogma and Devil May Cry. Looking forward to whatever they have cooked up for combat trials.


Yes combat is real time


It's action RPG - combat design was made by the guy who did Dragon's Dogma & Devil May Cry


It truly seems like something special. I'm on my 3rd run for the demo, so I'd imagine I'm going to get lost in FFXVI the next several weeks when it drops.


Me too. Just got to Shadowbringers in FFXIV & I'm glad to see the same team bringing the magic to the single player experience.


Yeah, FF16 has a Game of Thrones vibe & I'm here for it. Finally a Final Fantasy that feels geared towards the adults who grew up with the games the past 30 years.


I played and beat FFXV. Loved it. 

That said, I enjoyed this demo as much, if not more than FFXV.

I think it's designed to be as engaging as possible. 

Yoshi-P said he wanted people to feel like they're on a roller-coaster.


XVI is on another level and cannot be compared to anything that came before. Play the demo and you will see.


Thanks! Photo mode is kinda hidden. You gotta navigate to the Attributes tab then press the ps5 touch pad.


The different between graphic and fps focus insane tbh. I love how good the graphics are but for a smooth gameplay experience play it on performance mode its a shame but how much I move my camera in these games I was forced to.


Yeah, should be on the PS store page for FFXVI


Yes you just have to click on the game then click on the 3 dots to see Demo but it’s there and amazing.


Right? Only comparable demos that hooked me this hard were the Metal Gear Solid 2 and Shadow of the Colossus demos.


/r/FFXVI 

We were losing our minds over there


My kid and I have a bet going. She is taking tears of the kingdom and I am taking ff16


Blew my mind as well. I'm currently on my 3rd playthrough and can't get enough. Photo mode is 🔥, too.


Yeah, it's a prologue, and your progress carries to the main game.


The demo is basically the first chapters of the game, and you can pick it up from there with the actual game. There is a separate segment afterward you can play to get a feel for higher level gameplay. That bit is fairly spoiler light, but obviously will have some.


That beginning part took me back to the first time I saw Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in the theater. Instantly loved it.


Play the demo again. Use the popup lore button thingy this time.


This is the first one that has a more adult tone. Which is one of the reasons I love it. FF12 kinda did as well, but it was more teen centered, whereas this one is rated M.


No but the spin off games often are. Particularly FF Tactics, FF Zero, and FF Crisis Core


Love that archetype as well. Witcher 3 was my favorite game before Death Stranding dropped. FF16 might knock DS to #2 😂


So many people (including me) bought Zone of the Enders just to get that demo disc.

And yeah, no other demo compares. That demo was absolutely mindblowing at the time.


Agreed on the M rating. Final Fantasy has been around for 30+ years. Those of us who grew up with the series are adults. It's great to see both the gameplay evolve & for it to take on a more adult tone. The entire FFXVI team should take a bow. If the demo is just tip of the iceberg, we're in for a ride.


Lies of P looks pretty awesome. Demo sold me. And  I hear ya on the sale... 2023 is the Year of the Gamer with how many good games have and are coming out.


Me too, lol. They're in a box somewhere with my PS2  and copy of the original Shadow of the Colossus. And I agree, the demo is outstanding.


No problem and enjoy!


Yes. The demo is literally the first two hours of the game so it can easily be transferred over.


From my understanding, yes. 👍


Agreed.  I need to know what happened after the way it ended. Totally invested after the superb demo.


When companies know their product is good they're not afraid to show it!


I think FF16 is PS5 only, not available on PS4.


Most AAA games release half finished so the demos would hurt them lol. But if we as customers demanded demos maybe it would make them finish the games /copium


Yes, loved the demo. It wasn't anywhere on my radar and that demo sold me on the game.


For now, I think PS5 has exclusivity for 6 months.


Every numbered FF is diferent and a complete new game , you can pick any FF with number and you are going to understood everything ,


It's more like Zelda. Each game is its own story, but there are similarities in terms of the world. 

Example: Final Fantasy always has similar enemy types, characters named Cid / Biggs / Wedge, epic orchestral scores, and a logo designed by Yoshitaka Amano.


There's multiple combos you can do with the different abilities you get. The demo has a 2nd mode where you're further along in the game. Parrying is available from the start. 👍


Good point. I read about some legendary demo/trial player who got all jobs to 60 and did pretty much everything you could do for free in FF14.


Having just gotten to Shadowbringers in FF14, I figured Yoshi-P would deliver with FF16, but there's always that inkling of doubt. 

All doubt has been erased after playing the demo.


It felt pretty stripped of rpg elements to me. The sphere grid looked very limited.


Is an FF they have loong cutscenes at this point is stample , but yup you had a lot gameplay too they are usuually long games and this one they said is like 35 hours long


There are a lot of cutscenes in the beginning to do worldbuilding yeah, but in general it is a story heavy game. You can probably expect it to be styled like a Sony 1st party game where there's a setpiece, gameplay, followed by cinematic transitions, with cinematics after boss fights.


TBH, it might just be worth it. On that same note, I'm thinking about picking up a Series X just for Starfield.


It's the main reason I bought mine. 2nd reason was the FF7 remake (since I got the PS5 near launch).

The reason I bought a PS1 was to play FFVII, so I feel like it's come full circle 27 years later.


the pacing was so fucking slow in this, I feel like im going crazy having people say this could be GOTY above zelda


It’s sad that their takeaway from that isn’t “we should make better games, so demos don’t hurt sales” but rather “let’s just not let them play until we have their money. Then it doesn’t matter if it’s sucks”


God, this community is obnoxious. It’s always these like edgy teens going, “if u dunt release a demo, maybe u juz cant make good games”. It just screams of weird entitlement. 

Demo’s are a significant time waster for developers with very little benefit. If you are awarded the extra development time they might be viable but most devs are not awarded such time… they are trying to make the entire game work instead of splintering off the team to fully polish and bug fix a demo. 

Plus there are game trials or tests for most games released now anyways that just use the final release build and turn off after a set time. 

Demo’s are a luxury only afforded to some. And every dev is trying to make a good game. Hate this new gamer mentality that developers are out to get them.


Bro, they made a 2 hour showcase exclusively for this game a couple of days ago with a live audience.


Well after FF15 expectations were pretty low. This was an incredible step up for the series in terms of both direction and gameplay. It’s dark and more mature yet still has those FF elements that make the series. TBD if the game will end up overall being good but the demo was impressive.


If you're talking about gameplay, then no. 14 is a traditional MMO, 16 is single player real time action combat a la Devil May Cry, Dragons Dogma, Nier Automata, etc.

The world/lore, however, is similar in that it feels like a Japanese take on traditional medieval European fantasy. Kind of like the first five games, only much, much darker in tone. It definitely earns it's M rating.


It has nods to FF14 for sure. Definitely on one part I dont want to spoil. 

As a level 90 Gunbreaker who just got to Shadowbringers, I think you'll like it if you like FF14.


I've only gotten past the initial tutorial against the house guard or whatever he was, and through a few cutscenes until you have control in the courtyard. I've so far had a similar experience where I'm really not a fan of the pacing so far. The flash forward to the Phoenix fight certainly *looks* impressive but you're just mashing triangle. Then we get a ton of cutscenes interspersed with like 3 areas where I can walk forward for about 20 seconds before the next cutscene. I don't know anyone, I don't know the conflict, I don't  *get* anything yet. And I know in media res can be an effective story telling technique, but I'm not drawn in except for the spectacle. At this point I'm kind of thinking "I'll just watch a cutscene compilation".

I think if it is was just intro cutscene flash and spectacle - shots of Phoenix fight, shots of Titan / ice mage fight, shots of ground war, shots of this clandestine group running around, hide the tattoo on Clives face -THEN went right into combat tutorial, I'd be much more into things so far. Everybody shut the fuck up, I'm sure there's going to be a billion lines of dialogue it's final fantasy. I don't need to watch miss "definitely not a scheming femme fatale" hump mister brick shithouse. The demo feels like it needs an editor.

I dunno, I'm on your side so far, this pacing is WAY hella off.


Bad dialogue? Wtf. The voice acting is insanely good imo.


SAME, I feel everyone is pulling a prank or something, the game is such a slog and every bit of it feels as generic as possible, the fact that anyone is even saying that this could be GOTY blows my mind after playing the demo, the demo felt longer than any game I've played it was such a slog, they put more thought into God of War's door art than they did this entire video game.


Did you play the eikonic battle?

The combat was lacking depth because it's the first 2 hours of the game. It would be awful if you started out with everything and add zero challenge. Did you upgrade the abilities too?

Honestly the intro to this was better than ragnarock imo, and I love ragnarock.


It's still Japanese, but feel way, way more mature. And not just in the blood and boobies kinda way.


Yes, it's one of the reasons I liked it. Feels like Final Fantasy finally "grew up" with a more adult tone.

Story is an intricate as Game of Thrones and there's an "Active Time Lore" system that let's you pause and read about who/what/where/why to prevent feeling lost.


Absolutely not


Honestly im probably going to start a new game on release just to replay the starting sections. It was just *that* good


I don't think that will be the case for this game. I'm 100% replaying from start when I get the game. The prologue is soooooo good. I wasn't bored at all. I'm thinking about replaying the demo again.


You won’t have to, save transfers over.

The only thing that doesn’t save is the Eikonic Challenge, since it’s a vertical slice originally used in previews.


Honestly I haven't even started playing D4 yet because I already capped out in the beta.  Really killed any incentive for myself to actually play lmao


Just wait until she learns about seasons.


I wasn't even sure I was going to buy it, but after the demo I preordered immediately


I was hoping the demo would temper my expectations, but it just fueled the fire lol


[removed]


I'd not seen any trailers before the demo, then went and watched them afterwards.

Oh my god, not only do Kaiju battles seem like a huge part, but there are definitely some inspirations taken from Attack on Titan, I'm so hyped for it!


Said the exact same thing to a buddy. The movement wasn’t *bad* it just didn’t feel *right*.  Outside of battle you basically glide and slip around like there’s no sense of traction or friction in the world. Your footfalls don’t actually matter, because you just slide over everything. 

That said, that was an amazing demo and I’m super excited for the game now. The movement in battle feels good, so as long as it’s just the overworld travel, I can get over it. ^though ^I ^do ^wish ^it ^was ^better


For me the occasional frame rate issues (in performance mode) and the motion blur that can’t be turned off were a little concerning, but I’m still going to get the full game. If they can patch it to allow removing motion blur and reduce graphics setting to perform at a constant 60fps like FF7 Remake Intergrade, it could easily be GOTY


The jumping looks real bad, it feels very out of place with how smooth the rest of the game is.


But not the ridiculously linear path to objectives or obscene combo timing that take a quarter of a second to input queue?

I mean, I’m okay with linear games but holy shit this is literally just walking from one room to the next while occasionally doing a QTE to open a door.

Then doing combos and delaying inputs for animation is not even in the realm of possibility.  The combat doesn’t feel fluid because I’m pressing buttons in sequence **before** the actions and not during/on time.

And btw, you’re not wrong in the floaty movement.  Watch your feet as you walk.  They *ice-skate* over the surface and your body moves faster than the animations.


So after Heavensward a good chunk of the FF14 team split off and started work on FF16.

The three you mention all do double duty but a lot of people moved from 14 to 16. 

Most notably, the scenario writer of Heavensward is the writer of FF16.


Platinum games also helped with the game, more specifically the producer and his team that did nier automata with Yoko taro and saito.

Kingdom hearts studio also worked on the game.

My own speculation is that platinum did the hunt bosses (intro card for hunt bosses is the same like in bayonetta) and the flying sections + the one where the boss is standing infront of you and just punching down its like in the first nier automata boss fight.


Kh team is pretty diverse so i assume they also helped with boss segments. 

This was all mentioned in the ff16 event hosted by square enix, they had panels with the director,composer and the combat designer 

https://www.youtube.com/live/SNXD3J3vmqw


Oh and also 14’s “demo”. Honestly it’s not even a demo, it’s the full game, minus 3 expansions and a couple of other features, mainly social ones


Soken and Shoji Meguro are two composer I would buy anything they have a hand in. Even if the game is not that good you know you gonna be in for a banger.


I’ve been very cautious about FF since Sakaguchi left and especially after XIII, but I had complete faith in Yoshi P on this one and it looks like he knocked it our of the park. I hope he stays at the helm for a long time (though I hope he shakes up the setting and themes from time to time).


Same here. I so wanted that game to be good, but after playing it I gave it a pass.

Meanwhile the FF16 demo took my hype to even greater levels.


And if you can believe it, the full game is even worse than the demo from what I’ve seen.


The game is long as fuck, easily 200 hours to complete a playthrough. So it makes sense they could do a long demo.


Agreed. Immediately bought the game when the demo ended as I was so into it. And the game picks up seamlessly once you buy the full thing.


Huh, there's a demo for that game? On Steam?


[removed]


[deleted]


Yeah. It's insane. I downloaded the demo at like 5pm thinking I'd play it for 30min-1hr and if I like it, buy it. At 1030 I was still playing the damn demo. There's no excuse for refunding that game. You get more than ample opportunity to learn if it's for you.


They'll eventually bring it to PC but dont expect something till next year. Yoshi-P (one of the leads of the game) said the exclusive period is only 6 months but because Sony had helped with optimization for the PS5 it'll take longer to port it over to other hardware.


And chocopos(?)


There’s also Biggs and Wedge **wedged** in as NPC’s, cause the devs were massive Star Wars fans back in the day.


To be fair I don't think he's fine with stuff like extending deadlines, he looked so upset when endwalker for ff14 got delayed. But he also gets it's worth it to put out a finished product that he knows works. I remember I think he said he tests a lot of stuff himself to make sure it's good.

I got a lot of respect for him, his team, and everything they put out. (even if he plays favorite with black mage)


I’m really the revamped movement in AC6. The verticality is interesting.


Yeah, I was surprised by how well it plays and how cool it looks. Normally soulsbournes are more in the janky department, but this one was amazing.


The "demo" is literally just the first 3 hours of the actual game and progress saves if you buy the game.


pc demo?!


Yeah, but will that fix the FPS drops to 30-40 at a guess, with plenty of stutters included too?  I’d be surprised and it’s very off putting to me.


funny enough the guy that made the combat of those 2 games is making the combat in ff16.


I’ll have to try the demo, I wasn’t really a fan of how they handled FF15


Oh nice Dragons Dogma had great combat


Dang, no wonder why the combat felt a lot like DmC: Devil May Cry.


Ohhhh that’s a great expansion.  I personally like endwalker more, but I’m in the minority.


I enjoyed the characters of XV and the exploring a bit, setting up camp etc. I couldn't even recall what the story was about. I've become a dirty casual..


Ok good looking out, I'ma download it when I get off


 The thing that really stands out to me is that obviously “demos” are traditionally to get a taste of the gameplay out there and sway some people.

I’ve never played a demo that had such an intense emotional hook, they made me care more about these characters in an hour than I have about any character in any retail game I’ve played in recent memory. 

It’s unbelievably cohesive and honestly a work of art in its own right lol.


The Zelda name will carry TOTK to GOTY.... It shouldn't, but that's the unfortunate reality. Although Elden Ring, much to my surprise and excitement, beat out Ragnarok last year, so maybe people are starting to appreciate real quality a bit more.


Didn't even realize there's a photo mode! 90% of my photos will be of Torgal or Clives ass.


Don’t tempt me, you devil!


Omg you remember in the demo when that guy just straight up picked up ol girl and started to motorboat her titties I was like oh wowww…


My Ps2 plus Shadown of The Colossus are behind the TV along with FF 7,8,9,X,X-2 & 12 other Ps2 games lol


Yeah same, went from not on my radar to what will likely be a preorder or day 1 purchase


Oh man I am jealous.  You get to enjoy one of the best expansions ever made for a MMO.  Followed by hands down the best expansion ever made with Endwalker.

Enjoy that ride it was a real treat.


It's the same system as FFVII remake. It's a simple ability tree, not a sphere grid, which was what defined a character's would be class role in FFX.

It's very much an action RPG. Stats still play a key role. DMC has zero visible stats whatsoever. 

The game is pretty much an evolution of FFVII Remake gameplay wise, just without the pseudo ATB system which is replaced by cooldown times on skills. This is to be expected as the dev team works primarily on FFXIV and they wanted the gameplay to be smooth and fast.


The reason I got a ps1 was all those dank ass demo disks


I have a general “good faith” hope that these developers are doing the best they can with the resources they have.  It gets harder and harder to reconcile that point sometimes, mostly when these games are under lock and key until they already have your money by using the FOMO techniques.


So many people nowadays have that victim mentality. Everything is happening to them because the world is out to get them. It’s exhausting.


4-5 hours, in fact! They have done a lot of advertising for the game but it seems to not reach a lot of people still, unfortunately.


...and if you didn't know about the event? We are constantly connected to the gaming space, but there is a huge chunk of people who aren't.


I just finished the 1000 sighs. 

I was a big WoW fan before I lost my desktop in a fire about 2 years ago. And my friend at work brought me to a company that's really nice and she had been helping me learn the game. 

So im not far through and I'm loving the challenge of Arrs dungeons since I'm still low level (Execept the waking sands. Fuck her). I'm trying to find the wolf pup currently. I've done so many side quests I've hit level 30 already haha..


what the hell are you talking about


Ffxv demo and the actual full game at the same chapter were slightly different, the full in better... definitely replay without transferring


I recommend playing it again.  I'm noticing things I didn't the first time around.


I agree. I'm replaying the opening in case I missed any details.


^ This 100%.

I got done with the demo and the Eikon challenge, and went back to playing Diablo 4 (which I love) and went, "Hmmm, well, now I'm kinda bored here." lol


I personally don't like to replay hours of game when I haven't beaten the game yet. I want to jump to stuff I haven't experienced yet.


for most good RPG im doing at least 2 playthrough for each language.


we've really been enjoying the game. I recommend it.


It'll take like 2 or 3 hours. Just do it now.


May as well save the full game for that, it comes out in about a week. You can breeze through the demo pretty quickly.


Imma guess you are referring to the God character Titan who has been a reoccurring character in final fantasy games since ff3 which was made back in 1990. 

Attack on titan was not a inspiration for the character lol.

The inspiration for a titan character in both video game/anime prob came from Greek mythology.


That was v1.01, state of play was already 1.03, let's hope in better...instabought anyway


Weirdly, I only noticed the movement issue in the initial "future" segment. The rest felt fine to me. Not sure if it was just there or my brain was too busy to notice afterwards.


It looks like they were trying to go for the DMC run. Seems like a somewhat easy fix and it didn't bother me that much.


Yes! That's the other thing that bugged me. Why can't we turn off motion blur? It's the only game I've seen that has it where it can't be turned off.


If a little stuttering can keep a game from being GOTY, then Zelda is screwed.


Dude it’s a 2hr demo to get people past the intro.


I'm the same man. Kh2, bayonetta, dmc, I don't like combat where your button pressing is not 1:1 with the combos on screen, feels like the game is playing itself and to me it's much more satisfying when each attack is in line with what I'm doing. Like Ninja gaiden, god of war- fighting games in general.


Same! 13 was the first in the series that I did not enjoy, at all. I still haven't touched 15 because of how I felt about 13. But Yoshi-P comes across as very genuine and passionate about whatever he's working on. Seeing him come into a live letter stream nearly crying while apologizing to the players showed how much he cares. And his reaction to Soken announcing the battle with cancer was heartbreaking. I'll get around to 15 at some point, but I'm really looking forward to 16.


Hahaha ff16 had the opposite effect on me 😂

Had little interest in it based on the doll looking character models and dmc combat but the storytelling and even the gameplay grabbed me by the balls


I platinumed the game and played it really slow, took me 180h


[removed]


That is nuts. Yeah, best demo by far.

Ff16 one is really close though. It lets you play the first 2-3 hours of the game and play a level later on with lots of abilities to get a feel for gameplay. It's pretty damn good for a demo.


Wasn't it all the way through the desert area with Sylvando? I may be wrong.


Bro, thank you! I've never played a dragon quest game and seen this. It instantly had my attention and looked fun.


If it takes a while it takes a while. ff7 remake is super smooth on pc *tips hat*


Chocobo, and yes they are there in practically every game.


Yeah instead of "totally fine" i could've worked it better, like "willing"


The dodge is a little jank. But it appears to be one of the best soulslikes out there if that quality holds up for the whole game.


The game is a PS5 exclusive


[deleted]


They also recruited Platinum games and the Kingdom Hearts team to help with the combat. Literally a who's who roster of action combat devs.


Definitely try it out, I enjoyed it so much more than XV’s combat.


XVI is being made by a different team from XV. The XVI team are generally well regarded for the quality of their work (they're the team behind FF14's revival).


Definitely do, I haven't enjoyed any FF that much since they swapped away from turn based combat and FF16 became a day 1 purchase for me after trying the demo.


Don't go in expecting that level. In the demo, the combat was somewhat bland, at least to me. Other people seem to like it, but I don't think anyone would call it deep (at least what's in the demo itself).


Nah. XV was awful. You don’t remember anything because it was an incomprehensible mess.


😂😂😂

It's a bit hidden. You gotta navigate to the Attributes screen, then hit the touch pad on the PS5 controller.


Yeah as a fan of the series since the original FF7 dropped that was definitely a first. 😂😂


Awesome, looking forward to playing through them. 🙌


I really don't see the similarities to FF7 remake. In FF7 every weapon for each character had 4 tiers of upgrades. FF16 has one ability circle for one controllable character and I didn't see any stat upgrades except base equipment stats. The Eikon trees are tiny. No mana management and a completely revamped and simplified magic system. Way less variety in abilities and no sprint. And for some reason, the fact that you can't break shit in the environment irked me lol. Like, no crates to loot?? It's a very different game and it's definitely toned down in terms of progression. The only things that felt like final fantasy to me were the music, exploring stillwater, and the Eikons exisitng.


I think the rank and file developers who are actively making the game care. Like most places, I think the management group is where the problems lie. A focus on profits above all else.


There are lots of youtube channels talking about. Even mainstream channels like IGN has multiple videos. Or your idea of advertising is billboards on reddit like Diablo did?


How do you know this?


The FFXV demo wasn't even IN the game that got released. You played as Noctis as a kid, then he morphed into an adult towards the end of the demo and you battled some monsters in Insomnia outside the palace. There were no chapters in the demo, not even a lick of story. I know this because I still have the ffxv demo on my ps4 and my daughter played it before starting FFXV herself.


The conversation between Joshua's mother and her handmaids in the courtyard?


I plan to replay it just in case there's any trophies in the first 2 hours.


I'll get to it...at some point. Probably after final fantasy lol.


I'm aware that Titan has been in the series before, and that titans are from Greek mythology. I meant in the sense that only certain people (Dominants) can transform into Eikons is very similar to AoT, and the aesthetic/design seemed like a cool mix between the colossal & armoured titans.


FF always updates it’s legacy monsters/aeons and it’s not surprising that they took inspiration from AoT for the Titan revamp.


It was definitely there the whole time lol Noticed it first thing running around as Wyvern, experimented with it as young Clive (running in tight circles was ridiculous, almost as ridiculous as how tiny they made the jump in the city for some reason), still felt it in eikonic challenge


It’s a bit weird considering FF7R:I had amazing, per-object motion blur that you actually don’t notice because it looks good without making you feel woozy. Most people didn’t even realize that game had motion blur.


Yeah TotK performance is bad. I’m about halfway through the game but I’m considering restarting it with an emulator. At least it stutters on a Switch, not a damn PS5


My issue with 13 and 15 was they had a certain shallowness, a style over substance, if you will. It’s not uncommon for JRPGs to have tropey characters and what not, but FF always had an endearing heart at the center, some kind of universal message, and those 2 games just felt sort of hollow.


Same. I never give a fuck about ff but the demo made it seem pretty good overall. Combat still seems super basic, but that's not always bad.


Damn, sorry to hear. Not for everyone I suppose, what did you think of it in comparison to FF7R if you played that one? Did you like FF7R?


Back in the day I remember open world games on the Xbox 360 having most of the games as demo for a time limit.


Crystal Project wasn't Square, was it? I thought it was indie dev.


Live A Live had a great demo too.


[removed]


It is a very typical classic style jrpg. It's a lot of fun but can get repetitive. It is also very long. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit and glad I got it, but I did begin fatiguing before the end.


FF7 remake is broken as all hell on PC. Hardly any graphic options, no ultra wide, insane studders in Wall Market. I absolutely loved it, however I'd never call it smooth even on my 8700k and 3080.


timed exclusive i think


oh, ok then. =/


the game will come out on pc in about a year after launch


Because performance problems like this are far too often not fixed before launch, so yeah, from that experience it would be totally unsurprising unfortunately.  I really hope they do improve it a lot but I have plenty of reason from many past game releases that’s not a sure thing at all.  I hope I’m wrong with this one.


Oh, snap, the Platinum team is on it, too?  Yoshi-P Avenger'ed an RPG super team around this game.


Did you try the second half of the demo with three separate Eikons available? Gives a much better idea of the depth, but it is a bit easy because you aren't supposed to have those abilities at that point in the story.


Yeah I’m not expecting too much after how much I disliked 15’s combat


what do you mean? a 30 year time skip made complete sense


Make sure to take it slow and enjoy them both! Don't rush them if you can help it. :)


XV


There are 2 demos.

There technically is story in the platinum demo. Small detail to the story,  but its still a story detail. The demo is a "dream" within a coma


Trophies will pop once you load your save, as they always do with Square's demos. So if that's your only reason to replay it then you won't have to.


I played the beta twice with separate characters and the beginning of the game was quite a chore doing it again but once you get past it the game is quite good


Yeah i was mostly disappointed by how utterly basic it is, but it felt good so that counted for smth


I think they’re saying XVI demo changed their mind positively?


I was saying ff16 demo had the opposite effect of porspoken demo. I.e. sold me on the game :)


Ps: i love ff7 remake. Even after ff16 demo i much prefer that style of combat and world


The one who said that is just a bot copying posts from elsewhere in the thread.


Nah, Fam. The best demo is definitely Final Fantasy XIV's. I've already sunk 200 hours into it, and I ain't even through the Heavensward expansion yet.


What?

What did they already do?


And Octopath Traveler 1 and 2.   
Though, FF16 would be the first flagship Squeenix property in recent years to have that type of demo. 

I don't think the FF7R demo let you transfer progress, the demo mission being so short.


OMG NO ULTRA WIDE 

BROKEN AS HELL😭🥵🤬😖


The game is broken because it has no ultra wide...


I don't have an ultra wide screen, so I can't comment on that.

I think I've only had some studders in wall market, but my PC is now ~ 3 years old so no i attributed it to that.

So while I'll agree it might not be as smooth for everyone per my experience shows, I'd argue "broken as hell" is a bit of an exaggeration as well. The absence of graphic options is not the same as something being broken.

I bought it again on pc as I don't have a ps5 and  i fear the next parts won't release on ps4 anymore ( as the yuffie dlc didn't release on ps4 ).

It runs very similar on my pc compared to my ps4. Maybe I'm just less picky around graphics. :)


You'll probably get in on PC a year after release.


I think that comes with trusting the dev team. Yoshida runs FFXIV really well so I'm confident that he and his team did not overlook these problems in XVI


The demo is from a year ago, the devs are so confident in the game that they say there will be no day 1 patch. If the current build ran like the demo there is no way they would act like that.


Curious what compelled you to wonder how much he played the demo


That was the most disappointing part for me. Switching Eikons switches a few of your abilities, only a few were really useful for that part of the game. The sphere grid is very small. It kind of made me sad because before FF15, FF had tons of abilities, gear, upgrades, and build progression. FF16 seems stripped of rpg elements to me. The combat has nothing on Dragon's Dogma, and doesn't live up to DMC if that's what it was going for.


This has been made by an entirely different studio within Square-Enix. This has been made by the people that recreated FF14 and turned it from a complete failure to the biggest competitor to WoW.

Whereas the FF15 devs went on to make Forspoken...


Was it really that long? I do remember a skip and they had beards but were otherwise the same. I vaguely remember the gameplay took a massive downgrade after said time skip as well. Just felt like a slog to play.


Oh really? I haven't tried it with any other games. But I think I've kind of talked myself into reexperiencing from the start the day of release any way. Not like it'll take too long to get caught up


Oh okay, the previous poster said that playing the ff16 demo took their hype to new levels and he replied saying that the demo had the opposite effect for him. I think he replied to the wrong comment.


Just one example of what was wrong with the port. The studdering was way worse.


As evidenced by the fact [that there are no plans for a day one patch.](https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2023/05/22/a-day-one-patch-for-final-fantasy-16-is-not-currently-planned)


There’s no way they wouldn’t act like that, they want their game to sell.


The second section of the demo has much better combat than the main section, which is a prologue.


Just because I've seen a lot of people who were hoping for combat depth ignore the combat focused second half, so I wondered if that was the case here.


[deleted]


It was "only" ten years. But yeah. 15 had a troubled upbringing.


It was "just" 10 Years. And you can literally sum it up as "The Hero got Ocarina of Time'd", because the in-universe reason for it was exactly the same "You aren't ready yet to beat the Bad Guy"


I've imported my saves of Theatrhythm and Valkyrie Elysium and both of them popped all the trophies that I would have had unlocked in the demo, so I doubt this will be any different. 

I'll probably also replay it despite that, the opening was so great I don't mind experiencing it again!


Everyone knows that the opposite of good is good!


Finally, a system that could handle the raw power of F-Zero


Day 1 purchase if it is also a "Switch" type console.

The hybrid model is unbeatable.

If it aint broke, don't fix it.


fyi back in 2016 Tom Phillips was the first writing in detail about the then upcoming new Nintendo console (NX) which was released as Switch. So they have a credible track record 

https://www.eurogamer.net/nx-is-a-portable-console-with-detachable-controllers

https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoNX/comments/4uoi2m/nintendo_nx_is_a_portable_console_with_detachable/


Just don't name it like the 3DS line nintendo.

New Nintendo Switch Widescreen OLED


There's some[additional informaiton in VGC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-showed-switch-2-demos-at-gamescom/): " Another VGC source claimed that Nintendo showcased Epic’s impressive The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 tech demo – originally released to showcase the power of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021 – running on target specs for its next console.

The demo is said to have been running using Nvidia’s DLSS 3.5 upscaling technology, with advanced ray tracing enabled and visuals comparable to Sony and Microsoft’s current-gen consoles. "

Okay, this is huge. The original NVidea leak was from two years ago and at most I was hoping for DLSS 2.0, but with Switch sales still strong over the last 18 months and only now slowing, it looks like they've gone for a more advanced chip.

It feels like the Switch 2 could be a PS4 Pro style console, albeit with more more modern chipset.  


Edit. Eurogamer has taken out the DLSS 3.5 bit.


Makes me wonder how soon we’ll see an announcement. Maybe not this direct but for the first direct of 2024, launch for holiday 2024 makes sense to me


Cant wait for the switch 2 for pokemon to absolutely still make shitty graphic games


I was just thinking about how backwards compatibility feels more likely. Edit: Mainly because of all of the recent ports and announcements. Company of Heroes being announced definitely made me think some developers are going all in now because hopefully digital libraries will carry over and there's no need to delay the release for the launch of the new system. Total early morning speculation though...


If the rumors are true, Monoliths next game will be freaking glorious. I can't wait!!


Makes sense to me, they’d want developers to get to developing games for it by now if they want the console to launch next year. Though, I wonder if they would really upgrade BoTW’s graphics just for a tech demo and not for a launch rerelease alongside TotK. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet was also leaked to have a graphics enhancement patch for the Switch 2 release which makes me think most, if not all, latest 1st party Switch games will get a huge graphics improvement to encourage Switch users to move on with their existing library.


If Nintendo are making a 'Switch 2' then keeping with Nvidia is by far the only logical option.

* AMD does not have an Tegra equivalent and other ARM SoC manufacturers don't have the same GPU support as Nvidia.
* Keeping to ARM would streamline development and make it easier for it to be backwards compatible with Switch 1 titles.
* DLSS is by far the superior choice for upscaling graphical quality while keeping the power usage down.

The original Switch is based on the Tegra X1 which was 2 years old when the Switch launched, by that reckoning the Switch 2 would have an Nvidia Orin with an Ampere GPU and LDDR5 RAM on an 8nm process which would bring power and heat generation down even more.

Smoking pure hopium here, but if the Switch 2 is specced as I suspect it will be, it would be nice for Switch 1 titles to receive Switch 2 updates rather than having to buy the games again. The Xenoblade trilogy and Zelda would look absolutely mega.


I just purchased Switch OLED, you're welcome guys

Update: I've finally had a chance to set it up and play some Breath of the Wild. It so amazing, why haven't I bought the switch earlier, it's a perfect device for me, so happy with it already 👌


What if Metroid 4 is the launch title and they announce it with a “yeah we know” comment


For all the posts on how a switch successor will be similar in style to the current console, people should really remember that nintendo is the company that makes left field look downright normal when it comes to designs. They have done such wild changes to each hardware generation (even the wii u had it's large tablet) that their next console could be literally anything and it wouldn't be shocking to me. 
(This is not a negative post btw, I am totally interested in what they come up with next)


Day one purchase if, beside the obvious backwards compatibility, the pro controller works on the Switch 2.


Hopes: Full backwards compatibility and transfer of digital games

Fears: No backwards compatibility and full transfer of Joycon drift


Some of you need to understand the difference between a random person posting alleged leaks on social media and a journalist doing his job by gaining sources and conducting interviews. That doesn't mean one shouldn't treat every piece of information with a fair bit of skepticism, but that doesn't mean one should disregard every information that is not official either.


I am absolutely ready to smoke that 4K/60 fps Xenoblade pack.


If it’s backwards compatible then they can’t sell us Mario  Kart 8 again.


I’m not ready to say goodbye to my switch


Hopefully they kept the colab with nVidia and packed DLSS 3 in.


Game Freak looking forward to dropping games at 720p on this thing


I remember back in 2020, My roommates and I had a serious conversation if we should hold off getting a switch for the house considering an switch pro was just about to be announced. And hindsight, dis funny


Im literally hoping above all switch library is backwards compatible if its not i will be very upset


I’m so conflicted on a Switch 2. I would need guarantees of backwards compatibility before I consider a purchase.

And even then, I think I’d be disappointed if developers didn’t go back and boost some of their ports. I guess there’s no point worrying about this now while the new console is nothing but a rumour, but I’m curious where everyone else stands.

Would you buy a Switch 2 if it was announced in the next few days? What are you waiting to see or hoping for?


I think Nintendo has more or less perfected their console design. Maybe future machines will have other gimmicks and features but I think the foundation is there now. From here on I hope it’s just upgrades to power and battery to handle better and bigger games


The demo including BotW sounds promising. I already have some savings set aside for Switch 2, but I am really cautiously waiting to hear official word about backwards compatibility.

I will find it very hard to justify buying Switch titles again or even putting away my Switch Library in favour of a clean slate.


What I'm really wondering is if we'll be able to use all the components of the Switch and just buy the Switch 2 screen/device without things like the Joycons, Dock, etc. 

That right there would be an insane home run and would drastically cut back some of the manufacturing costs because we'd be able to use the current stock that's out on the market. 

I would just find it wild if they took Backwards Compatibility to a whole new level.


as long as I get to transfer ALL my data, I got a 1tb mini SD with a bunch of discounts.

What would have been $500 USD at the time was reduced to $179 (including tax)

best purchase I've ever made and swore me off the physical copies forever.


Cool, now can they catch up to Sony and Microsoft and add in freakin VI accessibility.


If it is actually a Switch 2 then I’m down for it. The Switch has the perfect gimmick while also not being too casual like the Wii so just upgrading its power to not run essentially PS3/360 games is a good choice. They don’t gotta change what works, just add backwards compatibility to it too


I just want 3D again lol. Me and 3 other people.


It’s called Super Nintendo Switch


big if true


Fuck it. I’ll buy switch 2 and give my current switch to my niece.


I expect it to be a good bump up in specs but nothing thrillingly so, not because Nintendo isn't capable but because it doesn't really align with their strategy.  The more powerful the console, the more detailed the game, which means even longer development and having to figure out how to increase visual fidelity without abandoning the joyful simplicity of Mario and Zelda games.  

Their focus has always been on fun and innovation, with raw performance coming second.


Nintendo is really good at tailoring their own 1st party games to their systems. I suspect this is because they got their first real taste of third party support in years on this last system and see the potential.


As long as all my switch games work on the new one then I am happy, I have a switch and a lite. I would be happy to have a 3rd


Pyoro retweeted this report. It’s happening, the console is actually powerful.


Please don’t call it “Switch 2…”

It’s Super Switch or bust!


I just want 1080p 60FPS. Please, enough of this 4k crap


Switch 2 boosted by DLSS tech is going to punch above Series S.


Wouldn't be a surprise given that we're just over a year from what will probably be launch and the first devkits have supposedly been sent out. As usual we'll see a few Nintendo exclusives at launch and a few smaller titles that are easy to port i.e Sniiperclips


it desperately needs backwards compatibility. like that’s crucial, otherwise that would be so unbelievably shitty considering the vast library the switch has and the constant new releases.


Come on Nintendo release it, my Switch V1 is just tired and battery is showing its age. Not going to invest in an OLED at this point.


16 times the detail


My only wish is that be backwards compatible.


If what they're saying is true and it can actually from ToTK at 60 fps none stop then its a day 1 buy for me.

I have a day 1 switch and my god, I love it but CHRIST. It feels like im literally 15+ years old behind in technology when I hit 17 FPS in certain areas on Zelda...


As long as it's backwards compatible with the Switch 1 I'm all for it. Honestly with multiple kids I was already considering maybe getting a second switch console so I'll buy this with the intent of day 1, but in actuality will likely get it 3 months later due to Nintendo making about 1/4 of the amount of consoles to meet demand.


Make it back compat and im sold.


Just let me have backwards compatibility and allow me to play my games in a stable framerate (60fps preferably). I wouldn't mind if games run 720p/1080p handheld if it allowed for better framerates. I'd understand if some people would like 4k but leave that for docked mode.


Why do Warioware games keep marking a console's death? What does Wario know?


Switch 2 in handheld mode just as powerful as PS4 or more and in docked mode something between PS4 PRO and PS5. Along with better feeling joy cons and smoother e shop. That would be nice.


Reading that article, on that shitstain of a website, reduced the number of functional neurons in my brain.


Souped up BoTW doesn’t sound as impressive as the previous rumor of FF7R working on it but I’ll take it. Either way, looks like they’ve had enough of the hardware complaints from the devs and actually did something impressive to show it off to their partners. Hoping for DLSS technology personally.


How do we not have more information about the console if they demoed it to devs? I know loose lips sink ships, but none of the devs leaked a single thing?


Can't wait to play Baldurs Gate 3 on it in five years.


Hmm...

There were rumblings that Nintendo demoed Mario Wonder behind closed doors at Gamescom, and then a short bit later we got the Mario Wonder Direct.

Now we're hearing rumblings that they showed off the next system behind closed doors at Nintendo Live... and we're also possibly going to get a general Direct next Wednesday...

What are the chances they reveal the next system to the public next week? Since if they really did show it to developers, there's now a bunch of rumors going around about that happening and of what it's capable of. So what if Nintendo just decides to get it out there if there'll be rumors and people talking about it anyway?


we'll have the official press release within 6 months, mark my words.  I'd guess q1 or q2 2024 with a release date around a year from now.  gives the switch one last holiday push.


Truly godly. The day this marvelous device releases, is the day Christ himself will be resurrected.


Majority of people on here be like: I'll believe it when I see it 🤓

Or 

Just like the Switch Pro right 🤓

Just accept that Switch 2 is launching next year bros 😂


If it doesnt have BC they can fk off


‘Eurogamer understands’ = ‘Eurogamer doesn’t actually know’


[https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-showed-switch-2-demos-at-gamescom/](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-showed-switch-2-demos-at-gamescom/) The demos were apparently the matrix one for ps5 and XSX


Ah finally, we will play pokemon at 800p with a mostly stable 24 frames per second.


Metroid Prime 4 as a launch title, anyone?


If they don't call it the "Super Switch" and have the slogan be "Now you're Switching with Power, Super Power," I'm gonna be sad.


If its not called The Super Switch, someone fucked up.


But will it use the same toaster


On one hand, very excited for what’s to come. On another, a little sad the Switch era is ending.


oh shit


Ill get a switch 2 on launch if it has backwards compatability, if not ill wait a few years for it to have games i camt get on the switch.


Day 1 buy for me. Was toying with the idea to just get Rog Ally, but honestly I don't really want PC-like experience. Switch 2 it is.


I'm concerned about the future of the Nvidia Shield if the Switch 2 doesn't get a mobile chip low power enough to put in a Media Player.

Heck, maybe we'll get some RTX 4050 rejects in Switches and a Shield


God I really hope they don’t have a new name for it and literally just call it switch 2


All I care about is backwards compatibility with switch cartridges


I'm still waiting for them to remaster Twilight Princess for the switch, I guess that won't happen now


Good thing I just bought an oled switch....


I'll throw my wish in here as well: I want the dock to double as a wireless streaming receiver, so I can play on the TV wirelessly, then slap it on the dock and continue playing on the TV while it charges again.


Pretty sure this will be a day1 but for me.


Super Mario Kart 8 Delux?


If I have to repurchase splatoon 3 on my switch 2 I'll actually be so mad. I have it digitally, so there will be uproar if they don't account for thst


PRELOADED with silksong I presume


Hope the Switch 2 is backwards compatible.


Hoping when they said they showed Breath of the Wild that means it will be backwards compatible.  They mentioned in the article that does not mean Breath of the Wild will be re-released on the new console


Super Nintendo Switch!


> (To be clear, though - this is just a tech demo. There's no suggestion the game will be re-released.)

How about just release a patch instead. Don't give Nintendo any ideas about re-releasing a game with nothing but a literal patch.


So that pokemon DLC leak a few months that mentioned a new system was 100% accurate


F Zero GX4K

It runs in 4k60 just to flex, even though it has a 1080p screen.


All I need in my life is just a simple port of F-Zero GX, let them even just copy-paste everything.


Ready to Falcon Punch my mobile gaming.


[deleted]


The first console ever, that can handle F-Zero.


Switch 2 will be powerful enough to handle the "this is what mario will look like in 2013" meme


It's got boost power!


We gettin Mode-8 on the switch 2, for sure.


Day 1 purchase if it's backwards compatible with the switch.


The hybrid model just carves out a niche for Nintendo perfectly. Their home consoles were always weaker than PS/Xbox so I’d never consider buying 3rd party games on Nintendo before. With the Switch it’s more so “do I want to play this game portably or solely on my TV”.


Nintendo would have to be insane and hate money to not make their next console the Switch 2. It's arguably their most successful console ever.


Everyone keeps talking about wanting 4K from the next Switch.  If it's a handheld, there's no way it can run 4K.  The Steam Deck has way more juice and can't come close to 4K.  The dream is that they figure out some crazy technology that lets you dock to an external GPU without having to reset the machine.


I think the smartest thing they can do right now is just making a Switch 2 that can contend (graphics and performance) next to Xbox and PlayStation. They don’t need to out-perform them.


It's so unbeatable even the PC market is getting in on the action with the Steam Deck (and it's competitors). 

Not only will I get a Switch 2 (New Super Switch U OLED +) but my next gaming PC will probably be the next generation of Steam Deck because I love the hybrid model.


I personally never play in portable mode. For me it'll be a day 1 purchase if it's 100% retro-compatible.


Day 1 purchase….for all the scalper bots.

Good luck buying one of these for at least a year + after launches


If its hybrid and backward compatible (both games and joycons) and its size and weight is not larger then the original, then maybe.


Oh shit this is actually exciting then

Edit: it’s really funny looking back on all of those skeptical comments. Calling the rumor bullshit and questioning why they would undermine the 3ds’ sales, and their not ready to say goodbye to the 3ds


It breaks my brain a little that the editor-in-chief of a well-known online publication needs to be called out as having a 'credible track record'. It's good that you're calling it out, but the fact that you have to just points to the weird place we're in when it comes to leaks vs reporting.


Considering the Switch is over 6 years old it would be shocking if they didn't have a new console far along in development. Though I could see them holding off as long as the Switch continues to sell well.


They'll name it Swi+ch just so grandma can ruin Christmas


If it is a Switch like console, the only correct name is Super Nintendo Switch. No matter what they name it, that is the name if it works like the Switch.


Switch-U


I need it to be the Super Switch.


Wii and wii u had a similar problem. 

Nintendo doesn't do a good enough job with the names.


My money is that they throw in some gimmics to the joycons and put in some dual screen stuff like the WiiU and name it something like Nintendo Dual to highlight its versatility. 

They’d be fucking idiots to make the same mistake they did with Wii, 3DS, etc.


Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series


Watch their launch title be elden ring lol.


DLSS 3.5 would be pretty crazy, because it means that it's either an Ada Lovelace-based SoC, or a heavily modified Ampere SoC.

Or Nvidia is an ass and DLSS 3 could have been running on Ampere GPUs this whole time, which is unfortunately feasible.


“visuals comparable to Sony and Microsoft’s current-gen consoles."

This is rumored literally every time Nintendo makes a new console and every time it is not true.


This is definitely huge. Thank god for DLSS technology, now Nintendo will definitely not be that behind current gen. Something tells me they actually want current AAA games to actually work for the next console for it to hit big and give it enough distinction from Switch. I will not believe the DLSS 3.5 part because if they do that, we’d actually have to wait till the end of the next year to avoid any type of shortages.


Maybe the next pokemon game wont run like absolute shit even with gamefreak not giving a shit about optimizing.


"Comparable" is doing a shit ton of heavy lifting, there.

Comparable can literally mean anything. And after so many "Next Nintendo system is actually really megaton powerful!!!" since after the GCN, I think it be wise if expectations were accordingly set. This happens ALL the time in the lead up to new Nintendo hardware. When rumors of the Switch using Tegra X1 was known, people didn't think it would just be the off the shelf chip but a customised / more powerful version. And don't get me started on Project Cafe.

Switch 2 is gonna be quite capable but I think people are gonna disappoint themselves with what a 15W chipset can realistically pull off.


yeah I would perhaps be a bit skeptical with stuff like this lol


DLSS 3.5 is massive W
not even PS5 has it, they're dealing with the nonsense from AMD right now.


I'll take that with a grain of salt. But in any case it's good to hear Switch 2 will be a proper upgrade over the first one. I especially hope we'll get PS5-like loading times. That's where Switch \*really\* struggles.


> It feels like the Switch 2 could be a PS4 Pro style console, albeit with more more modern chipset.

I'm hoping that means GTA games in the future. The RDR port getting the Switch treatment gives me hope!


Considering the Switch still sells really well I think Nintendo would want a really short window between announcement and release. That way people don’t hold off on buying Switches for several months.


I had seen an article with the speculation that it could release in March/April of 2024, with the idea that Nintendo *should* release it then to not lag too far behind the PS5 sales. It noted it's speculation though.

Also to me, it would match the switch's release time frame as well, just 7 years later.


Not before this holiday season, I'd think. Doesn't make sense to hamper their biggest money making time of year.

Get one more Christmas out of The Switch, announce the new hardware in the spring for a late summer or early fall release. Big pre-release direct in June, big Post-release direct in September.


The power of super switch has allowed us to revolutionise the Pokémon universe.  You can now choose from 4 starter Pokémon.


GameFreak succeeded on making people think Switch was weaker than PS2 with their games, can’t wait for them to convince people Switch 2 is weaker than PS3.


With no voice acting because TPC is too poor.


If it is backwards compatible with everything on the Switch, I'd happily buy it even though my Switch is primarily used as a party game machine when my nephews are over for the weekend.


I feel like backwards compatibility would be a no brainer. I can’t believe we’re even having to wonder.


I struggle to think of even one legit reason to believe a Switch successor will not be digitally (and probably physically) backwards compatible with its predecessor. Historically, Nintendo is very much by far the most reliable when it comes to that aspect.

The next Switch would have to be such a massive change in architecture—As big as the change from the Wii/Wii U to the Switch, or the PS3 to the PS4—to justify *not* having it that I truly would be shocked to find out it wasn't compatible. And that just isn't happening with the gold mine that is the Switch; Nintendo is very invested in it. Not to mention how attractive it will be of a feature to advertise once the system is announced.

So I would not worry at all.


All i want is DS to 3DS cartridge compatability with the switch 2.

You could insert DS games into the 3ds and play them. The cartridges were different but the slot was designed to accept both designs. 

**BRING THAT WITH SWITCH 2**


Backwards compatibility has to be a given, along with data transfer so we can move digital titles over.

To be honest, all Nintendo needs to do is release a Switch with updated specs and maybe some new hardware feature to make it unique.


Wait company of heroes is coming to switch or are you talking about COH3 for Xbox/Ps?


It would be cool to have a better, more powerful, more optimized Switch that can still run Switch games 
However, would it mean the game for this new console would also be playable on Switch (like PS4 and PS4 pro), or should the new console completely replace the original Switch ?
Both options seem to have upsides and downsides


What are the rumors?? And bet. They use the full scope of the switch and excited to see what they do with the successor


Wait, what's the source about the Pokemon graphics enhancement patch? Not doubting. I'm just curious.


Developers probably already have dev-kits. They are just showing the finished console

Edit: well “finished”, we’re probably still a year out but I’d assume it’d be all the features they have planned and prototype hardware.


Serrious grapical improvement would go a long way on selling the next console. Especially if most games still are released along side the original switch.

Especially if it makes Scarlet/Violet more stable and beautiful. 

Porting popular games from other consoles that the switch can't handle will be important too. 

The PS5 has been out 3 years now and the only game I want that my PS4 and PC can't play is Spiderman 2.


I think if Switch 2's launch year included upgraded Pokemon S/V and TOTK along with a new Mario Kart and Metroid Prime 4... maybe even Elden Ring and FF7Remake announced for it... we'd see Nintendo's sales go through the fucking roof into the stratosphere.

Especially if they finally smashed their head hard enough on a wall and realized how much more money they'd make by creating a better EShop with more of their back catalogue on it *PLUS* modern day online infrastructure.

You think the Switch and 3DS sold well? Their sales would be smashed so fast.


Nintendo has a 10 year contract with Nvidia for hardware that included next gen hardware they entered into back in 2017.


The original switch was quickly put together due to WiiU failure out of chips that Nvidia couldn't sell. I'd expect closer collaboration this time, with more custom solution. Who knows, maybe they'll implement Lovelace, which is why they delayed the new console.


After gaming almost exclusively on the Switch for 3 years, I’m looking forward to going back to at least PS4 graphics.


They're definitely going with Nvidia.

/u/GrandDemand wrote a great summary [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/15f6heg/nintendos_switch_successor_is_already_in/jubxf9d/) about everything we know about the SoC. A lot of this information's sourced from the Nvidia data leak.


This is not the Nintendo way


Based on our experiences with emulating the Switch, most games will benefit massively just from running on hardware that isn't so weak. I don't have to do anything special to run most Switch games at 1080p or higher at a stable framerate. Some games might need to have their framerate unlocked.


If current Switch titles are forward compatible *and* somehow get performance patches, I'm actually okay if we don't see "Selects" titles on Switch, because if anyone can pop a copy of TotK into either the Switch or "Switch 2" and the latter applies performance updates based on the improved hardware, that's better than having to buy a new, Switch 2 specific version of the game.

Assuming that any of this happens of course.


I just came here to say that I am absolutely adding the phrase “smoking pure hopium” to my vernacular


Well, Gamestop will probably have some great deals where you trade in the OLED and 15 games for 3 cents off on a Switch 2


At the very least you might make use of it for one year


Same but I love it.

I’ll buy the Switch 2 pro/whatever edition when it comes out in like 4/5 years.


Trust me, there is enough on the switch to keep you busy for a loooong time while you wait for games to sprout on the new console. Remember when the switch first came out and all people had to play was Bugsnax? I remember. Play inscryption, it's $11.


Me too, just ordered mine yesterday to upgrade from my v1 switch and it'll come in tomorrow...😫


I also read a rumor that Mercury Steam has a dev kit and is currently working on Metroid 6 for the switch 2. Metroid Prime 4 and Metroid 6 launch titles would be insane. It’d be like when they released Metroid prime and Metroid fusion on the same day.


I don’t know how excited I’d be for Metroid Fusion as a launch title, honestly. Been there, done that a few times since I got it on my Gameboy Advance.


Ah fuck, I was just saying I'm not buying it if there's no save transfer/backwards compatibility.

But there's no way I'm missing M4 lol


 I doubt it. Metroid is not as popular in Japan as it is in the US and elsewhere. I would expect a new 3D Mario game or new Mario Kart as a launch title.


A lot of people are saying Nintendo is doing VR next


There next console is gonna be a standalone VR headset and people are gonna be upset.


Oh, definitely! I don't wanna retire my xenoblade pro controller yet!


If my Gulikit Pro can work on it I’m all in. Or if the new controllers are really ergonomic


More fears: All games will now be $70, including ones that launched at $60 and below cuz InFlaTion. Also more expensive NSO to rub broken glass and salt in the wound.


Very well said 👍👍👍


On the flip side, disregarding all information that isn’t official is a perfectly valid way of doing things. Just don’t kick a fuss about every rumor you see on reddit.


Theres a difference between re-releasing a game for a system 8 people bought, and a system that 120mil bought.

I realy don't think the MK8 re release/port was unreasonable.


That wouldn't stop them. Remember that Bowser's Inside Story was remade for the 3DS even though the original DS game was still fully playable on the system.


You act like they did it more than twice, honestly it's not egregious in any way.


Mario Kart 8 was an obvious rerelease title. 13 people bought the Wii U, the switch was not designed to run disc based games, and they’re both on completely different types of hardware. That is not the case with the switch and this new console.


They will release mk9


Don't worry, it's not going anywhere 🙂


Amazing console. Gasped when i recently realized when it originally released.

Time is a bitch


For reals. She’s been with my through so much.


nobody's forcing you to get rid of it.


Apparently they were showing demos with 3.5


I'm hoping your Nintendo account will be with you from now on. So all digital games can move forward to new consoles. It'd be insane of them not to do that in this day and age.


I have a launch day switch. It's still going strong but battery life is not what it was. I probably would upgrade at launch if it was backwards compatible and had better specs (OLED screen please?) Which I guess is quite likely. Depending on how big the improvement is I might also just wait for my current switch to die though haha.


Backward compatible and I'll buy it day one.  My Switch is beaten to hell by kids anyway.


Don’t really mind not boosted performance but physical backward compatibility is a must. It wouldn’t be a Nintendo if they wouldn’t have it.

They might give you turbo button but most likely everything would be 1:1 (as usual)

No backward compatibility == delay purchase until new Xenoblade/Xenosaga/Xenogears comes. Been like that for me with wii/wii u/3ds and switch.


I still use my OG Switch, bought on release to play BotW handheld, so for me it's a no-brainer. It's time for a new one now after 6-7 years of solid use and Switch 2 release is a perfect time to do it. 


It's going to be backwards compatible, not worried about that, it would be financial suicide to not offer that and ditch the current 100mill+ Switch users..


> Would you buy a Switch 2 if it was announced in the next few days? What are you waiting to see or hoping for?

I would, assuming the following:

* 4k docked output supported
* full BC with both digital and physical
* Similar format as the Switch, i.e. hybrid console
* As powerful as a base PS4 to PS4 pro
* under $400

That's all I'd need to be sold right away.  

Other things like Metroid Prime 4 as a launch title, better joycons, and 1080p handheld resolution support would be nice.


If I can transfer my games and saves, absolutely.

If not, then no.


The reality is the NES through the Gamecube were pretty moderate iterations, just improving controls and graphics over time. GB to GBA as well. Wii and DS shook things up, were smash hits, and were then iterated on (one in an odd way). I imagine a Switch 2 will be more 3DS like, maybe some new gimmick, but largely just an improved version of the last console, and "if" it succeeds it will be iterated on in the future.


Everything about the Switch has been stellar so far except the lack of Bluetooth support on launch, the kickstand (not that anyone really uses it) and the joycon drift. If they can invest in better joysticks, they'll alleviate so many problems. Lucky for us we could swap out joycons easily on OLED and OG. My Switch from 2017 is still going strong and I have high hype for what they can do with more beefy tech.


Wii U did it with Wii controllers.

Switch 2 might do it as well. Likely only usable for Switch 1 games though.

The rail can be made exactly the same. But I do hope the build quality of Joy-con 2.0 are better. I had to repair my launch right joy-con 3 times and made QOL fixes on the Pro controller. Never had to do that with any controller before.


Do what Sony does make nothing BC and force everyone to start over again = profit


yea but if the Switch 2 has the same joycons, and they're engineered better to not start drifting after a few months, i'll be buying the new joycons for sure


I love the form factor of the system and want the successor to be Switch 2, but I always hope for some new surprising features from Nintendo than simply beefier specs. They patented some clickable scroll wheel shoulder buttons they haven’t used yet that would be pretty neat, for example.


Stereoscopic 3D gaming lives on exclusively in VR now


small if false


Yeah me too, performance is more valuable than resolution to me. What's the point of a game looking extra crispy if it can't even run properly and stutter every couple of frames. Besides, for a handheld screen even 720p is ok, you reserve battery power and can focus on the performance instead.


With how successful the Switch has been (on top of games like Zelda selling 20 million+ copies) and their cash from the 3DS, I would hope Nintendo finally decided to at least play ball with a bit more power in their next console.

They certainly have the money for it.


If it was ever tracked back, they wouldn't be a dev any more.


You're commenting this on an article about devs leaking info...


Doubt they’d do that. It would hamper Switch sales over Christmas shopping season. They’ll want to squeeze every last drop out of the Switch while they still can.


Yeah probably right before second quarter 2024, so around March, similar to when they announced the first Switch.


These people can't comprehend that a rando on Twitter and an actual renowned gaming journalism website have the same level of credibility. This is the same website that leaked the Switch as a whole in 2016.


Eurogamer (the very same author) first leaked the Switch concept, hardware design and release date with a "Eurogamer understands" article.

EDIT: receipts for the curious, July 2016 https://www.eurogamer.net/nx-is-a-portable-console-with-detachable-controllers


I fucking hate comments like this. If you have absolutely no idea to journalism works, why even comment? Journalists wont expose their sources. Eurogamer literally blew the lid off of the NX concept and the internals before anyone else.


"Understands" means they've been told by multiple people that it happened


Super Switch U XL


Not sure if they want their console name shortened to [SS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel).


Sounds like potentially a performance patch, especially considering it didn't mention new texture work or anything.


I’m assuming they’ll do the same thing that Sony does with the PS5 versions of PS4 games.


 4k120


Me too! With the AX tracks/chars unlockable through slightly easier means this time.


My life would be complete.  YOU GOT BOOST POWER!


Some minor graphical touch ups is all it needs. The game is very good looking even by today's standards.


They quit making F-Zero because they ran out of new ideas for game play. The same reason for no TotK DLC. But they can milk Mario Kart for decades.....


Backwards compatible is a must for me.


I would absolutely be in shambles if they made it so they're not backwards compatible.

The Switch 2 is going to be basically the gameboy SP to the gameboy. There's no way or good reason the cartridge or the downloaded software not be backwards compatible.


Nintendo: *Best we can do is sell you Mario Odyssey Deluxe and Tears of the Kingdom Deluxe for $70*


Apart from Wii U -> Switch transition Nintendo has been pretty good about backwards compatibility since the beginning.


It better be considering how much they’ve been pushing digital sales, with then NSO vouchers and stuff.


Technically not always, the gamecube was a powerhouse that was way ahead of the PS2, but the PS2 still came out on top by a large large large margin. I personally like to think this is when they realized power & specs isn’t everything, which only further became confirmed in their minds after the Wii killed it the next generation despite being far inferior to the PS3 & X360.


Its the best choice for a casual gamer who has friends that also want to play 2-3 rounds of mario kart and call it a night.

I cant imagine my mother buying an xbox to play something like animal crossing.

We just don’t care about the best of the best.


Nononono

The Super Nintendo was more powerful than the competition. It even had basic 3d features.

The N64 was more powerful than Ps1 in many ways in terms of processing and memory. It was held back slightly by the limitations of the medium. Cartridges couldn‘t hold nearly as much data as cds.

The gamecube was FAR superior technically than the competition.


> Their home consoles were always weaker than PS/Xbox 

For a long time Nintendo's selling point was the stronger hardware. The NES, SNES, N64 and Gamecube were all more powerful than their competition.

It's only their last 3 consoles; the Switch, Wii and Wii u that deviated.


People are expecting them to leverage DLSS because of their partnership with NVIDIA. I don't think reasonable people expect native 4K.


It actually wouldn’t be that hard now, you can have the a steam deck like SOC in the handheld portion that docks to a base through USB4/Thunderbolt that contains a power supply and much higher end dedicated GPU. 

The problem with that type of setup is that it would be prohibitively expensive for a console.


You don't need 4k in handheld the screen is like 6 inches lmao.

Pixel density is probably higher than my 65 inch 4k TV but I'm not gonna do the math.


"Next to" is not going to happen in a handheld format. Look at the size of the PS5 and it still struggles with some current gen games.

If they can get the Switch 2 on par with or slightly better than the PS4/XBOne gen of consoles, it pretty much opens up Nintendo's next console to ports of almost every game out there. Very few "current gen" exclusives exist for the PS5 or Series X/S.

Nintendo is also multiple console generations late in creating a proper online ecosystem for their consoles.


That's never going to happen. Not even the Steam deck can contend next to Xbox and Playstation graphics, and Valve is taking a huge loss on hardware. You also can't do that without having trash battery life, like on the deck where it dies within 2 hours if you're playing anything demanding.


By "contend" it doesn't even need to match them.  It just needs to be close enough that devs can get their games on there without having to effectively 'demake' them to get them there, and it can do that with power comparable to an Xbox One as long as it's got modern processing features.


They make a killing on their undiscounted software. I hope they take a loss on consoles and push greater performance as a launch selling point, as the other big players do.  Make this thing powerful for years to come.

It’s funny about all the skepticism toward the logistics of the device. Though honestly, I’m retrospect (and after seeing the travesty that is the PlayStation Portal), the Switch’s design is a bit of a miracle. It’s a complex portable console that looks and feels like a toy. That’s impressive.


I definitely didn't get those *exact* same comments from people yesterday when I pointed out that there's a lot of reasons to believe new hardware is coming.

Those people apparently think no new hardware is ever coming no matter what.


Well to be fair, they weren’t ready to undermine the 3DS. It stuck around for several years


Yeah, like, the fact that there’re 99 SEO-riding fluff articles for every real piece of journalistic writing has really warped our perceptions of what a ‘reporter’ is, right?


Grandma, this is a Stadia.

Introducing the new Nintendo Swiitch!


SNS does feel very Nintendo. Right there with NES and SNES


Ey, switch u too pal!


Switch-er-U


Yep. Product Name, then Super Product Name, then Product Name Number is a tried and true pattern

Just go back to that please Nintendo


I mean, for the record, the competition just adds numbers after the name (I guess the "Xbox Series X" is kinda different). I understand why they do it, as they are electronics/computer companies that have Playstation/Xbox as one of their brands, while Nintendo is a video game company.


I'd buy it


Elden Ring worked great on my SteamDeck! I'm sure Switch 2 hardware whatever they finalize could run it as well!


Would definitely buy it specially its complete on cartridge no internet required to play


Instant buy.


PS4 Pro power will be astonishing, primarily cause Nintendo always makes their games look like their "next gen" anyway. A Mario or Zelda will look easily like a PS5 game, for example


Oh my gosh, I'd totally buy it


DLSS 3.5 could mean only the upscaling and ray reconstruction stuff, Frame Generation is technically separate and Nvidia does a terrible job naming stuff.


DLSS 3.5 is not Frame Generation, is available for every card that used DLSS 2.0 (yes naming is shit)


Interestingly, they've removed DLSS 3.5 from the story.


Not true at all. Way back in the NX days most leaks reported power barely above the Wii U, which ended up being true. Now leaks are split 50/50 between the next console being close to either the PS4 or the PS4 Pro in power.


I'm not expecting it to be like the PS5. As mentioned in my post, I'm expecting something similar to the PS4 Pro but much better.

The thing is - with DLSS used to make games achieve a 4K output, games can easily look like a PS5 game. Whether or not it's as detailed, can match framerates etc is a different question. Heck, RDR2 on my Xbox One X still looks absolutely extraordinary at times.


Unfortunately this is a race against time.

If Nintendo released the switch 2 NOW, your statement would still hold fairly true, but fsr is improving by leaps and bounds every day, just Google what fsr2 implementation did for the switch version of No Man's Sky.

Improved iq, its... its the best iq on switch, it's NOICE. Improved performance, improved lod distance Improved effects and particles.

FSR can be implemented on any hardware, and WILL continue to be improved and be implemented on those consoles, which means we will very soon have a situation where that same kind of  technique the switch 2 would be using to close the gap between the more powerful consoles, will also be used by those more powerful consoles to pull back ahead.


Nope, Gamefreak is a terrible developer when it comes to optimization and will find some way to fuck up.


Wasn’t Chrono Cross running worse on PS5 than it did on PS1? Never underestimate incompetence.


No, GameFreak could be given a PS5 to work with and will still be a buggy, unoptimized mess. It's not hardware issues they're facing, it's time crunch and cutting as many corners as possible.


their games were better when they were on worse hardware


Yeah, but it'll still *look* like absolute shit.


I believe NVidia will absolutely have the best DLSS technology they offer. I believe it will likely have some ray tracing, because NVIDIA. But the idea that it would have like "advanced" ray tracing and comparable visuals to current consoles... no way.

imo, it *is* going to be more powerful than some people expect. I think it will run games better than the current-gen Steamdeck, mostly because optimization of games for a set system and DLSS being better than FSR. Otherwise I think it will be in the ballpark, powerwise with the Steamdeck.

But raytracing that can be relied on and not tank framerates? I think that's a pipe dream on Switch 2. And maybe on a 7 (or 8") screen, it might *look* like Series X or PS5, but there's no way its *technically* comparable. Having said that, we are getting to a point of diminishing returns.


I mean obviously you've got to be

But it's not far fetched honestly, Nintendo and Nvidia have most definitely been working closely to develop a new chip for their next system that will be able to take advantage of Nvidias technology more than ever

I mean it would be silly otherwise seeing as the switch has done so insanely well


[deleted]


I agree. I could see them doing an announcement during summer 24 games stuff (since I assume E3 won't be relevant). Have the release date be fall of 24. That'd allow them a huge dump of info over the summer keeping the hype up for launch.


That does make sense. I guess I’m just curious if we could expect an announcement this direct and a release this Christmas or if they’ll hold off until 2024. 

Seems wild to think we’re getting definitive rumors of play testing during gamescom but still a year out from release


This makes sense to me as well, get the initial launch sales done and have new shipments and stocked stores for the holidays


(The 4th one is Pikachu)


I would be kind of surprised if they didn’t do it. I mean yes, they’ve repeatedly not done it. But it seems like there’s not a good reason to do it, since the successor will probably use ARM and the code base now is basically modern. Really curious about what’s powering this. Nvidia has an Orin (?) next gen chip they’ve been showing off. But AMD has also talked about an ARM+RDNA APU and they have been able to bag both Sony and MSFT. 

Now Nintendo I suppose could also go way out in left field and use a Zen APU like the Deck, but that would probably blow their unit prices out of the water.


I would get the new console on or as close to day 1 as well if backward compatibility is fully implemented. Spouse is taking up a lot of TV gaming time so it’d be nice to have my own for playing next to her.


I'm even stronger in my opinion: if it's _not_ backwards compatible I will not buy it any time soon, because my Switch backlog is simply too large. If I can finish these games on the new console I'll upgrade, and if not...well, maybe by the time it gets a discount or a revision or something.


Despite all the things Nintendo does wrong (and there's quite a bunch of things), backwards compatibility is something Nintendo historically has been pretty good with. It usually was always at least one generation backwards.

On the handheld side, the GBC was compatible with the GB, the GBA was compatible with GBC, the DS was compatible with GBA, and the 3DS was compatible with the DS.Similarly, on the console side, the Wii was compatible with the GC, and the WiiU was compatible with the Wii.

The only outlier since the GC really is the Switch, and given the radically different form factor, that was really not unexpected (Nintendo did really milk it for all it's worth though, given the high amount of WiiU releases). If the Switch 2 will be similar to the switch in form factor (which it likely will), I'm fully expecting backwards compatibility.


Yeah, Nintendo has been very good with backwards compatibility when the consoles are iterations on previous models which a “switch 2” is clearly sounding like it will be.


I can think of a couple: it's more profitable for both Nintendo and third parties to sell people games again with minimal effort. In fact third parties might feel they lose the opportunity to re-sell or remaster games which are already available on Switch. See RDR on Xbox as an example.

The architecture might not be drastically different, but it could be different enough to add significant cost to make the consoles and that would drastically effect retail price and sales.

I do agree that not having backwards compatibility would severely hamper a new console at this point, Switch 2 would start from 0, instead of inheriting a 5k game library on day 1, that would see a temporary sales boost on most highly rated games on the eShop. So it's pretty likely to have it, but I would say it's far from certain. Nintendo have a habit of making strange hardware decisions.


The only difference with the cartridges was a small tab on the side, to prevent putting a 3ds cart into the ds


All I want is a chance to finish Radiant Historia.


How are they going to sell you Tropical Freeze again, this time for $70, if they allow backward compatibility?


It may be asking too much, but I also hope they allow the Switch and Switch 2 to share a digital library just like you can do with two Switches currently (having a primary and secondary, which can both access digital games).

I'd love to be able to play my current library on a new console, but also have the option to still play them on the Switch when my kids inevitably take over the Switch 2 (or vice versa; hand them the Switch when I'm using the Switch 2).


Yes. The first game and the expansions:  


[https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/16ap122/the\_company\_of\_heroes\_collection\_storms\_nintendo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/16ap122/the_company_of_heroes_collection_storms_nintendo/)


I would think new games released for the Switch 2 would not play on the Switch. Likely, they will change the shape of the cartridges slightly so that Switch carts will fit into the Switch 2 but not the reverse (assuming they're going for full backward compatibility).


I wouldn't be surprised to see a transition period where the Switch still gets games made for the next console as long as they're viable, but the versions made for the next console will look and run substantially better.  Over time fewer games get made for the old Switch while the new one is still getting all the new games.


Apparently the visuals of this new console might be comparable to the PS5 and X Box series consoles.


Some leaker leaked details about Pokemon DLC beforehand and it included them saying they were working on a graphics enhancement patch alongside for DLC2. Obviously take it with a grain of salt but everything else in the leak so far actually happened. [source](https://x.com/soulsilverart/status/1698124110868439383?s=46&t=I_h8cio7yE9OQf73REY0TQ)

Iirc, there was a spanish studio that reported on having gotten a dev kit, so it's definitely something already out in the wild for (bigger or close partnered) 3rd party devs


For sure they would already have the kits. They can get out years ahead of launch sometimes.


> The PS5 has been out 3 years now and the only game I want that my PS4 and PC can't play is Spiderman 2.

I've got a PS5, and if you've got a P4, I'd say you're not missing out.

Basically everything I play is stuff I missed on the PS4 and things that come on the sub so I don't have to buy them on another platform.

Don't get me wrong, I like the Dual Shock design, but the 5, for me, has nothing driving it's purchase in hindsight. 

I'll probably be getting the MGS Collection Vol1, and MAYBE GT7 at some point on sale, otherwise it's mostly just stuff from the sub service I play, most of which is available elsewhere, or not a system seller.


I think that's what a lot of people want. Just the Switch with more power

It'd be hard to iterate on this niche, but who knows what they maybe came up with (hopefully nothing too drastic)


Even the programming that's so common in the first party games and which was then used in 3rd party ports for dynamic resolution and frame rate to let the games not slowdown could just be brilliant with a bunch more power. Games that were muddy and jerky will become fluid and clear


They bet on the right horse then, given DLSS and raytracing ability has separated Nvidia from AMD.


I'm pretty sold on the Nvidia hacker dump being accurate.  Some hackers pissed at Nvidia for Ampere's Hash Rate Limiting firmware feature (which made them a lot worse at mining ETH) got a hold of a bunch of proprietary data including specs and firmware on Tegra T239 and an "NVN2" API for it.  (NVN was the name of the API made for the TX1 for Switch).

It's some pretty sweet specs for a handheld system, with no 'fluff' like CAN, SPI or other interfaces meant for embedded systems.  There's not really any reason to customize it any further.

Oh, and the delay had to do with Nvidia changing manufacturers.


What isn't the Nintendo way?

Because if you're talking about backwards compatibility, Nintendo has had more consoles with backwards compatibility, than those without.

In fact, the only times they haven't had backwards compatibility is when they switch game media, between discs and cartridges.

Even the SNES/SFC was planned to have backwards compatibility before they were forced to drop the feature to save costs to keep the price of the console competitive. The original SFC shown to journalists did have the feature, and it was meant to be a selling point of the console.


Or you can be smart and sell it for a couple hundred on FB marketplace


Oh I know, I'm going to enjoy the hell out of it 😀. And next year I can sell this Switch OLED and upgrade to Switch 2.


> It’d be like when they released Metroid prime and Metroid fusion on the same day.

don't tease me like this


I think Nintendo would delay Metroid 6 by a year if they're on the same console.


If they announced Prime 4 and Dread 2 for launch month I'd be a day 1 buy instantly. Give me that fucking shit ASAP.


Metroid Fusion remake? In the style of Dread? I'd buy the new Switch day 1!


Underrated sarcasm, right there XD


Lmao


best part of switch for me as compared to ps/xbox is the local party, with the abundance and ease of joycons. if its really vr next i cant see me getting 4 helmets 😭 😭


Man can you imagine the xenoblade games at even 1440


Making me question if this is on reddit with its sober nuance.


True, but it's been the only Mario Kart game that's been released for the past *9 years*

(Mario Kart: Home Circuit & Mobile doesn't count)

With the added DLC, it just feels like they're milking tf out of it.


There were dozens of us that bought the Wii U! Dozens!


Well, that didn't end well


The 3DS had better graphics and gameplay changes, and was released almost a decade later.


Mario Kart 8 is such a historic game with how long it's lasted. It's what motivated my family to get a WiiU back in the day, and has been a regularly played staple ever since. The original WiiU DLC tracks still feel "new" to me, but they've been part of the base for like 6 years now


And you can't really blame them. The game has sold 63 million copies and only 8.5 million of those were on Wii u. The decision to resell was 100 percent the right call.


it's not an egregious amount of releases of it, it's more just kinda crazy that it'll be minimum 10 years between Mario Kart entries. It used to be much more often:

-  1992

- 1996

- 2001

- 2003

- 2005

- 2008

- 2011

- 2014

We essentially averaged one every 3 years for nearly a quarter century, and then just stopped haha


No, the moment the Switch 2 is released, every Switch 1 will be deactivated and will permanently show a prompt to buy the S2. It sucks, but that's just how it is.


Of course its going everywhere, *undocked*


This so much, it's very weird. I was in my early 20s just out of school when the Switch came out. Went to the midnight release, man such good times. 

Now I'm in my late 20s with a career... What happened??


I bought a Switch so I'd have something to do in the delivery room while we were waiting for my wife to give birth. (My wife is awesome and was cool with the idea. She's a hero.)

My now 6 year old son just broke the dock output on the Switch that was in the room where he was born.

I can't wait for a new version (so I can play it with him on the TV again.)


I loved my switch before, but it totally carried me through the pandemic.


Eurogamer dropped the 3.5 claim from the article, but yeah thanks to crappy naming, 3.5 works on anything 2.0 did, but does not include 3.0's frame generation.


I think it will/ should. Transferring from 3DS/Wii U to Switch was pretty easy, IMO.


I replaced the battery with a kit from ifixit. It took me about 30 minutes. Worth the money.


You can replace the battery


It probably won't have an OLED screen


I'd pass mine to my will-be 5 year old to introduce her to simple stuff. Would be a really exciting time for me


I pray to God they stop skimping on bargain-bin WiFi radios.

WiFi 6 should hopefully be onboard too.

They SHOCKED me with USB-C on the original Switch as that was wildly new-ish tech at the time, and Nintendo is historically very slow with adoption.

No one's giving you 1080p in handheld, it's a waste of battery


To be fair, if it didn't suck so much, I'd probably be more willing to use the Kickstand.


medium if unknown


Its not a matter of money to make a powerful handheld. Any medium sized company can make a powerful device.

If you look up the history of the handheld market, the hard part has always been managing the four pillars: portability, power, cost and battery life.


My gut tells me it's gonna be the release timeline of the Switch delayed by 6-ish months. Announcement in April, release in late September or October.


Wow literally the same author too. This gives a *lot* of credibility. Thanks for the homework.


Indeed. There is a difference between even well established leaker, and a journalist talking to multiple people at the presentation. Heck, we know now that a lot of the first "public" reveals of the NX were to devs behind the scenes at E3 2016, so a lot of those Eurogamer sources from that article were likely people in those presentations. This appears to be just a repeat of that kind of situation, where we've got Nintendo finally unveiling near final hardware outside the company at a convention, and that's resulting in the first real details coming out.


>> EDIT: receipts for the curious, July 2016 https://www.eurogamer.net/nx-is-a-portable-console-with-detachable-controllers

> And then there's Pikmin 4, which Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed to Eurogamer just over a year ago.

I'll say...


"You see how they always say 'people familiar with the matter', but who are these people?!"

Like it's literally not a conspiracy, it's just journalism. Drives me batty.


Yeah, people not understanding how reporting works, how sources work, and what exactly it means to put your credibility on the line to report such things.

People are over saturated with standalone people or “leakers” and not so much journalists/news sites that actually have access to these things.

“Who is their source?” People always ask. C’mon guys. I’ll go so far as to use an extreme that should make it clear: Watergate. Their source was revealed because THAT’S HOW SOURCES WORK.

Some rando independent guy online? Sure, be skeptical. But, a legit website? Yeah, it’s probably true. If you still want to be skeptical, go for it. Not like this changes much of anything.


>Me too! With the AX tracks/chars unlockable through slightly easier means this time.

Optional, F-Zero GX was the racing version of Dark Souls


Yea i'd be holding off on buying it for years if its not. Well, i say that, but if they drop a new 3d mario thats another 10/10 and only on switch 2 it'd be pretty hard for me to resist.


>Backwards compatible is a must for me.

I keep saying this but I know I will buy.

It is not like I do not have my Switch consoles right now.  And I could still play this stuff here.  Having BC is great.  Sort of like how Xbox had BC, but then I never really use it.  Just so much new stuff anyway.  And with Switch I really might just keep using the old system for those game with the OLED screen. 

Then again I could see the power boost actually helping some of these games with no work.  The frame rate drops and other things are likely because the hardware just cannot handle what is going on well.  So better hardware very well could make these things smooth.

I also figure they will have some launch game I really want that is only on the new model.  Knowing there will be more going forward.

The last piece of the puzzle though is I buy everything.  I just preorder and get it.  Every piece of hardware.  Usually end up with at least 2 in the house on most things.


Nintendo does have a pretty good track record for backwards compatibility though


I was just thinking about this. Just like the 3ds could play all the ds carts. Perhaps switch 2 carts will have a notch on the top. Very Nintendo move.


> There's no way or good reason the cartridge or the downloaded software not be backwards compatible

If it is a totally different processor architecture/SoC platform, that would be a really good reason

Yo totk was already $70. Deluxe Edition gonna be $100 and come with a bunch of crap


PS2 was first to market and made the genius move of DVD playability.

Lots of families at the time bought a PS2 as their first DVD player because it was in the same price range (sometimes cheaper!) than standalone DVD players


Yeah, there is that weird "Nintendo is always behind" belief, when really that was true after the Wii. The handheld line technically, but there wasn't really a credible contender there tell the PSP, which still released after the DS so even that's not a clear cut case of Nintendo being behind the competition (partially since they wouldn't have known Sony was entering the market when DS design started). 

Basically after losing two gens when going too hard on power first while ignoring things like Media format, the Wii was a big shift in strategy.


The GameCube had a huge problem though- disk space. Each disc was at most 1.5GB versus the PS2’s 4.7GB. You can turn settings down, refactoring a game to fit within 1.5GB instead of 4.7 is a lot harder.


Resident evil 4 on gamecube still holds up today 

That console was packing a lot of heat in that little box


PS2 was just a monster of a console - literally *thousands* of games were made for that thing.


The mini discs really held back the Gamecube. If they just used normal sized discs and could fit ports and play DVDs, they would really have had something


The N64 was more powerful than the PS1 too. The Wii is when things changed.


Nintendo have been spooked by the explosion in PC handheld options — what were niche models (mostly just sold via pre-orders via Indiegogo with CPUs like an Intel Atom) have now become a maturing market with serious specs and design.

Switch games running at (or near) launch day emulated on a Steam Deck might have made some executives at Nintendo to wonder if they should pivot to a different form factor / UI to maybe avoid some of the "yeah it just works to play Nintendo Switch games on my Steam Deck" vibes.


It’s also the best choice for parents of young kids. I have a one year old so our TV is frequently taken, I have to leave the living room frequently, lay down early to put the kid to bed. 

I have a PS5 and gaming desktop and neither get much use. I use my Switch for Nintendo games, and I have an ROG Ally for all my bigger “console” games now. The portability of handhelds just works better for me now.


They're basically the only company still actively/deliberately servicing the local multiplayer market.


>SNES was more powerful

Actually it was *less* powerful in terms of CPU and standard pixel rendering -- but it put its power in all the right places by offloading other stuff to subsystems.  Yeah Genesis games looked sharper because it had a higher resolution frame buffer (SNES also had a 'high res' render mode but the large frame buffer for it could only do 30fps; it was only used in specific instances by specific games), but SNES had superior sound, and it featured a Mode 7 processor that could transform a single sprite with arbitrary 3D transformations, i.e. how MarioKart and F-Zero work.  The 3D features you're talking about are actually not on the SNES, but a coprocessor included on the cartridge of certain games, such as the SuperFX 2 coprocessor included on the Star Fox and Yoshi's Island cartridges, but if we're including that in console power then you have to compare those to the Sega 32X add-on, which was technically superior but not feasible in that game development/publishing market.

N64 was just *weird.*  Yeah there were some things that were directly more powerful, such as the number of polygons it could process per second.  There were some things it did correctly that the PS1 did *incorrectly* such as texture mapping (PS1 textures are 'clipped' and thus exhibit some weird looking 'swimming.')  But it had really stupid memory bottlenecks and other stuff that significantly held back its performance, and it wasn't just the cartridge vs CD thing that held back its ability to produce nice looking visuals.

I don't think it's accurate to say the GameCube was "far superior."  This was still an era where the hardware was relatively specialized and inflexible -- you had separate geometry processing units, texture mapping units, vertex shading units and pixel rendering units and so optimizing a game for a console was a matter of maximizing what pieces get processed when.  Yes the GameCube at optimum throughput was about 30% better than the PS2 at optimum throughput, but the balance was different -- the PS2 was balanced more toward high geometry (leading to naive and gross looking motion blur implementations) while the GameCube was better with texturing and shading, which is a shame because it was again held back by game storage medium.  But on a tech level both were very inferior to the Xbox which was 100% more powerful than the GameCube.


That is the thing with the PS1/N64 era is that there were genuinely some games that the PS1 couldn't do because of its architecture. It couldn't have done Mario 64 or Ocarina of Time as it just wasn't fast enough. There's a reason why the biggest sellers on the PS1 tended to be RPGs and survival horror games, not action titles


You don't need 4k on a 6 inch screen


Very true, a switch 2 with excellent screen and more power just means it opens Nintendo up for a subscription service like psplus.... 

This could help them make more money but it will dilute the Nintendo games library if we see ports of ps4/ps5/xboxes

So its interesting to see what they do there


Don't forget the switch is 1080p.

If the power in the switch 2 matches a PS4, it could easily run most games at 720p 60fps and not 4k.

Nvidia supplying chips with DLSS would be gravy.

Docked 4k probably not gonna happen with handheld being a priority.


A big problem with modern games is they aren't designed very well, very bloated compared to past games.

That could be solved without higher specs, just compress the game better (probably wrong word)


Uh… Elden Ring and Cyberpunk are quite good on the steam deck


They don’t need to, a Switch with a more efficient chip probably wouldn’t even need a fan (passive cooling), they only have to add power to the dock with DLSS or some other type of upscaling to hit 4K and make it look more modern.

No-one cares about monster graphics with Nintendo, frankly we’d all be happy with PS4 power and games running at 60fps @ 1080p with smooth edges and no pop in. Legends Arceus was a much-needed refreshment to the Pokémon series but Christ it’s performance was ugly, the only thing saving it was it’s art style.


Baking in losses on hardware is a bad move.  It's what ultimately sunk Sega as a first party.  If your software doesn't take off to the degree you need it to, suddenly you're left with a console that you can't afford to sell to people.


It might seem like a miracle but it was no chance or luck, it was years of engineering and design work to get it right. They even essentially had to (expensively) fail first with the WiiU to really find something that works


The gamepad was one of the most comfy things to hold ever


Well, it’s definitely not comfortable to hold if you don’t have kid sized hands, that’s for sure.


I think the problem is evry year there are rumors about a new console and naturally, people stop believing those.


r/nintendo is fully convinced there will never be another new Nintendo console.


I remember when Stadia was announced a good friend and I got in a disagreement about it.  He said “bro this is the future!” And I said “Yrah you’re right but it was created in the best part of the country for data infrastructure.  We live in Kansas we won’t be streaming games with no latency at 4K.”

We stopped talking for like two weeks he got so mad haha


At least you got a nice chromecast and bluetooth controller :P


"It's not a phone grandpa, it's a Helios"


Switch 2 is more understandable than a new switch or switch +

Switch 2 doesn't have multiple meanings that parents and shop clerks need to navigate when buying and selling hardware. 

I've been trapped in a conversation with a gamestop employee who didn't know what a new 3Ds was, and it's awful. 

It might seem lazy to you to just add numbers, but to me, it's just simple and easy for everyone to understand


sadly same... i only gotten past godfry before work and life got in the way... again the switch 2  would be perfect in my grubby commuter hands!


Elden Ring actually worked better on Steam Deck than most PCs because you could sidestep the shader compilation stuttering by precaching them


Elden Ring will be a launch title for the Super Nintendo Switch in the same way Skyrim was a launch title for the original Switch.

Also expect Red Dead Redemption 2 at launch.


Playing without player notes/messages would take away a bit of the experience IMO.


Lol what a hyperbolic take


[removed]


Let's not get hyperbolic now. I'm sure it will look fantastic but I'll reserve judgement until I see something tangible.


Xbox One X is more powerful so it would be better to have those specs


DLSS is the worst named product NVIDIA has. It's really like 6 different technologies and only one of them is actually Deep Learning Super Sampling.


It all started with Nvidia calling their fancy upscaler "super resolution."

lol


It's probably too specific. If it ends up being something else, it would be a bad look.


You’re right, PS4 or better is more or less confirmed. People acting like “only” having PS4 power in a handheld being a disappointment amuses me. That’s just crazy to imagine but the numbers check out, this should be possible!

I expect Nintendo to scale things down a little but even if we’re slightly below a PS4, that’s seriously impressive. Even with that processing power, just upgrades in software tech should make it able to render some beautiful scenes that feel fairly current-gen. On a handheld.


I can see the GPU being more powerful than what’s on the PS4. The PS4 is then years old it shouldn’t be that hard to pull off. I wonder if the ARM CPU on the new Switch is more powerful than those terrible Bulldozer cores though. Nintendo has a habit of under clocking their CPU’s.


Yeah, I'm not sure how that comment got so many upvotes when it's a load of crap.


I think it's pretty safe to say Switch 2 = PS4 Pro/One X with really impressing upscaling.


having to release every 18months forever doesn't really leave much time for optimization. It's totally inevitable when the primary goal of the videogames is to drive merchandise sales. 

They can't even do the "well just have three different teams working on games with 4 year lead times like Call of Duty" because the entire issue is they need a constant stream of new pokemon designs that are "Canon" to feed the monster and a 4 year lead with inevitable reworks doesn't fill the merchandizing pipeline fast enough.

to be clear, none of this is excusing the results, just further explaining why no amount of "Better hardware" will ever make pokemon games good.\*

---
\* in fact the best games were on the worst hardware, which kind of says something...


I think the Steam Deck is a good benchmark for Nintendo to hit. Since the steam deck is designed to support practically everything, there’s a lot of things that could improved upon performance and hardware-wise if it was optimized for its own games in the way Nintendo consoles are. 

For example if a switch 2 had a quieter fan and was less bulky than the steam deck, then that’s already a huge W for Nintendo. Really looking forward to seeing what we end up getting.


Yeah, I think the big win for Nintendo in the "current/next" gen is going to be that the PS5 is trying to target native 4k. If the next Switch is still aiming for native 1080p, and then using DLSS to hit those higher resolutions, the power gap, while huge, won't feel as noticeable as the gap between Switch and PS4.


GTA runs on the 360, it could easily run on the Switch. It just seems that Rockstar thinks there's not enough market for it on the console, which is ridiculous


I can see this as well. Plus nintendo in recent years have been keeping announcements and reveals close to release dates with very few exceptions (BOTW, Metroid Prime 4)


They've only really not done it when they can't hardware wise. DS to 3DS and Wii to Wii U all did back compatibility. So did GB to GBA and even DS had a GBA slot. Wii had Gamecube ports. The pattern is back compatibility more often than not


Nvidia switching fabs for their mobile chips caused yet-unexplained delays in Nintendo's announcements, so it seems like a safe bet it'll be Nvidia again.

Which also points to backwards compatibility. Let's face it; Nvidia isn't cheap to buy from. If Nintendo is picking them again, it's probably for a reason.


An ARM-based SoC makes more sense for a handheld device that isn't tied to games developed for PC. The Zen APUs are nice but still can't compete when it comes to performance per watt


Nintendo have not repeatedly not had backwards compatibility. Wii + Wii U, Wii + Gamecube, 3DS + DS, DS + GBA is much better than their competitors.


Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the primary reason BC wasn't included for the switch is the processor architecture changed. The Wii U used a PowerPC CPU, like the Wii, but the Switch uses Tegra which is ARM. Assuming the Switch 2 uses a more powerful Tegra chip, then backward compatibility should be significantly easier to achieve.


Yeah that’s a good point. I’m probably feeling oversensitized to the subject right now because many journalism outlets have made it a point to sensationalize the fact that we don’t yet have that confirmation about backwards compatibility. To be sure, we don’t even really have confirmation that the console even exists yet.


This is the wrong take. In terms of consoles, the Wii and Wii U are the outliers. The SNES, N64, GameCube, and Switch are all not backwards compatible. 4/6 home consoles made by Nintendo do not have this feature. Backwards compatibility was always a handheld thing with Nintendo. 

So we are in a confusing grey area where the Switch is both, so we have no way of using either precedent effectively to determine their likely course of action. Which is a complicated way of saying based on Nintendo's history, backwards compatibility is still a complete crapshoot.


If anything, backwards compatibility means Nintendo can continue selling copies of their 1st party games at full price (that never go on sale) for a whole other generation.


You're very right to point out that it's not a done deal. Backwards compatibility *sometimes* happens, but not *always*, so it can't be a given either way.


I know your joking but I seriously hope they can leave behind this whole Wii U/Switch era of games behind and move forward either developing fresh new games or doing beefed up Remasters/Remakes instead.


Omg that’s epic! The 1st game is honestly my favorite in the series


The next xenoblade game from them or their new series will look awesome. They are amazing


I wouldn't even bother taking it with a grain of salt it's accurate enough that even if there isn't a graphics patch I'd be more likely to believe gamefreak just scrapped it


I really wonder what they meant with DLC2. If it’s Indigo Mask, then the next Switch model was actually planned to drop in Winter 2023 (Dec 2023-Mar 2024) by the time this leak happened.


that grain of salt is big enough to crush a person


I got GT7 on sale on Amazon for like $44. But yeah before that I had a PS5 from launch and it sat on my desk collecting dust for like 2 years not even an plugged in.

I should have sold it when they were going for like $1k.


>In fact, the only times they haven't had backwards compatibility is when they switch game media, between discs and cartridges.

That's not true. The handheld systems have generally had good backwards compatibility, but the situation is different for home systems. The only examples I can think of for home systems is GC compatibility on the Wii, and Wii compatibility on the Wii U.


I mean…it’s Mario and friends turning left.

What more could a Mario Kart 9 really bring?


they debuted it TEN YEARS AGO!!


Wii u mk8 had dlc?


The perception of time speeding up as you age is such a weird phenomenon. I've been noticing it quite a bit in my late 20s. I assume it has to do with when you are younger, each day being a larger total % of your life. Or something to that effect.

I don't know how to describe it, but high school and college felt like such a long period of time, it felt like it was going to last forever. 

Graduated, started working, blinked a few times and now I'm in my late 20s like where the fuck did the time go bro

Really sucks in regards to gaming. My physical game collection is insanely big at this point but now I only have like 5-10 hours/week to sink into gaming. Gaming has almost become more of a collecting hobby to me than actually playing the games. I'm just now playing Switch and PS4 games I bought 3 years ago lol

The perpetual conundrum of having infinitely more money to spend on gaming than I did as a kid vs broke as fuck with infinite time to play as a kid.


Ironic that the *portable* console won hands-down during a time when nobody could go anywhere.


The switch was integral to a lot of people’s mental health during that time. When we all felt connected playing Animal Crossing. For lack a better way to say this - that launch could not have come at a better time.


True! I mainly play at home though so I can always plug it in if the battery gets low :) but I'll keep it in mind if it gets too annoying!


Not 4k rendering, just 4k output -- meaning HDMI 2.0 or newer.

I could see 1080p rendering with AI upscaling to work like 4k on first party, 8th gen and lower-end recent games, but end up rendering more like 720p and scaling up to 1440p or even 1080p and then *sharpening* to 4k.


At 720p on a 5.5" screen is not quite enough.  900p would be a decent compromise.


you might be right.  I'd be fine with a rock solid 720p/60fps handheld anyways.  Far cry from the OG gameboy I started out my protable gaming experience with ;)


^ the kick stand on the OLED is pretty good, and I use it fairly frequently while traveling


Important in direct proportion to veracity.


Especially the 4th for me. Like, it can be an ultra powerful handheld, but if the battery dies in an hour, then it makes it pointless to me as a handheld. My only hope if they're doing a switch 2 that will still double as a handheld is they keep improving the battery along side everything else.


early models are usually the most hack friendly


Given how long it's been since Odyssey I think a new mainline Mario on launch is very likely.


Same with the PS3 and Blu-ray’s. Crazy to think the $600 console was a cheaper option.


The PS2 also had backwards compatibility, the GameCube switched medium to discs which f-cked its gaming library in comparison.

The Switch would also have been f-chef if Nintendo hadn’t released Mario Kart 8, Botw and Odyssey all within the first year. They then drop fed deluxe ports of WiiU games in between big releases, they handled the lack of library perfectly.


Ah… back when you could drop $400 on a questionable-quality dvd player, or $299 on a dvd player that can also play some of the most critically acclaimed games of the time, and would go on to have one of the most extensive and quality backlog of games… Sony struck gold with the PS2 for sure


Exactly, power isn't everything. Waggle boys was fhe Wii's dvd player and portability is the switch's. Nintendo learned a lesson from losing to the ps2 that PlayStation didn't learn from winning.


The PS2 was the cheapest DVD player by a wide margin at launch, obviously by design since Sony owned the DVD format and controlled the pricing.

They could have done the same with the PS3 and Blu-Ray (which they also owned) but they got cocky and assumed people would buy it regardless of price. They didn't...


I’m guessing you’re 25-30 since your idea of Nintendo Handhelds is the DS vs PSP. You make a good argument as to why the DS should not be compared to the PSP. 

However, the Gameboy had 2 reasonable competitors from respected companies: Sega Game Gear and Atari Lynx. Gameboy hardware was inferior to both of those by a wide margin in every aspect except battery life.


and it was easy to carry!


Weird that the GameCube has more horsepower than modern consoles with the blowing a door up with a shotgun bit.


It's *still* the best selling console of all time, though only narrowly.


I have a high end gaming PC. 

&#x200B;

My PC also almost never gets used. I just don't like being stuck back in my room to game and being completely isolated like that


The graphic capabilities of the SNES were a direct upgrade of the NES. The NES had the PPU (Picture Processing Unit), and the SNES had the S-PPU (Super PPU). The NES PPU was an automation of some of the early computing standards, almost like a hardware ASIC version of `ncurses`. It assumed an 80-character-wide screen, except "characters" were 4x4-pixel tiles stored on a ROM. And combined with a convenient near-miss round-off of the scanline count of an NTSC TV, we get an assumption of a 320x240 screen. (NTSC screens have 525 scanlines, but only 480 of them should be visible. Cut that 480 in half, and you get 240, which *almost* makes a proper aspect ratio with a 320-pixel-wide raster timer.)

So that NES PPU was essentially a terminal formatter, but it addressed character data located on a ROM connected via a cartridge socket. It had enough buffer to store *two* 80x60-tile screens. Tiles used 2-bit color, and were mapped to one of eight palettes, four colors per palette, from a total system palette of 64 (54 usable) colors. It could also handle up to 64 sprites, with the caveat that one single scanline could only have 8 of them on it at a time. And it could rasterize all of that at 60 fps.

If you think that sounds like it basically a graphics engine and not a general GPU, then you're right.

The SNES had the S-PPU, which basically doubled everything, and more. It could handle up to 640x480 output. Sprites were 8x8. There were 16 palettes of 16 colors each, from a system palette of 32768 colors (r5g5b6 format), plus it could auto-compute color additions for transparency effects. There were 4 layers, and the tile buffer was big enough for 2 screens per layer. It could handle 128 sprites, and 16 on a single scanline. And it could still hold a constant 60 fps.

But it was still a tile graphics engine, not a generalized GPU. This time around, there were some raw rasterization features. Mode 7 was one of them. The raster timing could be "tweaked" for a single, contiguous tile-sheet up to 256x256 in size, mapped to a sprite slot. Other modes were mostly just different resolutions, aspect ratios, and framerate locks. In addition to those "modes", there was also a raster interrupt that could be set to call back and overwrite the post-PPU raster buffer at specific timings controlled by the CPU. Games often used these for "magic effects", where big flashy shapes would be drawn over the screen with transparency. They were *costly*, but that doesn't really matter very much for, say, Chrono Trigger during a spell animation. It's already done all of the actual damage calculations, and now it's just showing off with some animated effects. But even with all of that... it's still a tile engine.

That's when the SuperFX shows up on the scene to "fix" the situation in the hackiest way possible. It's a co-processor that *generates tile data* based on the rasterization calculations of polygonal transforms. It essentially does *all* of the 3D work, then slices and dices that picture into little squares so the S-PPU can draw them to the output buffer as boring little tiles. It's a clever hack, but the results were predictably *bad*.

But that design ethos explains why the N64 was so, as you call it, "weird". They weren't building a general purpose gaming system. They were building a game engine in hardware, with all of the features they needed to create the games they wanted to create. They never considered the memory bandwidth, because it wasn't something they needed to use. They didn't consider the *massive* amount of memory textures would use (comparatively) because they thought they weren't using pixel data anymore. Almost every single design decision for the N64 can be traced back to the fact that Nintendo had *never, not even once, built a generalized gaming computer*. They had always made a "hardware game engine".

And that explains the problems they had with the SGI teams that collaborated with them on the N64 design. Those teams were making a generalized gaming computer, and Nintendo *wasn't*.

So when it all blew up in Nintendo's face, and most of their 3rd party developers made threats to leave them, only then did Nintendo take ArtX's advice to make something more generalized. And thus, the Gamecube was born. *And it was overambitious as hell.* Performance-wise, it *soundly spanked* the PS2. It was only marginally less powerful than the Xbox, with its old-but-workstation-class Pentium 3 CPU and moderately-gimped GeForce 2-derived GPU.

The Pentium 3 had, by then, long been matched toe-to-toe with the PowerPC 750, and they were basically equivalent clock-for-clock. Each had a 4-stage pipeline architecture, 2 integer units, 1 FPU, and a beefy ALU with decently modern branch prediction. The only edge the Xbox really had over the Gamecube was its size, which allowed for better cooling and a higher clock rate. An OC'd Gamecube easily keeps up with an Xbox of equivalent clock rate.

And that ArtX GPU design was *damned good*. So good, in fact, that it has basically gone toe-to-toe with nVidia's GeForce line for the last 20 years. You see, ArtX was bought up by ATi. And the design principles that ArtX used in the Gamecube's GX chip became the foundation of the Radeon architecture that revolutionized ATi's product line. (The Rage and Fury lines were hot garbage. Radeon made ATi competitive again.) And that GX chip itself didn't cease production until 2016, when they stopped including it for Wii back-compatibility in the Wii U. That design had legs.

But the PS2? It seems Sony had learned *a little too much* from Nintendo. The Emotion Engine was basically a *hardware game engine*, and fighting with its idiosyncracies caused 3rd party developers *a lot of headaches*. And it wouldn't be until the Cell architecture gimped the PS3 in the same, *stupid*, avoidable way, that 3rd party devs started telling Sony "do it again, and we'll leave your ass like we left Nintendo". Notice how the PS4 stuck to the basics. Yep, there's a reason.

Another example... The Wii. The core of the system was still the same as the Gamecube, but with higher clock rates. But the controller, eventually, *really* hurt it. Sure, everyone thought it was fun at first. But then everyone got *really sick of it* and just wished for a regular controller. And 3rd party devs, again, started to leave Nintendo. Well, some of them. The shovelware devs were super happy to keep shoveling. But meh...

Microsoft cemented their place in that generation. The failure of the PS3, the annoying shovelware and overclocked previous-gen Wii... Xbox 360 capitalized big time. And then the Wii U doubled down on the Wii's bad ideas, and added bad marketing on top. But the PS4 saw Sony come roaring back, and the Xbox One suffered for it. Microsoft is at the mercy of the other two, basically. It doesn't matter what Microsoft does. Both Sony and Nintendo have to suck massive portions of ass in order for Microsoft to gain significant traction in the market.

With the Switch, it seems Nintendo opted for the "generalized gaming computer" again. With Microsoft down (but never out), and Sony focusing on getting the PS5 out the door, the Switch was essentially free to rule the market. And with that head-start, it's not going back to Sony... until the Switch is replaced. Whatever comes next from Nintendo had *better* be good, or else it will fail. But if it keeps full back-compatibility with the Switch... I think that'll be enough.

**TL;DR:** Old Nintendo built lots of hardware game engines, not "real" gaming computers. The fallout of those old design decisions and the market power Nintendo has wielded through the last 4 decades has largely shaped the gaming market today.


Ha well yea there's some truth in that but the costs and time involved to optimise them for specific hardware is prohibitive. Not to mention the ownership of said games...

In the 90s when Nintendo just needed to bang out one amazing, exclusive to them, game per year it was possible. No chance nowadays.

Nintendo will likely continue to diverge from Sony and Xbox which is wise I think. As things go the gamer consoles are really moving toward overlapping with PC gaming market so focus on the handheld/social/family compatible/fun sectors just makes so much sense for the big N.


The steamdeck, as mentioned previously, isn't quite ps4 power, and it only targets 800p, with an fps between 30-60 depending on the game and personal preference.

And it mostly certainly needs a fan. Dunno what dream tech your switch 2 is made out of, but it must be truly a leap forward if the Steam Deck and ROG Ally, the two largest and best selling handheld gaming PCs can't even come close to it


Could be true. I’m sure there are smart folks at Nintendo who are considering all options. 

I made my comment with the understanding that the Nintendo first party IP is so strong and is generally regarded as consistently high sellers. Coupled with the pricing model that Nintendo adopted, I figured they’d be confident in making good returns on the software side


the advancement in chips and storage helped a lot too. Plus the idea of a full-powered handheld tablet device wasn't proven in 2008 when Wii U development started. If development had started three or four years later after Apple debuted the iPad, maybe the Wii U ends up being the switch. Although I doubt if the joy cons would've been possible at that point and it would probably have integrated controllers


I’m a middle aged man with smaller hands and I feel attacked.


It’s gotten to a point where I’ve seen people talk about actual, professional journalists as if they’re known to be inaccurate about leaks because they don’t actively try to leak individual games every few weeks.


I mean, between the Switch V2, Switch Lite and Switch OLED, we did get new hardware like every other year of the Switch's lifespan.  Agree though there was a lot of clickbait about Switch Pro that never came to fruition.


The only deterrent I’ve heard against that, is the general population would look at PS5 vs Switch 2 and think the switch 2 was worse due to the numbering. Which is apparently why Xbox chose to do whatever it is their doing with their nomenclature. I hope they name it properly though, cause Wii U wasn’t clear to consumers that it was an entirely new console.


The implementation was flawless for me, interesting facts on it, thanks. I was very happy it ran so well day one on my Deck for me!


>Super Nintendo Switch

Hrrrrngh oh god I hope they call it this. Or maybe Nintendo Super Switch.

They might be hesitant after the Wii U fiasco, though...


Super Nintendo Switch is actually an awesome fucking name holy shit. I hope they call it that.


RDR2 on launch would make it the first system since the Dreamcast that I get on day 1. They need to do it right though: preorder perks replace Dutch with Waluigi and make Yoshi a horse.


2015 hardware can run TOTK, MK 8 Deluxe at 60fps 1080p, Odyssey as well, and you can't say any of those games look terrible. People forget that Switch has awful hardware at this point, nearly a decade old. There are even Switch games that run better on Switch than Xbox and PS4--very few, but my point is good optimization and effort can lead to outstanding results for crap hardware.


2013 would like a word with Mariokart 8 then. Apparently it was a fake game or something.


Well he is right that Nintendo squeezes out their systems for everything it gots and their art direction is awesome as well. 

I don’t care though how it compares to ps5


I mean to be fair, the Steam Deck is already doing exactly that.


The PS4 is 10 years old, it's really not that crazy


we know its possible theres steam deck we just dont know if its possible for Nintendo to bother lol


The PS4 is ten years old and the rate at which graphics improve has slowed considerably. The PS5 doesn’t always look that much better than PS4 Pro, the differences have become a lot more subtle than in prior generations where graphical leaps were huge. Nintendo has a chance to catch up a bit with this gen, or at least not be so far behind.


Nvidia employees confirmed via tegra Linux kernel updates the Switch 2's SOC (Tegra 239) has an 8 core cpu on a single cluster.

There is exactly 1 current Arm CPU that has that, and it's the Arm cortex A78C, and it nukes jaguars from orbit.


[deleted]


Is this true for their Digital Stores/E-Shops though??


Wii has backward compatibility with Game Cube (except the mini and family editions). It has ports for 4 GC controllers and 2 memory cards, and reads the discs.


They are going with Nvidia because nobody else can provide an ARM chip with the required performance and efficiency. The only company that can make a similar/better chip is Apple. While I would love to see a M2 chip Switch I don't think we are in the correct timeline for something this crazy to happen.


That's the answer as I see it. There is no way Nintendo will release a console that lasts 1 hour on a battery charge, like the Steam Deck does. The only way to have Zen APUs last longer is to reduce their performance. They also lose backwards compatibility and a major differentiator for their console.

I would love to see Apple M1-type performance in a handheld. No fan, amazing performance, and fantastic battery life. Not sure if Nvidia has ARM chips that can rival that, but if they do, holy cow count me in.


I'll correct you not because you're wrong, but because it's insufficient.

In all of Nintendo's cases, backwards compatibility was achieved by including the previous console's processor as a subsystem -- that is, the GBA was an ARM v7 device, the DS was an ARM v9 device that also had an ARM v7 to run GBA games but also to work as a sound processor, and the 3DS was an ARM v11 device that had an ARM v9 to run DS games but also worked as an important coprocessor.

In like manner the Wii's chip was literally a die-shrunk GameCube chip and the Wii U's chip basically had a Wii chip as part of the whole thing.

Switch backwards compatibility with 3DS games actually wouldn't have been all that difficult given that they're both ARM devices; the hard parts would have been what to do with the slow-ass 3DS cartridge interface and (within how the final design ended up being) how to handle dual screen functionality.  But from a marketing perspective, the 3DS was still going and the Wii U was dead, and they wanted to position the new thing where the Wii U was.

Anyway, assuming the new console uses a new Tegra chip (it's most likely the T239) it won't do backwards compatibility exactly the same way it has been done in previous generations -- it'll be done the same way the PS5 does PS4 compatibility, which is that the new processor is capable of running instructions compiled for the old processor.  That's no problem at all for (assuming it's T239) a Cortex A78C to run something compiled for a Cortex A57.  There are hiccups to be had but nothing a dedicated hardware team couldn't handle within the time between chip availability and console launch.


But all of the non backwards compatible consoles came out over 20 years ago


Even if there's backwards compatibility, I don't doubt we'll still see re-releases of Switch games "remastered" for Switch, but not nearly as much as we saw Wii U games.

I've liked the last few years where the focus has been on older titles, like the gamecube/Wii Remasters, and even SMRPG now from the SNES.


There’s talk that the Teal Mask is DLC 1 Part 1 and that there’s still yet to be announced DLC after Part Two.*

Edited for clarity.


So every console they've made with the same game media as the previous generation this century has been backwards compatible, prior to the ps2 only 1 console had backwards compatibility out of the box without a weird and rare adapter (of which the snes had an unofficial one of its own) in western markets (that I know of) and that was the atari 7800 so you can't really begrudge the NES to SNES or SNES to N64 and then the cartridge to disc jump to gamecube for not bucking the trend of the rest of the market. They've done backwards compatibility on every possible console for 2 decades (plus half a point for the gameboy adapter on gamecube). Not really countering their point tbh.


Personally I would love a new double dash gimmick.


You could have said that about literally every single Mario Kart. We need a new Mario kart bro I am so tired of MK8


A whole bunch of new tracks for one. The DLC tracks are fun, i'm enjoying them and hyped to have maple treeway and some of the new characters, but the tour tracks are noticeably graphically inferior as well as just inferior period. Some of them are pretty fun but i would say only maybe 50% of the DLC tracks are really up to standard, and of those they're nearly all tracks from older games.


Yep! The Egg, Triforce, Crossing, and Bell cups were all DLC! They also came with some characters like Link and the Animal Crossing dudes.


Animal Crossing probably saved a few lives


Because most people don’t have more than 1 - 2 TV’ the portableness of it allowed people to game and TV at same time.


If you upgrade to the Switch 2, you can jailbreak your launch switch super easily once you transfer everything over, and use it to play all the games you didn't bother with previously.


Exactly, as a late adopter, I'm not missing out on that again!


Blu-Ray was still super niche when the PS3 came out. Many people were still using CRT TVs when the PS3 was released. The PS3 even predated 1080p TVs.


Of course, that only worked because barely anyone bought a Wii U, so those deluxe ports were basically new games to like 90% of the Switch’s install base. 

If Nintendo tried that strategy again on the Switch 2, I doubt it would work nearly as well, especially with the high likelihood that it’s backwards compatible with Switch 1 games


39 actually, and I mean what I said. The lynx sold 2 million units, thus wasn't a real competitor. The Gear did 10 million, which is better, but not a real competitor. The battery life murdered those devices, and even if they were from respected companies, they never mattered in the actual market. 

The PSP sold 80 million units, and was the first handheld to pose a threat to Nintendo, thus the first device that might elicit a response. Nintendo rightfully understood that all the power in the world didn't matter in a handheld device if you needed a whole suitcase filled with AA batteries to get through a vacation. While the PSP didn't match the DS in battery life either, the move to rechargeable batteries meant at least the extra power didn't dramatically increase the running cost of the device. In the 90's there was a very tangible cost to trying to game on a higher power handheld.


While I agree about the cooling situation, portable gaming PC are not a good benchmark for what the switch 2 will be able to do. Completely different circumstances. From OS, architecture, off the shelf chips, etc. Switch is ARM based, which is much more efficient than x86. With a custom chip, lighter OS, and specific APIs made with Switch in mind, it's not unreasonable to believe that a switch could at the very least match, if not exceed what the current steam deck and ROG do. Add onto that the possibility of DLSS or a proprietary AI upscaling solution.


No one has ever made that mistake until they came out with the Xbox Series X and Series S no one knew what the heck they were talking about. 

Nintendo's naming system is like listening to the ["Who's on first"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ5vspsNS1g) bit.


Super Nintendo Switch would be an awesome name.

But true I wonder if the Wii U will make Nintendo risk-averse to the idea of calling it anything other than Switch 2.

But if they go for Super Nintendo Switch it would be a cool nod to the NES and SNES naming scheme. 

The NS and SNS.


Switch is at lower risk because it doesn't have a thousand peripherals at least.


It’s all contextual. TOTK looks great… for a Switch game. If the game released on the PS4 with the same fidelity and performance issues then people would have blasted the graphics.


There is no fucking way that MK8 is 10 years old.

*checks*

Oh good. It's only nin... OKAY THAT'S NOT MUCH BETTER WTF


And the Steam Deck runs on x86, which is incredibly inefficient when compared to ARM. And let's also not forget that the Steam Deck runs the same exact games as a PC, with very few actual optimisations. So who knows how much better games will run on it than on the Steam Deck?


You can always make a handheld system with a lot of power.That has never been an issue.  Now try making that for $400 or less that includes a TV dock and a wireless controller.


This generation is barely catching it’s legs. Compare a 2014 PS4 game to a 2021 PS4 game, or a 2006 PS3 game to a 2013 PS3 game. The true power of current gen won’t be fully realized for a while.


Hey, I actually never saw it from that POV. The Nintendo userbase is much less welcoming to those types of online models, and GTA V relies heavily on that. This must be the reason.


Well, the DSi let you transfer all of your purchases to the 3DS when doing a system transfer. Wii to Wii U kept track of your purchases but made you repurchase virtual console games at a discount on Wii U (or you could play your old Wii catalog in Wii mode)

Obviously 3DS/Wii U to Switch didn't transfer anything over.


Well most of them didn't have one...


Yeah, the reason we saw so many remasters is because the WiiU failed so hard. No need to remaster Switch games for at least another generation.


Each driver is equipped with a gun


Oh, totally. Also, portability is still useful even just within a household. Jumping from couch to bed to table can come in handy!


Can confirm. I used a tube tv to play my Xbox 360 on until I saved up enough for a small flat screen TV.


completely untrue, 1080p was already a thing by the 6th generation, it just wasn't widely used yet


Their naming hasn’t always been bad. Really in their entire history, the Wii U and New 3DS have been the only truly bad names. Though it would be hilarious if they named it something dumb like the Nintendo Swap or the New Switch. 

Switch 2 would be the safe bet, but Nintendo has literally never just incremented the number. Usually the name conveys what technology or novelty the system represents, which is an unknown at this point aside from rumors about some new camera system.


> which is incredibly inefficient when compared to ARM.

Bizarre and fully disproven myth, they are actually near identical at this point. RISC is not, more or less.

ARM processors in mobile devices have advantages of their whole software stack being made to support power efficient operation. That is where the difference comes from.

In a console, the whole software stack is custom, anyway.


The question is IF you'll get those games. The steam library options are much more open and plentiful compared to a switch.


> Wii to Wii U kept track of your purchases but made you repurchase virtual console games at a discount on Wii U.

Did it? I thought you only needed to do that if you wanted to play it natively in the WiiU. 

You could keep your old Wii VC games and play them in the Wii interface just like your old discs.

It's been awhile though.

Same. My first play through of Skyrim was on a CRT TV.


Admittedly not completely "pre-dated" but 1080p was extremely niche in 2006 and virtually non-existent in consumers homes. I remember one friend who got one in 2007 had a bunch of us over just to watch something on it and we were blown away.

Just look at this article from 2006 discussing Samsung's "new" 1080p format tv at the time time the PS3 was coming out. 1080p was the cutting edge tech just starting to hit the market when the PS3 was released.
https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/samsung-le40m91-and-le40f7-better-than-real-life/

For a more modern point of reference, Sharp sold an 8k TV in 2013. Doesn't mean 8k was an adopted format in 2013.


I like Super Switch.


Yeah, only if you wanted the native version.  Which is dumb, but whatever.

I suspect it has to do with tying purchases to hardware instead of the account.  Now they're tied to account, so at least that excuse is gone.


You could transfer Wii purchases to the virtual Wii on the Wii u for free, but if you wanted those purchases in the Wii u OS you could rebuy them at a severely discounted price. I think it was like 75 to 85 percent off.

I did it for a few titles that I played frequently. Having them on Wii u added miiverse support too, so there were a few small advantages to paying up

Is this really ‘86?   Seems more like mid/late 90s at earliest.


Looks like a Quantel Paintbox which was first launched in '81 and used throughout the 80's and 90's.


I could be entirely wrong, I don't think there's any way that could have been from 1986. That sort of image resolution wouldn't have been possible until the mid-'90s. And even if you could get that resolution in the '80s, the ability to edit it in real time like that seems highly unlikely. I could see this being a demonstration of an extremely expensive setup in maybe, like, 1992 at the earliest.


Didnt even need a computer to remove the towers!


To the folks saying this had to be late 90s and not the 80s, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" was made in 1988! We definitely had the tech it was just extremely expensive! Also Michael Jackson's video for "Leave Me Alone" was 1989 cost a couple mil to make which might not seem alot by how our music videos are these day. Also I believe he paid for that out his own pocket!

This made me laugh a lot!


Lol no. This is very 80s. Photoshop was already in homes by the mid 90s. This was cutting edge, super expensive stuff in 1986. Just like modern VFX is well beyond what  your average home computer can do. 

I’m guessing people upvoting you are younger than 30 lol


Could be a prototype in 1986, yes. By the end of the 1990s this sort of thing was widely available on home PCs.


I had a Magnavox computer in '87 that came with a drawing program.  Everything was a color bitmap, and if you loaded in a picture, you could alter it however you wanted, pixel by pixel.


Judging by the video quality, I'd guess September 2001.


Yep. Unbelievably sophisticated for its time, eye-wateringly expensive (definitely NOT a consumer item, this was TV-studio-budget only) and from 1981 to 1986(ish) the absolutely definitive platform for CGI outside of a dedicated FX studio like ILM. It would be the late 80s before Quantel faced serious market competition from (most notably) Amiga and SGI, and most of their 'advanced' bitmap and video-editing features were cribbed from Quantels' Paintbox software.


I was thinking the exact same thing as you, but it does add up. The tape where this footage is from really did come from 1986, [here’s the youtube link](https://youtu.be/getQ2-mbjWg?si=Q3ZyirW4SwZMcv4o)


This was cutting edge stuff in 1986. That’s the point. It’s showing stuff not available to most people.


It’s not on a home pc, this is running on a mainframe, notice the workstation she is using?

I was developing film at a drug store in the early 90’s and we didn’t even have the ability to print digital pictures. I don’t remember when digital cameras started being popular but it was definitely not in the 80’s.

Pffft, my high-spec PC can run Crysis at 10fps. Don't compare me to you peasants.


Photoshop was already mid 90s on most Macs and Windows 95 computers. We had it already earlier on a Mac in the beginning of the 90s, but that was a Mac SE/30 with 9 inch monochrome display, where you could not do such stuff, of course lol


My first thoughts were an Amiga in HAM mode using something like [PhotonPaint.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_Paint)

We also had a [Fairlight CVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_B1Zk-CQP0) at my highschool (early/mid 80's) which could do various photorealistic realtime video effects.


Yeah, everything in the video that I could reference was before 1986. In the 80’s, we were living in the future!!!


Nice, thanks for the link. I stand corrected.


You are entirely incorrect lol, why spout off random bullshit if you have no idea wtf you're even talking about. Jesus christ you're fucking annoying. Computer graphics started in the *60s* champ, and in the 70s we were making smooth, talking faces, and other moving, detailed graphics. Just watch [this video](https://youtu.be/getQ2-mbjWg?si=PD3tPHi4eKsOpE9M), and maybe you'll learn something instead of just blindly throwing out lies just because you're "pretty sure" it was in the 90s, but you can't even be assed to even do a single google search. 

>You are correct, this is early '90s.

Fuck off lol, you have no clue what you're talking about. Your two cents is putting us in debt haha, ya fuckin dummy


Not really


You fail at everything except sycophancy.


But it *was* in the 80s, champ.... dang. I'm sorry bud, that must hurt, huh. Oof. It sucks to be completely and utterly wrong, doesn't it. I know this might not make any sense for you, I mean look, you were working developing film at some drug store in the 80s! How could you possibly not know about this technology with all that experience right? 

Well, here I am to tell you that you that...well, you're wrong. Now don't get down on yourself, it happens to a lot of people ok? You're not alone in this. But I will say that your statement of, "it was definitely not in the 80s", is entirely false. And based on what is basically zero evidence at all! So for you to come here and tell possibly several hundreds of people that this video is just wrong is, well frankly, quite embarrassing. Because you couldn't even be bothered enough to do a 5 second Google search because why exactly? Oh because you "worked at a drug store in the 80s"? Oh that's right, that must make you an honorary genius then, I see. That must mean that not only was it a job, but it was also a big passion of yours to learn about digital pictures and editing, picture storage and printing, all that stuff, correct? It wasn't just a job to you? Well, I'm not sure who your photo printing drug store professor was, but they were 100% wrong unfortunately. You actually have no clue what you're talking about, yet you write it off as indisputible fact because, "MEH, DruG sTorE, BLeGh". 


Yeah. Right, lol. Why don't you just fuck off. Find yourself a napkin and wipe that shit coming from your mouth, genius

Gamersnexus did a nice benchmark: https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3346-thermal-paste-application-benchmark-too-much-thermal-paste


X for the win


Wait? It goes on the top?


Cool to watch but for most cpus it doesn’t matter what method is used. Which has been proven by various media outlets


I've always done a small centralized zigzag. X pattern from now on it is.


X marks the spot.


X looks good, but since the paste is room temp, wouldn't it spread out if I were to try the other methods?
My logic says that all of the methods are fine, but I'd love to hear other opinions.


https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3346-thermal-paste-application-benchmark-too-much-thermal-paste


I think it depends on the good quantity, not just on the technique.


As a Pc master race I prefer Verge thermal paste applications.


But did you use your thermal paste applicator??


Pea sized dot, really hits the spot.


the last one is the best


Liquid metal has you spreading it thin and over the whole heatspreader before mounting and I'm never going back to normal paste again. Crazy good temps too.


Isn't this also not a proper representation because of the extra pressure applied from screwing in the heatsink vs applying it only by hand?

I wish I'd known this 20 years ago. That was around the time I started a job where my new manager gave me a box of parts and told me to build my own workstation. Despite being a programmer for over a decade at that point, I'd never bothered to build a PC. I learned quickly enough (I had plenty of help from everyone else in the office), but I didn't realize just how critical that connection between CPU and heatsink was. My machine kept shutting down on me until I fixed that problem.


Welp, this GIF will spawn more thermal paste misconception than there already is.

Edit: Since I'm getting messages on why this GIF maybe be missinforming some users. I'll elaborate a little. I'm on mobile, it's 6:30am, and I just got off work so bare with me.

Some PC users don't know is that thermal paste is actually a poor heat conductor. It doesn't transfer heat as well as copper would. So why use thermal past then? Because thermal past can do one thing copper can't. It can spread. The main purpose of the thermal paste is to fill micro gaps between the processor and the base of the heatsinks. The surface of the processor is not flat and neither is the heatsinks base. You use the paste to increase the efficiency of the copper to transfer heat by filling in the gaps.

So when you apply the "X" like in the GIF. You didn't fill in the gaps. You created a layer between the processor and  coppe, which in turn you will more than likely be thermal throttling the cpu because the paste won't transfer the heat efficiently.

Does this mean the x pattern and the = pattern are the most effective? Whats the take away?


Want the perfect spread? X gonna give it to ya.


honestly, it doesnt really matter what shape you use imo. just apply enough to get everything covered. from the looks of it, the x used the most paste and probably spilled some over the edges.


Yeah this is really cool. X’s only from now on.

Edit: I didn’t even consider the tension of an actual heatsink, don’t listen to my ramblings.


This is all well and good, but where are the numbers to back each of the various methods up?


I'll save this post. Hopefully I'll be able to build a PC from me very own hard earned money in a year or two :)


the X did the job well.


Ok so, X


X goin give it to ya.


I thought pea was best but X is best

X To the Z xzibit


As someone who isn't very well versed in building PC's. Is the X the best method?


so basically use X


Here's your friendly reminder that you want AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE thermal paste!

Thermal conductivity of top-end thermal paste products is usually around 10-12 W/mk, with averages around 6-8 W/mK (watts per meter-kelvin).

Thermal conductivity of aluminium is around 200 W/mK, and of Copper around 380 W/mK.

Thermal paste is, at best, about 5% of conductivity of the stuff you're trying to thermally connect. The only thing paste beats in conductivity is *air*, which means you only need enough paste to fill up small air pockets between the two imperfect surfaces (CPU/GPU top cover and heatsink contact). Any more than that, and it's effectively a thermal barrier between your two expensive components.

Quickly googled sources: [Thermal paste tests](https://www.wepc.com/reviews/best-thermal-paste/), [aluminium and copper conductivity](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/thrcn.html).

TLDR: Don't go fuckin' The Verge on your shit. In fact use less than in this demo. 

EDIT FOR CLARITY: 

I did not say "use too little". "Little as possible" != "Use too little". I am not telling you "do the wrong thing!" which apparently some people think I do. 

I used the conductivity numbers to try to break apart the mentality that, since thermal paste helps cool down stuff, more thermal paste is better. That's exactly the mindset that dude from The Verge video had. 

Admittedly now that I re-read what I wrote I made it seem like if you use more paste than necessary, you will create a thermal barrier and lower your thermal performance. This is not true. Thermal performance is more or less exactly the same across the board regardless of thermal paste amount (except way too little). Using "too much" is bad in the sense of making a mess, wasting paste, or destroying components. NOT in the sense "you will get less cooling". 

Point of the story is: There is such as thing as too little thermal paste. There is such a thing as too much thermal paste. Both of these amounts are lower than you probably think. 

That's it, have a nice day y'all.


Thermal paste is a gap filler. It’s not the peanut butter in a sandwich. 

I’ve always applied a very thin layer and scraped 99% of it off with a credit card. The thermal paste is only meant to fill in the micro pores of the two metals where they are not touching at all.


There seems to be a common misconception here that the goal with thermal paste is to cover the entire CPU surface. A little bit goes a long way and there is such a thing as too much thermal paste.


This demo is meaningless without showing the results after a few hours of use. When the dies heat up, the compound will spread further.  Everyone of those with paste at the edge of the processor will result with compound over the edges and potentially in the pin connectors after the first few hours of use.

This is why the pea sized drop method is recommended by OEMs as the "safest". It covers enough enough of the cores that need thermal transfer and is the least likely to spread beyond the edges.


I used to spend ages spreading it meticulously to cover every square mm of the cpu with a layer thin enough so it doesn't ooze out of the side when the heatsink was placed on, yet enough to be effective. That X method just made me re-think those hours lost.


The third way is not good. The paste went on the sides of the processor.


The pea is key gentlemen, the pea is key.


But theirs no performance difference with them right?


This processor is dead.


I usually just put it directly on the pins


You put the paste in between , fucking noobs.


I don't know about you guys, but this is the most erotic thing I've ever seen.


Would of tought pea sized blob would be better... Maybe some more paste and it would. Def gonna use x from this on. I have spread it to this point but it's messy.

Edit: I will never just press tho. I'll allways wiggle the heatsink some for good spread. Have worked from build one.


X marks the (sweet) spot.


So X IS gonna give it to yah? Total coverage that is.

It's not easy (or maybe legal) to find 100% isopropyl alcohol in where I live, so I can only imagine the hard work it would take with just watered down 70% rubbing alcohol


I always spread it manually before I apply the HSF...
Maybe that's just from starting with arctic silver back in 1999...


and now I understand why the PC i tried to build 5 years ago kept dying over and over in bf3. I didn't put the thermal paste on right. It called for just a dab so that's all I put.


why didn't any of the tech youtubers do this...


X is always the best, as long as you know right amount


Seems like X gonna give it to ya


Yo i never knew the x one was so perfect


So, it sure looks like the X method is the best. Damn. I used the dot method. Makes me want to go back and redo it. *Palms and forehead start sweating*.

Is the one by “calledtim” on YouTube that has “REUPLOAD” in the title the correct one?
Edit: 41 seconds in, this is the one


Yo dawg we heard you like thermal paste so we applied thermal paste over your pre-applied thermal paste so you can thermal paste. Kidding aside, Damn that was a hard watch.. Default pre-applied tp on AIO is just fine for the type of build he did.


Yeah the missed the best one


This will never not be funny


OK, do you have a swiss army knife?


Tl;dr: as long as you don't use a tiny amount it really doesn't matter as long as it's enough. For huge CPUs like threadrippers it's a bit different because the IHS is bigger.


Every time someone post anything related to thermal paste there will be a lot of people claiming they know the the best and true way of applying it.. 

It's a joke at this stage.. With several benchmarks like this one proving that as long as you apply enough it won't matter at all.. Thanks for posting it


Thank you !


I wish they would repeat it with Ryzens. It would be interesting to know if something changes if the main heat source is not at the center but to the side of the CPU.


IIRC, when benchmarking they always spread a thin layer across the entire top, because it works fine and it's the most easily repeatable for consistency sake.  As a custom pc builder from back in the 33mhz days, that's how we used to do it. I did it like that up until I bought Arctic Silver 5 for a core2, and their manual said that according to their testing the dot or line variant was best depending on what chip you had.

You're telling me.


na it spreads more with heat so its to much


X gonna give it to yuh !


No, these guys are just idiots, if you smear it on top it will only take heat from the outside of the cpu, you gotta smear it on the pins to get all that heat trapped in the center


So this is the PC my teammates play on

It goes in your mouth. You have to gargle it for 30 seconds before you drip it on the CPU, the solution is designed to interact with your spit to form a pliable paste. Doesn't anyone read what's on the tube anymore?


It goes on top and bottom. This is them just showing the top. The bottom improved contact between the pins and pads


This hurt to read


As long as it isn't the Verge method or the 'I forgot to remove the plastic from the heatsink.'


But would adding the CPU after it has been flattened like this work as well?


None of these go up to actual mounting pressure.

It also spread more as it gets thinner from heat.

The X is too much.


It doesn't matter, I can't stress this enough.  

Its been tried, tested, and retested by multiple people over the years.   The differences in thermal performance based off application method is so insignificant as to be beyond negligible if not basically identical.  

Just want to get it done fast?  Put a proper sized drop in the center and be done with it.  

Want to do it as optimally as possible?  Put a slightly large amount on, then spread it out over the surface like you are icing a cake.  It takes longer and the differences are negligible but its been shown to have slightly better performance (like not even a full degree).  

Anything in between?  Why bother.  It doesn't matter it will do the job just fine either way and unless you just like making shapes with your thermal paste for voodoo rituals just stop fucking around with it and get it done...  IT DOESN'T MATTER!  

I think people overly obsess over thermal paste because its the only thing that isn't basically just over glorified legos when it comes to putting a computer together.


Kunkka is my name!


As long it's enough to cover the die, and not so much it spill's the application method is entirely irrelevant.


All methods are fine, until you put so much that it spills.


This is in every test I've seen, the most important factor.


I unironically use the applicator to spread the paste as even as possible, like the last method. IDK, it just works


A grain of rice is good for the mice.


I used to do that but it's just unnecessary work. As you could see in the video a simple dot will do just as well and is way faster and less messy.

Besides, if you check actual temperature comparisons, there's really no measurable difference between any of those methods.


Absolutely, use a card or something and smear it over the whole die.
Smear gang 4 lyfe.


It's an absolute bastard to remove tho


[deleted]


Yes, and also because the flexibility of the acrylic isn't the same as that of copper.


Yeah, they used varying amounts and no where near enough pressure. If you put on enough paste, when you tighten your heatsink it won't matter what pattern you used, it's going to get spread out over the die regardless. 

This misleading gif is just going up continue the useless debate that's been debunked time and time again.


[deleted]


> so when you apply the "X" like in the GIF. You didn't fill in the gaps. You created a layer between the processor and coppe, which in turn you will more than likely be thermal throttling the cpu because the paste won't transfer the heat efficiently.

I'm sorry what? How is that any different from any other techniques? you're obviously filling the gaps. 

Do you mean to say he applied to much paste? Which is probably true but that has nothing to do with the shape of the application. You could do a cross with much lesser paste.


Yikes, here is another person with the even worse misconception,

You will NEVER manually be able to apply thermal paste in a way that only fills in the imperfections between the two flat surfaces of the IHS and heatsink. 

If you apply too little though, you will have a high possibility of having air gaps within these imperfections.

So with this "common" sense out of the way, you can see the optimal way of getting as much heat conductivity as possible is to apply more than enough thermal paste. This way all of the imperfections will be flattened with a layer of paste ensure more contact area. 

This is where you got to. But going on, when you install the heatsink, you will create downwards pressure onto the IHS. This pressure is your friend and will squeeze  the excess thermal paste out the sides(how this isn't obvious to people is beyond me). This way you have 100% filled in all imperfections between the two surfaces without having to guess the exact amount, and the additional paste you added is not creating a thicker layer than needed. 

Unless the amount of paste you added was significantly more than required, you will not cause issues with anything doing this. A tiny amount of paste may be around the edges of the IHS, that is all.


[deleted]


This is incredibly wrong


Ironically, you're also spreading misinformation. In theory what you say about a "thin layer" makes sense, but in practice the differences are negligible, and far from "making CPUs thermal throttle". Read this: https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3346-thermal-paste-application-benchmark-too-much-thermal-paste


It shows different ways of applying thermal paste on the CPU before attaching the cooler. Poor distribution leads to bad thermal conductivity and therefore to overheating and/or reduced lifetime of the CPU. Excessive amounts of thermal paste however can also reduce thermal conductivity or can leak and damage the CPU and other components.


Don't. This video is misleading. They're not applying close to how much pressure a real heatsink would apply, the X is too much.


Gamers nexus did one and it made no difference


Instead of this paste, you can learn from Linus:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2MEAnZ3swQ

tl;dw, technique doesn't matter, no such thing as too much, but don't use too little.

That said, good luck and enjoy! And remember: *read the manual!*


What is the "The Verge on your shit" mean? I am out of the loop. 

Also do you think a smaller plus would work? It would be similar to the large X except not spread as far. Just a small + in the center sort of similar to the grain of rice method.


Here's your friendly reminder that USING TOO MUCH thermal paste doesn't matter!

It literally squeezes out the side with the mounting pressure of the heatsink. Unless you are using liquid metal or another conductive paste, there is more chance for issues if you apply too little, rather than too much.

Yep.  This demo is really disingenuous, because it spreads far better after being heated.  As long as you use enough it'll spread fine, and the conclusion in that video (IIRC) was that you can't really use too much, unless the particular motherboard has conductive components near the cpu socket, and your thermal paste is also conductive.


The thing with Threadripper and Ryzen 3000 chips is that the dies are distributed across the interposer, not just centred in the middle like old chips.

I have a theory that because the content we view usually focuses on experienced people performing at an intermediate or high level, newcomers feel a pressure to meet that benchmark instead of focusing on completion at the level of a beginner.

So when we see competitive overclockers painstakingly looking for 1-2 degree drops, we somehow think that we should do that as well, even though it won't make a difference in real world conditions.

I think the takeaway is that people should focus on what success looks like for them, and what will be fun for them, and focus on that for the best personal results.


Yeah, realistically it doesn't matter how much or what method you use as long as your temps are good. I use the pea method and dont have temps above 60 c with my noctua cooler.

No idea why you are downvoted when an x is clearly way too much


Ahhhh there it is.  Petty argument triggered.


to much is no issue.


Dont forget to flatten all of those pins down as well. I dont know why they bother putting them on there in the first place?


Yes. Get rid of the heat at its roots


Dear god I hope someone doesn’t take this seriously lmao


Yup. Put it on the MOBO. Those holes, think of them as waffles and the thermal paste is the syrup. The pins go in the holes, coating them. Heat dissipates. Science.


My tiny mind got confused for a second there.


No this is incorrect. Everyone knows that the pins are what makes the heat so you have to cut them all off before installing and then you don't even have to put any paste on.


Yeah I can back this up. I coated my CPU pins in thermal paste and now I can keep frozen foods inside my PC case. Works great


As a PC noob, this is a joke right?


This is on /all/ now - I would add a /s  so someone doesn't go and actually do this...


Put some on everything, to prevent heat from even getting close to the cpu, put some on the gpu, on the fans, on the ram, and even on the case!


Don't forget that only electrically conductive grease works.

But the plastic adds aesthetic tho


even the verge method likely doesn't do worse than the usual methods. The mounting pressure will just press out whatever's too much, there won't be much of a difference. Is it a waste of thermal paste? yes. Will it be a mess to clean up? yes. Will it impact performance? [more than likely not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUWVVTY63hc)


Removing plastic from heatsinks still triggers me. My first PC was completely built, til I realized I might've forgotten that plastic. Took off the cpu fan to see my cpu wasnt there, it was stuck to the fan. Tried taking it off the fan only to drop the cpu and bent the pins and cpu itself. 

There was no plastic either


You risk catching an air bubble between the CPU and cooler.

Source:  Me, building my first PC, then wondering why it crashed every five minutes.  I thought spreading it first would help, when my friend came over to diagnose there was a spot right in the middle of the cooler that hadn't touched the paste at all, maybe 1.5cm across!  Lesson learned.


The first time I installed my own PC I didn’t know how much paste you were supposed to use. So I used the whole tube and just smeared it out all over the whole CPU.

Never did that mistake again.

edit: holy smokes this got more attention than expected, nice surprise 6hrs later! 
To answer your questions, I cleaned up the mess with a lot (like, **a lot**) of Q-tips, rubbing alcohol and a whole bunch of patience. 
Fortunately everything survived, just got very very messy haha.


X has way more than the pea also, so just add more to the pea and its fine


This. Hand loading is nowhere close to the tightening by screws. Single dot is almost close to edges when pushed by hand and will be covering complete surface when tightened. Also the layer thickness would be less because of less quantity, and better heat flow


There has been more in depth testing done which also suggests that the x pattern is the best also due to the way it spreads the X pattern not only gives a more uniform spread it also pushes out more air as it does spread. Also the testing done in this link also has the mounting pressure.

Like butter on toast.
I haven't built a computer in 10 years, but I always spread a layer as even as I could with a razor blade.


And you need only 3 minutes.


I think the insinuation is that the X appears to have a slight excess of paste, they're not suggesting the X will break it or anything but out of all of them it did appear to have the most paste on the CPU. As explained thermal paste isn't there to be the primary remover of heat, it's there as the redundancy for the inevitable bumps and dips in the surface of the processor and whatever you're using to cool it as there are areas where the two pieces of copper don't touch. In an ideal scenario we'd have two surfaces that touch absolutely seamlessly and would have no need for paste whatsoever but that's for all intents and purposes impossible if you want your product to be financially viable and quick to process.

The Verge made a "Build your own PC" tutorial, and the guy that did it basically did everything that could be done wrong.

 1 of the things was the the thermal paste bit, he had a CPU cooler with pre-applied thermal paste but commented that it is usually not enough then added his own blobby mess to the CPU itself and combined them.

* Advising people to put even more thermal paste on top of already existing thing it comes on a fresh heatsink (hence joke)
* Incorrectly using long screws on a watercooler's fan block in such a way it could actually piece the pipes and damage the thing
* Shit ton more I can't remember right now off the top of my head --- ninja EDIT: Oh yeah mounting the PSU in fuckin' *backwards* so it's not getting any air!

👍 *The Verge liked this*


The gamer nexus article is interesting too because they purposely included a "mistake" that tons of first time builders stress over - not covering the entire IHS. 

They left a corner uncovered in the pea size test and the numbers were just fine. It's a nice reinforcement for new builders that everything will be OK. Just go for it.

But it spreads so much heat with the X and might spill over once tightened, so is it better for the two lines or just a simple dot?


Because there is no such thing as too much unless you literally have it squirting onto your motherboard. The pressure of the heatsink creates a thin layer by spreading the paste out. Not sure how this isn't common sense at this point...

I have done the pre-spread method on literally hundreds of CPUs. I have never ended up with a bubble or thermal issues as a result.

It really doesnt matter how you do it, so long as youre getting full coverage. Come to think of it, I dont believe I have ever seen a bubble between a sink and an CPU, when not using waaayyy too much compound.


If you spread it right, it's actually the best method but using the classic x or blob is easier to perform with a lower risk of mistakes like this air bubble.

I've done that. It spooged out over the edges. 

But nothing bad happened so...


I ended up using that method last time without intending to use the whole tube, but that's what it took to achieve full cover. You think I should redo it? The thing making me reluctant is the cooler is an absolute bitch to put on. It's the 3700x with stock cooler. I think I might just leave it until I've had it a year and then upgrade the cooler.


What's wrong with just going with the X and add that much paste?


Anything that reached the edge in this demo would definitely be squeezed over under real application.


This should be it's own post.


Cool article, I'll switch to an X next time I apply!

Also:
"Perhaps our most interesting result is that if you are going to use the tried-and-true rice sized dot, you might as well have a bit of fun and draw a little happy face instead. Not only does it cool just as well, but you can rest easy knowing that you have a happy, smiling CPU underneath your heatsink"


10 years ago or so I checked "how to put thermal paste" and somewhere it was saying to put the size of a coffee bean in the middle. Been doing that since then without any heating issue and everytime I removed the cpu I saw the paste was evenly distributed. Last month I had to do it and I put a too much big coffee bean. It spilled, I wiped the excess paste and it is all good.


It's funny over the last 20 years (as PC building has become more popular) people have forgotten *why* you don't want to add "too much" thermal paste. It has nothing to do with performance it's literally just so you don't have to clean a gooey mess.


If your CPU is glued, surely you’ll be screwed. It will not conduct, you’ll be really fucked. The heat will not deplete, and you will overheat. Your PC will not posts, your CPU will roast and then it will be toast.


I do at work. Anyways, you're right that it doesn't really matter when you do it at home for your own PC every few years when you upgrade your CPU.


The heat is distributed throughout the whole ihs, not just the center.


That is ***completely*** unnecessary, though, and is the point.

Wow, did you see his [response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn0Kru9PBOk)?  I wouldn't hold the first video against the guy for just not knowing any better, but seeing the criticism bounce off his skull like that is *funny*.  Particularly enjoy that quasi-gatekeeping thing he says about it being a nicer computer like it's harder to plug in a more expensive graphics card or like he even paid for it in the first place.


This is the video I like the best - [the mega cut build and criticism](https://youtu.be/M-2Scfj4FZk).


Wait so not only did he put WAY too much, it was in addition to the thermal paste that comes with the stock heatsink? wtf.


I don't build PC's all that often, but CPU first (and M2 drives nowadays) seems like the sensible choice. It has no pre-requisites and doesn't alter the shape or maneuverability of the motherboard at all, so why wouldn't you get it out of the way immediately?

The CPU cooler's installation order, on the other hand, is pretty crucial and I've never *not* been disappointed in my choice no matter when I did it. It's always "this piece of shit is preventing me from reaching that fucking thing" or "this fucking thing is blocking that piece of shit", where *piece of shit* and *fucking thing* are interchangeable codenames for the heatsink, any screw, a ram stick, the back panel, power cables or literally anything else.


It's not even an antistatic wristband (which would have a conductive plate contacting skin), it's a livestrong bracelet.


My favorite part is the anti vibration "insulating pads" and then he screws the PSU to the case.


Don't forget the tweezers.


apparently it can protect you from static.


Wasn't there a study done a while back about how as long as your thermal paste is applied properly, and the PSU has enough airflow, the rest of the airflow is largely insignificant and perfect cable management, using rounded cables vs ribbon, etc has absolutely no bearing on the actual temperatures?  
  
In other words, the study showed that there's only two things you need to do right for good temps, and he fucked them both

Well, it is important. The type you use isn't important for most applications, and the material isn't that important as long as it's thermally conductive.

Plugging cables into electrical components gives PC builders a false sense of intelligence.


That assumed the pressure is strong enough which the video above shows it is not.  If the paste had lower viscosity, it would have covered the entire die protector instead of remaining a disc.

20 years ago when I was lapping my custom loop water-cooling block and obsessing over 0.5 C changes, my personal experience and all websites showed a .5-1C improvement from careful thin film of thermal paste spread across the entire surface of the die protector

Is 1C alone important?  No.  But there is a difference.   1C from careful paste application, a few C from removing the die protector (I refuse to call it a heat spreader because it actually acts as an insulator compare to no spreader), a few C from adjusting the water pump pressure, and you're running 15c cooler.

The paste is just there to bridge the gap between the CPU and the cooler. A really thin paste-layer moves the heat from the CPU to the cooler faster since it's less material for the heat to travel through. That and to much can spill over causing a mess, and if you use a paste that is conductive it can fry the MOBO


Every benchmark shows that it makes no difference so just do whatever you want


So would the best shape be a mini-x in the center that extends 50% of the way to the edges?


go for it


He's not disputing that, he's just saying the die is small and under the middle of the ihs.


I'm aware


Of course, thats why I said they weren't insinuating the X method would break it, just that it's going to add to more misinformation with people seeing this and arguing the X method is the only one that does the job properly because this gif uses different amounts of paste for each method of application and the X method is the only one here that covers it (This is before you take into account the obvious shortfalls of trying to mimic the pressure applied from all of the tightening screws with your hands)

His computer did *work* but he wouldn't have gotten the full potential out of his components. 

His 2 ram sticks were installed in the wrong slots so he won't get their full potential, bubbles in the thermal paste could ensure that his CPU thermal throttles earlier, the PSU getting installed with its' fan against a wall could cause it to thermal throttle, just shut itself off, or catch fire/melt itself depending on the model, he ran the wrong screws into the water cooler and could have damaged or punctured one of the cooling veins, the list goes on.

Basically he made every single mistake which could have been very easily avoided by reading the short little manual that comes with each of those components.

Lol exactly this, I went from like 'Ok, he doesn't really know what he's talking about' to 'this guy is a fucking idiot' when he talked about the PSU being 'insulated' by the pads before screwing it *straight onto the fucking case*. What a complete moron.

Like everyone doesn't lose the whole tube after using it once anyway.


Yeah, essentially. As long as you cover the middle you're good. 

For something like a Threadripper it's more important to get full coverage, but that's because they have multiple chips spread over the cpu - you want to make sure you cover all the chips.

It happened to me when I assembled my first PC with the help of my friend. He was going to put the paste on the CPU and blacked out and put it on the contacts on the CPU. I think he just blacked out hahaha. 

But what happens is the motherboard just wont boot.

And if you've tried booting it with the paste on the wrong side, chances are there is some paste stuck in the pins on the motherboard. If that is the case, you can take some highproof alcohol (90+) and a toothbrush to try and gently cleaning it out if you want to salvage the motherboard.

In my case we accidentaly bent the pins on the motherboard aswell (Yes, this whole ordeal was a living nightmare) so I had to replace the brand new motherboard lol. 

But in short, the CPU will be fine, just rub the paste of the connectors with some highproof (90+) alcohol and you are gucci.

It's the motherboard you should be worried about.


Almost guaranteed it wouldn't catch fire, but it would most likely destroy both the CPU and motherboard.


Hello! Welcome to the top of r/all. Interesting sub you have here.


You don't?


Thermal paste? No. PCs? Absolutely ;)


If you don’t then you’re on the wrong sub, fella.


most high quality pastes are not conductive at all (e.g. kyronaut), they won't do anything bad to your components.

cooler and cpu will never be in fully contact with another, there will always be a thin layer of air inbetween, which is bad because the thermal conductivity of air is pretty bad. Quality thermal paste has one of 8-13 W/(mK), so you are basically forcing this layer of air out and negating all the points you mentioned as well


In theory, the only thing happening with quality paste is a mess, those are non conductive and well functioning. With enough pressure you should be able to force the excessive paste out which will result in a mess, but is still better than too little paste (imo).

Using liquid metal is another thing tho, with this you can really fuck things up


Bullshit.

That's not what actual tests show. They show that there's no downside from "too much cooling paste". There *is* however a downside to not having enough.

Linus Tech Tips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2MEAnZ3swQ 

There are more videos like this, with same results.


The die of the CPU is much smaller than the heat sync that covers it. Basically any one of these will cover more area than the die. So a small x really isn't even necessary. A pea sized in the middle is more than enough.

Depends on the motherboard. Some require in pairs or it only reads one.

Yeah, that case plug adapter is a life saver. I hate plugging those stupid things in.


I didn't, that's awful.


Yeah, I know about the LTT video but I seem to remember that video inspiring an actual study that confirmed the results in a more scientific setting.  
  
I'll admit, I *may* have dreamt that study, as I've been having some extremely vivid dreams lately that have been working their way into my memory as actual events and I've had to triple check whether or not they ever happened at all.


Maybe not as relevant in a modern build, but I've seen tons of PCs at work get gunked up with dust to the point of turning the fan into a rocket ship or even shutting off

I have a BS in computer Engineering and I RMA'ed a PSU because I thought it would do something when not under load, and had the power switch plugged in wrong from the case. Double whammy and a dumb dumb brain.


Story time. Friend of mine wanted to get into PC gaming, I helped him pick out the parts for his budget and told him I would help him build it and go through the steps with him, been building PCs for 20 years now. The day he gets the parts, I'm showing him how the CPU works, line up the corner triangle on the CPU with the corner triangle on the motherboard, insert, lock, great. Now time for the cooler, but this cooler has a back plate, no problem, stand up the case to get access to the back, and in the LOCKED position this CPU just straight up fell out of the motherboard and onto the ground. A brand new Ryzen 3700X with five bent pins on it. We spent the next 3 hours with a tweezers and a magnifying glass slowly and painstakingly trying to straighten out those pins enough to fit inside the mobo, we eventually did, but I promised myself I would never help anyone with a build ever again in the middle of all that.


yes


man's not hot


If you have to ask, does it matter ?


Nah, I’ll go with chocolate, it has the highest score, a whole 75 points!


Well that 'paste' is Helman's mayonnaise and it's quite conductive according to this

Wouldn't thermal paste be the cum shot?


I’ve been using it as lube


[deleted]


Most thermal compounds aren't directly conductive, but they can still be capacitive and cause some real issues if gooped down into the socket.


The die of the cpu spreads heat to the entire cpu cover, not just the center, and that cover spreads heat to the entire cpu cooler/heatsink. Linus did a test on amounts of thermal paste and results showed it was better to go over instead of under when applying it. If linus' test wasn't enough, here's another by gamers nexus. Pea size is the worst one, by a very insignificant amount. https://youtu.be/EUWVVTY63hc?t=733


But on Ryzens, because of the chiplet design, the DIEs (and so their thermal hotspots) are NOT in the middle. 

I still prefer the classic method with a spatula.


Uhhhh you mean tweezers, I don't even know what a zip tie is

how dare you me go back to rewatch from the beginning


Wow it does get worse


Yeah, there's a lot of difference between the system posting, and the system performing. And he won't acknowledge any of it.


But even then, this was supposed to be an educational video and he clearly did 0 research. Even if it was his first build, putting that misinformation out there is really shitty


In a nutshell:

* Most consumer motherboards have 4 RAM slots
* Most consumer CPUs utilize "dual channel" RAM, which basically means they can access two separate RAM sticks at the same time (very simplified explanation)
* For dual channel to work, you have to put the RAM in the correct slots.  If you have 4 identical sticks to fit in all 4 slots, it doesn't matter.  But often, you'll only have two sticks.  The motherboard manual will tell you which two slots to use to enable dual channel.

This is very basic stuff, and anyone that glanced at their "quick setup guide" pamphlet that came with the motherboard or RAM would know about it.


Usually if you have 4 slots and you want to install 2 sticks, they go into the (1 and 3) or (2 and 4) position.


But you check the manual.


No, they're not. A lot of computers these days are dual channel. This essentially means that you have the ability to have two channels of communication with your RAM meaning better performance. This means, if you're only using 2 sticks of ram, filling half your slots, you need to make sure they're in the correct slots to take advantage of the dual channel memory. That way one stick is in one channel and one stick is in the other.

Newer motherboards and CPUs now support quad channel memory.


They went back and fixed things without showing it but didn’t bother editing the video. So many people involved literally did not even care that it was inaccurate.


Yo, that sounds terrifying.

Yeah, good dust filters are a must. Especially if it's an office setting with a *lot* of people nearby since that adds dead skin cells to the dust, and anywhere with pets adding hair, dander, feather particles, etc.      
  
You can have shitty cable management that doesn't allow hardly any airflow and be fine, but dust gets *inside* your fans and makes them slow down or work harder which can burn out the motor.


I do this. I've got a few boxes of bits and parts spanning the better part of a decade now.


I keep everything in the tower box. Takes up more room in storage but then I can ship the PC when I need to.


I keep all my stuff in one place. But like a potato, if you keep things sitting long enough, they grow limbs and make their way to everywhere BUT the place you put them. Either that, or they end up in the same realm as that other sock.

Thermal paste gets pressed out from the contact surfaces. There's no "too much" as demonstrated by Gamers Nexus. Only risk is with conductive paste going over components when overflowing.


I miss the good old days where we hand lapped the cooler contact surface, tinted the cooler surface, and spread paste on with a razor.

Not really that was a pain in the ass.


Yeah tf is a zip tie? Tweezers are the best for cable management,also make sure you don’t touch your PSU or you might short circuit it


I was quoting Lyle. Not the verge guy who called zip ties tweezers. Lol


Zip tie is for the pp

It kind of is. Especially coupled with a bit of minor brain damage from quitting heroin cold turkey after 14 years. I suffer from something called PAWS (Post-Acute-Withdrawal Syndrome) which caused large memory gaps. I have entire months of my life that are completely missing, including having supposedly been in a band that did some local shows. I was contacted by someone on Facebook one day about the band and I was like "sorry, you've got the wrong person, I've never been in a band", and she replied with pictures of me on stage and it was *definitely* me. That's probably one of the most unsettling things I've ever experienced; seeing a picture of myself doing something I could never imagine having done. I legit threw up.  
  
So now imagine having such vivid dreams that you sometimes don't remember they weren't real, *and* finding out you've done things that you can't even remember doing. I still have people coming up to me, talking about parties in my small town and talking about things I've done that I don't remember doing.

What are we giving?


Gimme


I'm afraid not but I can tell you I didn't expect to be googling "is mayonnaise electrically conductive?" today.


I miss the days of exposed dies and spreading the paste on perfectly thin and evenly. Followed by holding your breath as you attached the heatsink and prayed you didn’t chip the die.

I actually do miss that because I was good at it and knew how much paste to apply.


Oh lol, I didn't remember that line. There were just too many


I’ve been getting the exact “Dream to memory” phenomenon as I’ve been heavily cutting back on my stimulant use (amphetamine/various Stim RCs).
It seems like it occurs less the longer I go sober but the first 3-7 days have me dreaming for what feels like literal days of my actual life (in actuality the dreams *are* 12+ hours but the continuity of having only one single dream for the entirety of those 12+ hours is whats fucky).

The one time I check if it's a one-time-i-dreamt post it’s not.


Absolute king shit.


Me initially reading tanks to mean the military variant: is this a once-i-dreamt post?


This is more impactful than any short story I read in my college English classes.


How large is a big clam exactly


I don't know why but for some reason I assumed this was a wild west piece and started reading it in a specific "Western movie narrator" voice, which makes this even funnier somehow.


He’s got a baby monitor on that clam???


I have no clue what this is actually about because my eyes kept snapping back to "nibbling my toes through my open heels" because my brain refused to let it go.


My thoughts  
1. Why would a store sell saltwater it's free from the ocean

2. Oh it's probably saltwater taffy

3. who has one tank, let alone 16.

4. check the url to see if it's one-time-i-dreamt

5. is the clam piloting the tank or?

6. oh it's a fish store


I read this out of order because I read the words “stare in awe at this man’s gigantic clam” and immediately wondered why this post was about trans men


this is so sweet i hope that clam is doing good


For context [here](https://www.reef2reef.com/threads/largest-clams-in-private-aquariums.333634/) is a forum thread dedicated to large clams in home aquaria


Reads like Murakami


Me, instinctually putting the word “taffy” after “saltwater” and remaining cripplingly confused


My dumbass thought we were referring to the number of tanks. I was wondering who the fuck could fit 120 tanks into an office.


If heaven doesn't have the snorfling collies and great clam dads I, for one, don't care to go.


Man had the clam cam on deck


i bet the clam is like a video game clam where its like one an a half times as big as you and if you try to stand in its open mouth it will start to shake briefly for like a second before slamming shut instakilling you


snorfling


I definitely thought he was saying he had 120 fish tanks in his office


I am dying over here at the level of reflected awesome displayed in these words. 

I never knew that I required the words snorfling and gigantic fucking clam to be used in the same sentence to feel satisfied with my life, but there it is, and here I am wondering how he ever escaped such a place to document it for posterity.


Last time I was staring down a giant clam while two people were nibbling my toes I I was in Vegas…

I adopted a roborovski dwarf hamster a little bit ago.  Robos are several things - theyre fucking tiny, they're fucking adorable and they have no fucking interest in being handled.  I was at a pet store getting something for my cats when I saw her and I was struck with existential dread.

I had small pets when I was a child.  I did my best but I didn't know what I was doing.  And at least I tried my best, I have heard so many stories about pets who have died from neglect or accident or cruelty and I could clearly see this tiny adorable things life - she was born in a breeder bin for the specific purpose of being a pet for a child that will in no way understand how to care for her and also may become frustrated or angry when she refuses to play with her like a cartoon.

So I bought her.  And a 40 gallon tank.  And yards of tubes.  

What I learned right away is that she is the cutest thing that has ever existed, she's this tiny little ball with the exact coloration of an English garden hedgehog.  Everything she does is so fucking cute and - and this is the twist - she has no idea.  Nobody has ever informed her that she's impossibly fucking adorable and she does not understand the concept. 

To her, everything is *deadly serious.*  she's constantly wary and approaches all situations with the severity and iron will of an ancient bear.  There is no play in her.  There is no fucking around. 

So I built her a home.  I set up a modest labyrinth of tubes that I buried under the bedding with multiple ways in and out, and I put the entrances near everywhere she might want to be - her wheel, her water, her food, so if she ever felt even the slightest bit worried she could dart down into tube city and be safe.  

I set her up a nest under a wooden arch that I buried in bedding and set up a tube to get to it.  It's her favorite spot.  It's up against the glass so I can see her but it's surrounded by solid so she can feel safe.  


She's wary of me because I'm huge and clumsy and I make a lot of noise, but she has come to accept that my presence means treats.  She will never allow me to pet her but she will let me watch her do stuff.  (But I gotta follow the rules.  She has two speeds - 'cautiously creeping' and 'literally capable of teleportation' so if I do anything she doesn't like she blips out of existence.)

So that's our relationship.  I bought her specifically to save her from an uncertain existence and I've given her a gigantic home filled with things to keep her occupied and places she can run and feel safe.  And in return, she lets me watch her from a distance.

I think that's kind of what you were talking about.  

Her name is Mishka.  Bc she a tiny tiny bear.

Bro Im at the end of a COVID infection, I was drifting in and out one night in a fever while I couldn't sleep, and some of the shit I was half dreaming half thinking was so fucking crazy I wish I could have written it down, and I can confidently say even my half lucid fever dreams weren't any weirder than this shit.


I mean a eel Patrick Haris is exactly who I would expect to write this.


did the exact same thing


happy cakeday may you find blessed bivalves in your future !! :3 !!


I thought it was gonna turn into a misunderstanding where the OP meant military tanks and the store guy meant aquariums (and that it would be a shitpost)


Now I want a clam


[I found this link to a 120 gallon aquarium tank.](https://www.customaquariums.com/product/120-gallon-glass-aquarium/) So the clam is big enough to take up half the space.


[This video](https://youtu.be/Cbsay97RzqY?si=jHJziymUI4fddJv5) from Smithsonian National Zoo shows giant clams around that size near the beginning.


The scene opens with OP pushing through 2 salloon doors strutting in and putting her hands on her hips and looking around. She wears a cowboy hat, and open toed high heels which inexplicably have jingling spurs attached to them somehow.

"I'm here ta seeya man abouda *Spits with perfect accuracy into a nearby spitoon* claaaam."


Didnt you read? That clam is his baby.


It gave me an image of high heels,  but made like sandals and Im not sure how to feel about it. Also, why does the owner have TWO dogs with a foot fetish.


Maybe sandals? Idk why you'd call them that though.


Eh, not enough classical music


Clam cam on hand


considering how big it would be to take up almost half a 120 gallon tank (which another commenter provided the estimate size), I think it would be like that to at least like a cat


There are two kinds of specialty stores, he found the good one

god are you there?

it’s me clam


at the peak of my bout of COVID i had a dream that started cool but when I woke up I straight up cried from relief. I think i was aware of the fact that it was a dream but couldn’t wake myself up and that really got to me.


like you didn't want one before all of this...


I want the rest of the movie.


Maybe the Warsaw municipal water system will lend you one of theirs.


So about 2 foot long? Or 1 foot, depending on the dimension.

The Pacific giant clam is 4 according to Google and that's the largest, so that's a pretty impressive clam.


Could it not be a 120 litre tank?


Almost all cats and dogs have foot fetishes. That is the nature of the beasts.


My final thought is that maybe they're trying to say heels but with like open toes? [Something like this.](https://i.pinimg.com/432x292/77/70/86/7770867ba9eae421f36da501218a4af8.jpg)

I had only one unfortunate one. I once went to rehab for alcoholism because I was hallucinating, and those are usually really messed up hallucinations, and in one rehab I woke up in a cold sweat not knowing who or where I was in a dark room where all the patients slept, just completely lost. I even said out loud "I don't know where I am" and asked someone for a cigarette (no cigarettes allowed in rehab here so the guy looked at me like you would naturally look at someone disassociating and making no sense).


My COVID dream was the same thing down to a T except I was in my room so I felt like I knew where I was, but I rolled over and my brother was standing over me wearing a dark hood and cape, and in the dream I asked him what was happening and he said, "don't worry, you need to sleep" and his eyes started glowing red. It was just really disturbing. In the dream I rolled back over and woke up in real life in a hot flash under the covers. I didn't remember that dream till just now.


Could be, I don't know much about aquariums tbh


I thought it WAS "*Original* Original Poster"


Bro what the *fuck*


Over here is the idiot corner. Just the three of us so far.


Yeah this bout of COVID for like 18 hours of it I was just tossing and turning alternating between really fucking messed up sleep and laying awake in either a hot flash or cold sweats trying not to think about puking because I didn't want to get out of bed and there wasn't anything in my stomach to throw up anyway. And it fucked with my sense of smell way worse than last time.


I'm definitely getting a booster shot next year.


Ive heard the latest strain sucks, seems like your story supports that! Booster for me too then, damn

Holy fuck is the combat fluid. As a fan of Armored Core since Master of Arena in the 90s I am so hyped for the return of the series.

I can't wait for this


I’ve never played an Armored Core game before. This looks fuckin sick. I love the hit responsiveness.


That bit of music at the end is banging. I hope there's more of that through the game as well as more ambient music here and there.

Action looks great, smooth, and fun. 

I have to say though, why is the lighting so… flat? At first glance it looks almost retro. Looks good in motion, but the lighting engine seems quite out of date, even by Fromsoft standards. 

In any case, graphics aren’t as important as gameplay and it looks like a blast.


The only criticism i have is, the lack of sense of scale as with every other mecha game, its like its just a human size robot. honestly, the only mecha that felt like a giant robot to me is MGS5 Sahelanthropus


As a rough armchair preview it feels:

60% AC third generation
20% AC forth generation
20% souls

And this is good, the mission structure from the older generations are better, more strategic and slower, but they did implement some of the dinamic aspects from the fourth.

Doing so, they improved enemy behavior to be kinda like souls, to make enemies more unique and more possibilities for the gameplay and for mech building.

This is not Mech Souls, but they did implement what learned and what they are good at, gameplay wise, into this game.


For some reason, the gameplay makes me think of Arkham's Knight batmobile battles, but more in-depth and in 3 dimensions. 

Good thing that contrary to most, I liked those battles. Can't wait!

That slapped. That gameplay was pretty much all I needed to see in order to be sold

I'm not going to rush to pre-order it right now or anything, but I don't need to see anything else until the final reviews come out. Unless something goes horribly wrong, I'm down.

The flow of modern fromsoft combat seems to lend itself very well to the armored core formula. The increased focus on melee looks fucking rad


i love this, reminds me so hard of one of my old favourite games Slave Zero from 1999


This game looks so incredibly sick so far. I have a few more Armored Core games to get through before it drops (I've played up to Silent Line), but I'm very hype.

The combat and encounter design does seem to be taking some smart lessons from FromSoft's recent titles (like the more telegraphed attacks and more transparent enemy stagger mechanics), while still maintaining its own identity, and it seems to flow really well. Love the new laser blade animations too.

That ability to actually lock the camera to an enemy is going to be a *huge* change though. Like 90% of the challenge of fighting enemy ACs in the older games is trying to keep them in your FCS lock, so I'm curious to see how they balance out having a real lock on.


I know I'm going to be in the minority here, but I'm not really heartened by the focus on big boss enemies in these previews.  Most Armored Core "boss moments" were more like fights against other ACs/Ravens or traps that imposed some new limitation on you.  Big set piece bosses were rare and really "oh shit" end game moments.  I couldn't get into V, so maybe the game play shift had already started then and I'm just behind the times.


This game is gonna be the shit. Can’t wait to see how From implements their learning from fast paced games like Bloodborne and boss design from Souls games into the Armored Core recipe.


One thing that sticks out to me is that the audio direction is very restrained. They've really struck on a unique balance that seems like it'll be very enveloping during play.


Wow. Now I am more excited. Never played any of the AC games but the presentation here leads me to feel it encorporates the modern FS mechanics and feel. Looks slick.


Looks incredible, they have definitely implemented a more deliberate Souls-like flow to the combat coupled with insane arial mobility. I'm sold.


I dunno, honestly. I love fromsoft games so much but this just does very little for me. Maybe they will prove me wrong because I was a doubter about sekiro and that’s like my favourite of their games but robots moving through big empty looking warehouses just doesn’t capture my imagination. Looks kinda dated visually as well. This might be the first fromsoft game I don’t buy day 1 unless I’m just being an idiot and all the reviews are glowing.

World feels (no pun intended) totally lifeless. Robots doing robot things shooting other robots in a big empty warehouse. I find it hard to believe I’m going to give a crap about any of these machines. Do they even have names or just numbers.


This might be the first mecha game that looks fun to me. Although I was hoping for better graphics. This is the type of game that can really benefit from nice visuals and sounds to sell you better the "feel" of these heavy machines clashing with each other.


I couldn't tell from the UI but it feels like mobility is more costly than old AC games? That is what I am hoping for at least.


Wow looks really good, you can actually see the inspiration they got from Dark Souls with the lock on and telegraphed attacks (last time i played an armored core was 15 years ago so maybe im wrong)


The combat looks phenomenal, but I'm a little underwhelmed by how everything looks. It looks very flat and honestly kinda boring, though I guess that's maybe just because its a dull factory setting that we've seen in a bazillion other games. The lighting just doesnt really look that nice.


Looks really drilling fun! I wanted to type freaking, got auto corrected, and liked the result better.


really good sound design


Gonna be honest, I'm a little disappointed. Combat looks really fun. Graphics are a little underwhelming but there doesn't look like there's much weight behind these mechs. They're massive machines but there's almost no impact when they land after a jump. Feels more like an rc robot.


I haven't bought a AAA game full price for years now, I'm a "wait a year or so for sales and patches" kinda guy but I will 100% buy this game out the door and the more I see about it just reinforces that.

Armored Core is *back* baybeeeeee


As someone who hasn’t played AC before, maybe I’m missing something? Nothing in this video stood out to me as particularly “amazing.” Everyone’s talking about the fluid movement/combat but to me it just looks like lost planet 1 mech combat with a little more effort thrown into it. Also this game does not look visually good at all. Like not even a “FS went for this aesthetic” kind of thing, this game straight up looks like a PS3 game.


-	The lighting (or perhaps texture choices at work?) cast an incredibly flat tone over everything. The player mecha casts no shadow.

-	Mecha still have the classic mech game problem of poor visual scaling vs the rest of the world/environments

-	Gameplay spaces are bland and barren with little environmental storytelling. *Mis en scene* is overall quite poor.

-	Very little “character” to enemy units - just a (very) glorified hit box for your targeting reticle to lock onto.

-	Seeming focus on “boss events” but little in the way of unique or detailed map design for these arenas shown.

The overall package really shows off FromSoft’s well documented weaknesses with technical performance imo. Meanwhile commenters ITT are defending all the above as “intentional design choices” or “part of the AC experience.”

When do we get off the “FromSoft 11-D Chess” dick sucking ride and back to reality? If this was another franchise (or especially another studio) imo the blinders would be off and we’d be calling this gameplay reveal what it is: mid as hell with definite upside potential.


I'm going to assume that the sound feeling muffled is just because of how it was recorded. It's better with the next footage.

An odd gripe I had right off the bat was the smooth movement over the top of the bridge structure; it's more empty than solid, but you can smoothly go across it like it's a brand new road.

Because of how big they made the place, it felt like the mech was pretty small. It doesn't feel grand. Early on in the combat, you get beside cargo containers, so you are actually big. But you feel pretty small. This is especially true for the second footage. You can see walkways meant for people, so you are indeed massive. But you feel like an ant in a vent.

I get it's the theme, but man... the environment leaves a lot to be desired. There is no awe whatsoever; if anything, it feels dated, as if we're back in the old days where all we could render were boring plain factory looking environments.

I'm now sure what to think about this. The combat looks smooth, but nothing else stands out to me.


This looks like one of NieR:Automata's levels. The graphics (muddy brown textures), the colors, the lighting, even the particle effects. Feels like an Automata level on a scale of an entire game.

Definitely a hard pass from me, the demo looks boring af. Not my type of game.


This looks really "meh". Nothing in that video feels like a next-gen game. Graphics are outdated, lighting is just straight up bad, environments are empty, no sense of scale at all, combat is nothing to write home about... Boring environment is really surprising coming from From Soft. Their engine might be outdated, but environments of Souls games always looked great. This whole video was taking place in an iron box.


Not impressed. Gameplay looks like just another variation of any 3rd person game that does dodge rolls, double jumps, and circle strafes. Graphics look fine, but also very simple and flat. There's no scaling here either or sense of size and weight. The mechs could be 18 inches tall or they could be 60 feet tall.

The environments don't look exciting either - oh look, a factory, and another factory, and an indoor industrial area, and a sewer, and another indoor factory.


This and Baldurs Gate 3 are my goty picks (Zelda already won with botw)


I don't know if it's the lighting, but I know what you mean. The environments have a very clean, almost sterile look to them. Think it might be shaders. It doesn't feel natural, almost artificial and plastic.

But in motion, the game is looking extremely smooth. Like what I see so far.


It looks super empty too. These huge facilities, but nothing really just laying about. No drones doing their jobs and moving stuff from here to there. No screaming tiny staff running around. Parked vehicles.... whatever. It feels kind of lifeless and thats disappointing.


I get where you're coming from. It's not that it looks all that bad or that it lacks atmosphere and that there aren't very good looking things related (like the smoke and VFX in general look great and seem to react to light sources even), but there's something missing especially when in shadow. Like you'd expect to see some AO under the Mech's legs, but there's nothing. Sometimes the mech is bright, but the area around is dark (probably baked).

You also have these super bright beam slashes that cast very little light around them.

Maybe it's a concession they had to make for performance and there's no good fix without ray tracing. I do think it might also be partially intentional or at least fits in a brutalist and dystopian kind of way.


Did we watch the same video? The lighting at 10 seconds in immediately stood out to me as looking great. Inside at 1:30 and 2:15 especially look fantastic too. The way your boosters cause highlighting and shadows on your mech as you're boosting around look sick.


To me it looks exactly like an updated Armored Core game, which im sure the hardcore fans will love. The gameplay definitely looks smooth and responsive, and I love being able to heavily customize my mech.

I just wish these games had more character. The boss fight at the end looked very promising, especially when compared to the old games, but nothing else has personality. The environment is barren and lifeless, all the enemy mechs might as well just be target reticles on the screen. There's hardly any character at all, which I guess is why I struggle with FromSoft games in general.

Don't get me wrong, their souls and souls-like games have style, but its all basically the same dry tone with hardly any variation of it at all. Honestly, "dry" is the perfect word I would use to describe their games.


Mean it's a bit grey. The lighting isn't the issue, it's the palette.


Well the game is still targeting last gen so it is literally out of date, most studios seems to have switched focus now...


I get what you're saying. One thing that contributes to the feeling of scale is the movement. Logically a large 3 story robot should be weighty and slow. And they did just that for Armored Core 5. Thing is that game was extremely divisive. It was the slowest (in terms of movement) game in the series even when compared to the old PS2 era games and it fundamentally changed how the game played by a lot. It was exacerbated by the fact that fans just came out of Armored Core 4, the fastest paced games in the series.

I see a lot of compromises in the game which I hope pays off. They made the game responsive and at a good pace. But then you get things like instantly turning to a side from a standstill which really makes you feel like piloting a 3 story high paper-mache model.

Edit: Also just want to add on that there really is no winning in that department when you're making this type of 3rd person action mecha game. You can make it feel weighty and realistic but then the game's pace will suffer and controls will be obtuse and tank like. But making it responsive and snappy will improve the game's feel and pace but then you're ignoring the fact that these are huge mechs who should weight like a Boeing 747.

Of course the obvious solution is to scale the mechs down, but then that's no fun for the power fantasy.


You should check out MechWarrior then. It's the same universe as BattleTech, but the top down strategy doesn't really capture the scale well. Mechs in MechWarrior really pilot more like tanks, to the point where W isn't the "go forward" key, it's the "increase throttle" key and your mech slowly lumbers up to your set speed at whatever it's acceleration is. You also control your legs and torso separately, like a tank body and tank turret. The controls are great, and Piranha Games really nailed the gameplay feel of Mechs I think. 

Unfortunately, MechWarrior Online is really microtransaction heavy, and MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries is a little obtuse on it's gameplay systems outside of mech combat. Mech 5 Mercenaries is probably worth checking out on sale if that description above interests you.


While AC has always been lacking in the scale department like you're saying, some things AC did very well to sell the mech fantasy was the UI and controls. The UI had lots of dials and meters and shit, giving it that "cockpit" sensation. The video is stripped of those elements entirely though - I'm hoping that they're still in there, and that From didn't go for a more functional minimalist UI. The somewhat weird control scheme also helped give the sensation that you were *piloting* a mech instead of *being* a mech, although I doubt that'll survive intact for AC6.


I've had hopes about scale for a while that has turned to disappointment with this trailer.  While it's not as bad as the room-and-hallway missions of previous Armored Core games, there's definitely a lack of details in this supermassive sci-fi complex to indicate that you are, in fact, a giant robot.  Just a few zigzag stairwells, catwalks, train tracks, and shipping containers.  The complex doesn't really look like it's manned and operated by tiny humans with places to work and means to get around.

I particularly can't help but notice how off the flooring seems.  Lots of grating panels that are too big for humans to walk on, and metal ridges that humans would have to climb over, outright insurmountable by common cars.


I think that sense of scale will get better once we have more context. The player mech looks around the same size as the ones in Xenoblade X based on the cockpit. I think the scale feels off because we're in a giant factory setting without any familiar sizes/shapes to compare to. I imagine that once we see some smaller, familiar features around (like Humvees with people or something) we'll have a better feel


I was really expecting a bigger impact sound when landing from big heights, that really felt pretty subpar for FromSoft who are usually amazing at sound design. That's another thing that's making it feel like a plastic robot toy rather than a huge mecha to me.


I see it as 60% Old Gen, 15% 4th Gen, 15% 5th Gen and 5% souls.

With the energy drain and overall speed being similar to 3rd gen, 4th gen's boosters and "primal armor", 5th gen's hangar weapons, kicking and scan mode and, the souls hard lock on and healing. 

Improvements to enemy variety (especially the mini and main bosses) can be chalk up to souls if you want.


Damn, you and I got very different impressions from this gameplay. It looks a lot more "armored souls" than armored core to me, especially after watching the videos from people who got to see the actual demo.

Hard lock on, monster-like bosses with huge telegraphed melee attacks, shields for blocking, stagger bar, melee combos, ~~estus flask~~ repair kits, changing loadout mid-mission...

Its pretty obviously not a straight soulsborne game, very three dimensional and its gonna be mission based, but still. Souls players are gonna feel right at home.


Never played an AC game, have played and liked Dark Souls.

I would be PISSED if this game turned out to be just Dark Souls with Mechs. Elden Ring was actually a pretty big disappointment for me for just being essentially Dark Souls 3.5. 

I really appreciate that this game is not that; but I will say, this looks like a PS3 game.


Yeah, I mean, I'm glad they're making it but it isn't for me. I think this looks a bit like an early PS4 game at best, TBH, if not a remastered PS3 game.

The Souls series gets away with a lot, including pretty janky graphics by modern standards, because the gameplay and design are incredible. This game seems to have worse graphical limitations, and the series is not nearly as beloved. They're going to be fighting an uphill battle to prove that this game is worth it.

EDIT: Jesus Christ, clearly people really disagree with me on this one. Please, if you disagree with one of my points, feel free to reply. I hope I'm wrong but don't think I am. I guess we'll see.


Its quite the opposite for me, i seen alot of AC fans getting mad because this game carter more to soulsborne fan lol.
like getting mad at the lock on mechanic for example, its so dumb man.


There's 2 types of lock-on. Soft-lock and hard-lock.

Soft-locking is old-school FCS, and automatically distributes your attacks between each enemy in your FCS. So if you have a 6 rocket salvo, and you're aiming at 2 enemies, they'll get hit with 3 rockets each.

And Hard lock focuses all your fire on the hard-locked target, which is far better for staggering enemies, or focusing a specific type of ammo on a specific unit.

I honestly really like the idea. It means the challenge integrates into the strategy and knowledge of enemies and their weaknesses, rather than just pure aim. 

Can't wait to see how combat plays out on a longer scale.


Well you gotta remember they aren’t just marketing to die hard Armored Core fans. They’re trying to get people that have never played before to be interested. I’m sure it’s gonna be sick. Feels like forever since I’ve played Armored Core, I think the last one I played was AC4 and that was at least 10 years ago lol


In terms of story and setting, AC has historically had some pretty decent (if minimalist) characterization and antagonists. It's very much in the "depersonalized and faceless future-mercs murdering each other within a corporate dystopian hellscape" field of tropes but they get some pretty decent interpersonal pathos in there.


I celebrate the entire catalogue of Fromsoft games but with you on this, these areas looks barren and flat like a proof of concept. it doesn't seem to have a sense of verisimilitude

  like you'd see in the Star Wars prequels where it's like what do they even make here, jagged metal rods? enemies are just there at one point guarding pools of lava I guess.  at around 1:50 the player is in the last corner of a room that's a dead end with nothing but a flashy battle droid looking thing rolls out and attacks. logistically why is there an expensive and deadly robot tucked away with nothing else going on

I'm sure this is probably just not the best representative of the game and will gladly eat my words when it all clicks for me


>If this was another franchise

Bro is talking like Armored Core is a world-renowned franchise above criticism when there's been plenty of it since the reveal and critics have historically torn the series apart for one reason or the other. I mean your feelings are valid, but I'm not sure what you were expecting; most of this really is par for the course for the franchise. You don't want to hear it, but if it's not for you, it's not for you. You see mid, I see (my) GOTY.


I mean hey alright but there are several different types of environments that weve already seen...

Also idk if you have ever seen a factory or any indistrial facility in real life but they generally arent too colorful...in fact this is very colorful for that type of setting.


Typically the worker bots end up fighting you as your goal is usually to murder everything. In past games you'd go up against cranes and various manufacturing MTs when entering these types of environments. 

If the game is similar to previous games we will also see quite a few levels for variety, stuff from riding a sub on the ocean, deep jungle fights, snowy tundras, dusty deserts, etc. 

So while I get the disappointment it's also not the kind of game where you're walking around regular every day factories - you're literally being deployed to destroy, disable, escort, and defend while navigating these types of areas.

These missions are all about the action, environmental story telling DOES exist but it's never been the focus of the Armored Core games. 

Not trying to excuse them from this stuff just trying to set expectations for what they usually offer with these games. These places are post apocalyptic wastelands being controlled through corporations that don't give a crap about which civilians or property they damage as long as they get their way.


That’s the FromSoftware aesthetic and it also fits the plot:

>	Armored Core VI is set on a distant planet, Rubicon 3. There, humanity found a new energy source which could dramatically increase its technological capabilities, dubbed "Coral". However, this substance instead caused a cataclysmic event known as "The Fires of Ibis", engulfing the planet and the surrounding star system in flames. After its rediscovery a half century later, humanity once again attempts to gain control over this mysterious resource.

This isn’t peak production, everything was set on fire and they are discovering/harnessing Coral again many decades later.


I don’t want that at all. That kind of clutter looks great in screenshots or when just standing and looking. But it makes the combat far less readable when playing a fast mech game, and can increase the challenge of spotting enemies amongst the clutter way too much.

A perfect example of this is The Ascent, it’s a beautiful game with tons of detail both back and foreground, but it absolutely impacts readability, which is hugely important in any action game with multiple and highly mobile potential targets.


Other than some of the nicer particle effects if you told me this was running on PCSX2 upscaled to 4k I'd have believed it. I mean this in a good way, I think more games from larger developers should go this route. Not everything of course, but gee whiz it would be nicer than every game taking 6 years and $400 million to make.


That was my reaction too. Something made me go, "Erm, do I really wanna buy this?"


probably not because at 1:50 the weapons being fired off are not effecting the lighting in the environment at all. Further on at 3 minutes the huge blue explosions are doing nothing to it either, only the enemy's flashlight is effecting the surfaces. There's really just a ton of bloom around the actual abilities themselves.


It’s more the overall image than the details. Environments and models look extremely flat to me unless some kind of particle effect is happening. I feel like they need to up the contrast or something, or just have more exaggerated shadows.


I agree this looks excellent.  *could* be better but I don't want insane cinematic shadows like this is TLoU plus that'd be such a hardware drain look how big that first map is.

Plus they probably went a little "contrast-friendly" for a demo


Can't really agree with your point when it comes to the souls games, they come far above average in creative locations and simply weird and wacky creatures once you leave the starting areas.

That said I have to agree when it comes to this video. I couldn't really tell most of the enemies apart from each other, they're all grey mechanical blobs on a grey background.


[deleted]


I wonder if you could give fast mechs a sense of scale with audio and visuals. Like giving extra emphasis to the massive amounts of air you are pushing around, showing tons of sparks/damage when you are speeding across a surface etc.

Of course, that might get annoying over time if everything is just loud and creating effects constantly. Its a tough problem to solve


Seconding this, and also:

I'm in the MechWarrior 6 waiting room. I don't expect it to come out this year, but hope we get some news at least. As generic as it is: I need my Timber Wolf in modern graphics!!


I actually disagree to some extent, at least for mechwarrior 5. Its a bit too arcadey to really capture the feel of battletech. I understand why, but its too easy to be pinpoint accurate. Things should kick like a mule both to dish out and receive. I should be able to smash a mech to the ground with an Ac20 like I can in tabletop, I should have to lumber to drag my weapons into a tighter group to smash mechs. 

And with MASC you can accelerate basically instantly even on assaults and late game just becomes "Go fast and smash enemy mechs with every pinpoint gun in the CT. Rinse Repeat"


Piranha games didn't nail the feeling, Microsoft did when it made mech warrior 1-4.


Vaati has a video where he goes through what the HUD looked like in the live gameplay he was shown at a press event, including a mock-up of what it roughly looked like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUTPLucLU5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUTPLucLU5I)


Don't forget about the first version, which had all that, built into a custom controller, which featured a manual startup sequence you had to put into the controller.  Iirc the game was like $100 in 2005 because of the controller, which you had to buy with the game.


I mean a lot of things here though are from soulsborne, but a lot of things could simply just be argued to be modernizing an old and kind of janky series. A lot of modern gamers won't put up with a lot of AC's classic weirdness. So fixed lockons, loadout swapping, and the like I feel are more touches to make the game more approachable to modern audiences. [And are generally positive in general IMO]

A few like the style of telegraphing and staggering are soulsy, but seem to be implemented well enough so we'll see!


Nah. It looks like armored core with slightly expanded melee combat and bigger boss battles. It still very much looks like the AC we know and love, with a little bit of lessons learned from all their souls experience.


Yeah I'm in the same boat, I think we'll see a lot of the Souls DNA in it. People still argue about whether Sekiro is a souls game, but you can't deny the impact that FS touch has on it regardless. I also notice moving through levels where you're not flying looked vaguely reminiscent.


Yeah, this is just wrong. The overall response to this game is very positive most places and people are exited. Also, no one cares about graphics as long as the content is good. If people as a whole actually gave a shit, Tears of the Kingdom wouldn't have sold like hotcakes because that game looks like something off the gamecube.


>This game seems to have worse graphical limitations

Try increasing your quality, overcast weather might be messing with your automatic quality settings. The graphics in this game look fantastic, so I'm pretty sure you weren't looking at them at the recommended resolution.


Especially the rivalries that develop between mercs, either in arena or otherwise.

My hope is that pvp is random like dark souls, similar to how in the old games an enemy pilot might pop in at anytime during a mission.


AC is of course an old (previously retired) franchise. But it’s also a FromSoft product and online in 2023 that buys a shit ton of cover for things that would be less excused in say a Mechwarrior entry.

Armored Core 5 came out on PS3/360, released in 2012. Saying that most of what I mentioned is “par for the course for the franchise” is the exact kind of free pass I’m talking about. FromSoft products get mythologized so that what were clearly technical/skill limitations become “deliberate design decisions.”

It’s simply not (or shouldn’t be) excusable to say a game looks bland etc. because it’s from a series with a history of blandness. And with respect to the reflexive “defence force” feelings of a lot of gamers, look no further than the un-commented drive by downvotes taking place.


Yeah, but thats because they know its empty because of design/technology limitations and wrote a reason why its like 99% big mech battle, and 1% environment. I get it, but it would be really amazing if it was more immersive.

Then again, I am kind of comparing this game to PS2 Zone of the Enders type games. Im sure its still going to be amazing, and I used to play a ton of MW4 on the MSN Gaming Zone back in the day so ill probably pick it up.


Seems like the caveats of FromSoft games are going to become more obvious to the fanbase with this slight genre shift. Im all for a barren aesthetic, but it can be distracting how lifeless their game worlds feel sometimes. 

Reminds me of the old days when games like PS1 Spider-man had a ridiculous story excuse for why you couldn't see traffic down on the street.


Sounds a bit like the plot from Sonic 06 which had an Iblis trigger and a future where everything went up in flames x)

I guess in the end they both chose the same mythological background but its funny that my first association is Sonic06. Dont think that was intended


The player's mech doesn't appear to cast any shadows.


I think it's mainly the materials that are giving it that look, if they're using a PBR pipeline they're not putting it to good use. The metals have no specularity and lack detail. Also there's very little self shadowing so everything looks very flat. It's not bad looking necessarily but it definitely looks dated even compared to Elden Ring


Yeah I think the main difference here, aside from the art direction, is that you're moving around at often intense speeds and are rarely up close and personal with your enemies. Thats why the only enemy with character is the boss.


I mean, it can't be that way otherwise it wouldn't be fun. A core tenant of first person shooters is that the bullets / lasers have to go where I aim them. Even games like War Thunder or World of Tanks follow this basic principle of "bullet goes where you point".

And having played MWO since closed beta, a lot of tabletop rules just don't translate well to a "shooter". I remember the controversy when "ghost heat" was added (heat ramps up extra fast firing multiple of the same weapon). But I also understand why it's there, because 7 heavy lasers can just 100-0 the torso of most Mechs. Not an issue when you can add hit modifiers to the mix, definitely an issue with the pinpoint accuracy of a mouse and keyboard. Same deal with double AC 20's, really funny when you one shot someone, not very funny when you're getting one-shot. I remember LRMs being an issue too, they had to add a minimum charge distance, and severely reduce the accuracy to make them less un-fun to play against. It isn't fun to just die to artillery and have to sit out the rest of the match.


You may be thinking of Steel Battalion, the Xbox game that shipped with the 200 dollar controller, which approximately 4 people bought.  The original Armored Core was from the mid 90s and was just a game in a jewel case.


Yeah it really looks like an AC game but it's finally getting the backlog of modern Quality of Life improvements this game has long lacked. 

Basically I'm seeing it as finally an AC game with a Souls budget.


Yeah I'm a huge Souls fan and I saw very little here that excited me, which is good because I don't want you AC fans to get your franchise watered down by FromSoft making everything the same. It looks pretty much like the videos I've seen of the old AC games, just shinier.   
  
They've put out so many banger Souls games I'm not gonna hate on them for going back to a different series and keeping the differences. Pretty sure this isn't being directed by Miyazaki anyway, and I'm excited to see what he's cooking in a few years.


> Your opinion is just objectively wrong

> No one cares about graphics

lol.

Objectively, many people care about graphics. People pay thousands of dollars for the absolute top-of-the-line graphics cards.

Tears of the Kingdom looks nice and stylistic. Art style can mitigate graphical limitations, which is why Wind Waker and Okami still look great.


The crux of it is that it's nothing more than a matter of opinion. You think these environments (and the rest of the series' environments) are bland, while I think this is one of the cooler locations I've seen in the series, talk less of how cool I think the mech designs are. It's not a matter of defence, it just appeals to different people. 

I don't really know why Fromsoft fans get singled out for "handwaving" core features of a series. You tell a Disco Elysium fan that it's mid because it's just reading, they'll tell you the same thing. You tell a Kingdom Hearts fan that it's mid because it's too "anime", they'll tell you the same thing. Sometimes it just really isn't for everyone.


Uhhh, it's just always been that way?  This is the 6th (mainline) game in the series, and despite it not being enemy-dense, it's because: 

1. Environments are pretty varied. 
2. The mechs are very customizable. 
3. Even "run of the mill" enemies present a real / present danger since many "regular" attacks lock-on and have little to no telegraph
4. Environments are either fully / partly destructible.
5. Mecha battles are REALLY intense (thinking of Arena modes from 3 / 3-9Breaker
6. Often times the enemy is aware of your presence and either has evacuated or is evacuating to stop you from doing something.

From Soft has plenty of games with lots of enemies / environments with LOTS more assets (ER, BB, etc).  This isn't a technical limitation but a deliberate design choice because it fits in with what players expect of the series.


The problem is in this game, and fast paced games in general, a level of emptiness is necessary with as little visual clutter as possible.

It's a hard issue to solve.

Though yeah in general their barren games do get old, if you play them back to back


Then again this is exactly the same as the previous **18** armored core games before (since that was originally the video game franchise they were known for).

So the actual armored core fan base is probably beyond the moon that they're finally doing another one after all dark the dark soul(-likes).


>	Reminds me of the old days when games like PS1 Spider-man had a ridiculous story excuse for why you couldn’t see traffic down on the street.

The difference is that was a technical limitation whereas this is an artistic decision.

From games are heavily inspired by “wandering warrior” fiction where a lone hero travels great distances through stark, often barren environments. Just because this game has mechs doesn’t mean the environments have to look like an Amazon Fulfillment Center.


> Seems like the caveats of FromSoft games are going to become more obvious to the fanbase with this slight genre shift. Im all for a barren aesthetic, but it can be distracting how lifeless their game worlds feel sometimes. 

Yeah this game looks about as decent as the Soulsborne(ring) games technically but those games relied heavily on the fantastical worlds and art direction to mask that. AC6 is pure utilitarian sci-fi by comparison.


Yeah that’s always been my gripe with FS worlds. They’re static and lifeless, but not in a “the lore explains this” kind of way, but more of a “we literally put all of our eggs in the gameplay/art basket”. I know it’s an unpopular opinion but FS are one of the worst offenders of refusing to innovate and expand on their ideas. Even though I played a ton of it, Elden Ring was a big disappointment for me for essentially just being Dark Souls 3.5.


This one of those things fans of the game won't acknowledge and will keep scrolling past lmao. It's very obvious now that you point it out. Small effects like that can improve an image by a lot. The lighting in this game just doesn't look very modern. People in here are saying this is on purpose for aesthetic and readability but... I dunno... Starting to feel like a lot of gaslighting in this thread.


Yeah, hence why I said I kind of understand why they do it that way but the problem is that makes it so battletech just doesn't translate great to games in general. MWO handles it by basically just being "We are battletech themed" and then completely doing their own thing balance wise.

MW5 really struggles with it because in a singleplayer game the objectively best solution is "Point at center torso and one tap through the core" And it really sucks, MW4 handled it a lot more gracefully because mechs WERE a lot more awkward. Torso twisting had a ton more inertia, dragging your reticle could have some inertia, so it was hard to settle your cursor onto a target and slam the same point on anything that wasn't an assault mech. 

There is absolutely room for a balance where you can have a hard time aiming and be rewarded for precision rather then it just being assumed to be the default. Hell this was even a problem in the Hairbrained Schemes battletech, where precision shot was objectively the best move to do because you could just instantly core people out with an alpha strike. Battletechs model of distributed hitboxes really only works if there is some factor to assist in spreading damage and limiting concentrating it.

Like laser burn times, that was one of the best innovations PGI had in terms of addressing damage spread, but then they make it so its really easy to just hold the burn anyway so it gets undercut.

Edit: Though honestly, I would adore trying a battletech game where you do have more inertia and aiming is handled purely through cones of fire where its "Its somewhere in this cone so the more of this you have on the enemy the better your chances are" But I am a fucking weirdo that loves weird janky shit.


No, subjectively many people care about graphics. The fact is that graphics alone do not correlate to significantly higher sales numbers compared to games with a good style and gameplay. Top selling games are not dominated by cutting edge graphics performance and games that pride themselves in cutting edge performance typically do fairly well at best. 

If anything there is a slight negative connection in that regard, in that often spending huge amounts of resources on chasing graphical perfection will lead to performance issues and mismanaging budget causing gameplay issues. 

By every metric, graphics have a bar that is "Good enough" and pressing beyond that has very diminishing returns in terms of reception and sales, if not actively harming the project. Armored Core, The souls games, Tears of the Kingdom, Baldur's Gate and many many more aim to target that metric, not some absurd photorealistic fanciness.

And sales and response vindicates this, at worse dodgy graphics get a "Well they aren't amazing..." and I cannot remember the last time that a serious review docked points off a game for graphics unless it was actually egregiously bad.

Also I have no clue where you found the "Objectively wrong" comment from.


I’m certainly not trying to say *subjective opinion bad* or *don’t be a fan of anything*. I just think that even by comparing this title to previous entries in the series, when the most recent is 10+ years old, is damning with faint praise.

Tech power aside, a decade of development experience and seeing what competitor studios are doing should’ve been enough for From to aim higher. “Better than our last title” iteration is fine when you’ve got a 3 year turnaround. For me this just isn’t good enough from a look/presentation perspective. Or, let me rephrase, what they’ve shown so far paints that picture - like I said in my original post, there’s definite upside here and I haven’t *played* the game. The experience could be so great I ignore all this, I’m open to that possibility. 

As for your comparisons to other titles/fandoms, I think your examples kind of miss the point. An apt/fair comparison would be telling a Disco Elysium stan that the “narrative complexity” is actually smoke and mirrors and the system underneath is guiding you to one of 5 outcomes. Or that KH is mid because it relies on remixing 4 tile sets across 100 hours of gameplay and uses a punishing checkpointing system to hide asset loads. (As made up examples)

Only a FromSoft-style defender would say something like “the 5 choices are all perfectly considered and the lack of real choice in this narrative-focused game is *actually* a meta-commentary on player agency” instead of “yeah, that parts a bit shit but the rest is 10/10 for me.” 

Kingdom Hearts no longer has a problem with assets and checkpointing - it becomes a “staple of the series to reuse assets, Sora’s journey is intended to be reflected by the limited palettes and the checkpoint placement is designed as a difficulty check.”

There’s always a reason for friction points; limitations are always design intentions; authorial intent trumps the way something is. That’s the FromFan hand waiving I’m talking about; you can head to any of their game’s subs and see it in action. It’s not the end of the world, it’s just a common blind spot people have for these devs; not hard to understand why either, they’ve made some amazing games.


> From games are heavily inspired by “wandering warrior” fiction where a lone hero travels great distances through stark, often barren environments.

I understand that, and honestly that narrative style appeals greatly to me, or at least it did the first couple times I experienced a fromsoft game...

but what once felt like a very purposeful thematic decision is starting to feel more like an excuse for not innovating or improving beyond the narrow confines of their established genre. Even this gameplay trailer, while intriguing, does feel a little too similar to the Armored Core games of old. Im sure for some thats the appeal, but to me it just looks like a relic with very few immersive elements.

**Edit:** Also I would argue what FromSoft does is often worse than what PS1 Spider-man did, because they cant use technical limitations as an excuse. I just think of Bloodborne and how the only "normal civilian" NPCs you could talk to were disembodied voices coming from doors and windows. Like, sure, ok, they're hiding from the plague, but that still feels like a lazy excuse. They could have modeled these characters peaking through cracks in the door, or at least shown their silhouette in the window, but no.

and what do the rest of their NPC's do? They either fight you, or stand around in predetermined locations, sometimes acting as a shopkeeper and rarely doing anything unless it's something that supposedly happens off screen.

Like I said before, eventually the "artistic decision" excuse loses its impact.


> refusing to innovate and expand on their ideas.

I disagree there's anything wrong with this. I like X, I want more X. They make more X. I'm happy. I don't need constant innovation or expansion. I just want more of a thing. There are so many new different experiences out there if I want them. I don't need the things I like being changed away just for the sake of "new" over good.

Novelty is overrated. It should be enough for a thing to be just good.


Heavily agreed. People kept applauding Elden Ring for being such a free open world game in the same vein as Breath of the Wild, but I’m playing Tears of the Kingdom right now and boy does it put Elden Ring in perspective, at least compared to how free it’s open world really was.


> But I am a fucking weirdo that loves weird janky shit.

I mean, you already said you're a Battletech fan. 

Jokes aside, there are a few mods available that really change the feel and damage of the weapons. They still go where you aim, but the enemy AC-20s can do serious damage to you too, so you really need to be more tactical about how you approach the situation.


That's more reasonable. I mostly agree. However, it was a little hard to look at Elden Ring's spiky hair and weird character creator after playing the Bluepoint Demon's Souls remaster. But the game was otherwise incredible, so it didn't matter.

I wouldn't put the souls games in the same camp as Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate, those games look gorgeous. Like Tears, it doesn't need to be photorealistic to be nice to look at, if it's stylistic. Elden Ring looks stylistically good, but the geometry, physics, and hair are looking pretty dated. ACVI comes out 1.5 years later and, to me, doesn't even look as polished as Elden Ring, and unfortunately in a sci-fi tech game, geometry and physics issues are more glaring.

Really primitive geometry; everything looks incredibly blocky. A robot explodes into a bunch of squares. As another poster pointed out, as other games are moving into incredibly sophisticated lighting systems, it seems like your mech often doesn't even have a shadow. I will say, to its credit, that it looks like they're going for crazy draw distances and huge arenas, so that might be the reason for the limitation and stuff not looking so great up close.

If the game is otherwise incredible, and the gameplay loop is as compelling as Elden Ring or Dark Souls, then you're right, it probably won't matter. But if it isn't, it's going to get a metascore of like 6/10 and people will forget about it a month after release.


This whole thing reads like "thing I don't subjective like is objectively lazy development, and anyone who disagrees that they're objectively being lazy because of how I subjective feel is absolutely a toxic fanboy because the way I feel about their development choices based on my preferences is pure fact"

Like or dislike all you want, but calling things "lazy excuses" simply because you disagree with the design is absurdity. Sure it's lost its impact on you, but that's _on you._ That happens when we're exposed to things over time. It's not a flaw in the games, it's just you, but you're putting the flaw on them instead of seeing it's just your opinion.


>Like I said before, eventually the "artistic decision" excuse loses its impact.

Man you really seem to keep missing the point. Its not an "excuse" its a decision that you dont like and thats fine. Their games just arent for you anymore it seems, plenty of people do like this *design decision*...


I’m not wanting some crazy change to the formula, just something new. Sekiro felt new after Dark Souls, but then Elden Ring just felt like going back to the original formula. It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s predictable and made the game fall kind of flat for me. Aside from the copy+paste of the mines/catacombs, it’s things like looking at the same door opening animations for a decade; or being yet another lost soul waking up in a dead world (both the good and bad way) with a female companion that levels us up; and fighting the same enemy types just with different models.

Im glad AC is something different, even if it’s not my cup of tea. I just kinda hope whatever their next game is, it’s something a little more different than the standard souls formula.


God I never understood that stupid comparison to breath of the wild. The entire talking point of BOTW is freedom, and compared to BOTW, Elden Ring is SEVERELY lacking in freedom. Being able to choose where to go is not comparable, that’s like bog standard for an open world. I still love ER/FromSoftware, but this circlejerk has been annoying since Dark Souls 3.


Yeah, I have some custom jank actually that basically takes the spread formula for the LBX and applies it to all guns to varying degrees. Since you have a cone its more about placing shots in general areas. 

Its pretty neat actually, really changes up how you place shots.


I mean of course, that said even FromSoft themselves admit that they aren't necessarily great at doing certain stuff. For example they didn't have living towns for Elden Ring because they didn't feel confident enough to stray away from their usual design principles.


> Its not an "excuse" its a decision

One does not exclude the other. A design decision is an excuse for why the game is not designed a different way.

Im arguing that they can still succeed on the artistic direction and philosophy they're going for while improving on various systems in their games. 

Its frustrating how as soon as a fanbase develops for anything, any argument for change or improvement is just met with "well the games are doing fine, so why don't you fuck off"


The problem is you're looking only at an artistic perspective, and not at all thinking about how that effects gameplay. Visual clutter, in games where you're moving fast and tracking multiple enemies, is the last thing they should be focusing time and energy on. Being unable to pick out enemies you're supposed to attacking and defending yourself from is horrible game design, and artistic direction unfortunately has to take a back seat to that.

Can I get a trans masc version of this meme?


Demo's based, unlike soldier (He has a voiceless where he says Demo "just a Englishman with a dress")


I dinnae know what a gender is, lass! The bloody payload's stopped mivin an we only got 2 minutes lef in the roond! Pyro ain't e'en got a gender and they can still poosh the cart!


This is actually a rough translation into English of what Demo actually said

>"Aadyyuoowaahdid--*BUUUUURRRP* D': EEEUOOONE THEKS AM JUS' *snooore* huh? Wha?"


FREEEEDOOM


Am from Scotland and can confirm if your outside a pub past 9 you’ll more or less have this conversation


Why is demo more supportive than my father?


Too coherent thar demomsn isn't real


I remember browsing traaa in class when I was questioning my gender, and when I got to this image I had a really strong nosebleed


He would 💯💯💯


R/Traafortresstwo is leaking


Thank you Mr.Demoman very cool


I feel seen as a Scottish person when somebody types out a Scottish accent correctly.


Thank you demoman tf2


Yo, who is this anime girl i see everywhere?


\*demo charges into the distance


My own meme being reposted near on 2 years later. I'm so proud.


Damn thats so based


what does semi boymode mean tho?

can you tell me some fun facts about murder drones


GET AM BOYOOOOOOOS

HAAAAAAVE AT THEM LAAAAAADS

LAAAAAAATS DO IIIIIIIIIIIT


i’m gonna do it but who do i put in place of the anime girl?? i cannot fink of our equivalent :C


That is due to his denial of the existence of Scotland, not due to any transphobia


aye man soldier and demo are best friends it's just friendly banter

"Dominated, you one-eyed cross dresser!"


My dude. Soldier is racist, Not transphobic.


Maybe Menhera-kun instead of Menhera-chan, if there are any pictures of him that would fit the meme


You're an eejit.


LAAAAATS DO ITTTTT


Havent you heard? Demo is your father now


I am so sorry I gave you a nosebleed

(I made this meme like 2 years ago)


iirc "boymode" is presenting as a masculine man/boy, so "semi boymode" would be like that but with some feminine elements (but not enough feminine to be "femboymode"?)


I'm guessing it just means dressing as a tomboy, still feminine but not completely


Omg Madeline Celeste!!!¡!!! Omh hiiii :3


> ef ahh wanza man ah waz, ahd kiss ya! *hic*


The plot of each Murder drones Episode is at least vaguely based off of a classic horror film. To name a few, Episode 2 has some inspiration from The Thing, episode 4 from classic slasher films, and episode 5 has some from The Shining

finally, spongebob-genshin collab’s character.


really wish they hadn't changed the voice direction from his very first appearance. at least I think they did, it sounds so different from before. a shame too bc it used to be perfect for his personality imo, now it feels almost too "tropey"


"Ever since I was a kid-" 🤓


Hi, I'm Mika, cartographer for the knights of favonius 🤓🤓🤓


For some reason the voice is giving me more naive version of Weevil from Yu-gi-oh


 > Ever since I was a kid--

Bro didnt grow tho haha


Oh no... He's adorable, but that EN voice is too grating. 

What happened? It wasn't like this on that event a couple of patches ago. It was shy, but it sounded more natural. 

This is like they held the VA at gunpoint:  
 "🔫 I SAID 🤓-er!!"


LOL, poor klee running into jean at the end. She's grounded now for SURE.


But why did I think he was gonna say "kardashian" instead of "cartographer" lmao


bro is the embodiment of 🤓


The first time I actually legitimately hate the EN voice


In CN/JP he calls Klee "senpai."


Oh Christ, can’t stand his English voice.


I’ll be honest, it’s pretty late here.


his music though


looks like the protagonist of an adventure shonen


The gaelic music be slappin hard


I usually don’t mind the English voices even though I play in CN, but, man, this one is pretty damn bad. It’s like they made the voice actor try way, way too hard.


Spoiler:

&#x200B;

Mika is actually Enjou in disguise.  Ha Ha.


What’s up with the mini tail on the back of his head…


Is it just me or does he sounds like a 10-year old and a 70-year old at the same time? 

Just me? 


Never mind then.


Finally, the average Genshin players self insert


Still hate his voice intonation


I changed to the Chinese dub almost immediately after I started playing back in December 2020 and have had no regrets. 

I'm sure Mika's VA is a talented person, but whoever is in charge of the direction made a bad choice imo.

The same can be said for how the English dub handles several other characters, like Paimon. Chinese Paimon sounds cute and mellow, while English Paimon sounds like a shrill unholy abomination.


Waiting for spit to fly from Mikas mouth


That voice certainly is... a choice. Just gonna stay playing in JP over here lmao


So adorable 🥹 that music is a mood. Mond is home.


The voice director went from Disney mouse too this, this is too old cartoon for me.


Someone needs to make an animation of him in the South Park style.


His theme sounds like something that would play on a DnD session to set up the mood.


I dislike the voice they went with but I’m in love with everything else about him


I cannot get over this terrible voice, sme in myh needs a kick in the balls for this

Jp version it'll be then


Why does he sound like a mouth breather? 😭


never thought I'd dislike an EN VA more than I dislike Layla's but here we are


It’s a shame his voice lines would be unbearable to hear often so I will never use him. He has some fun elements to his attacks and seems like a decent utility for my cryo team. But he will be locked in my team purgatory with Dori.


His theme song reminds me fairy tail


Why is voice so goofy 😭


The music is SO GOOD!


☝️🤓


“Erm actually 🤓👆


BABY BOY


Chocobo boi


Y'know, It's not exactly my cup of tea, but not gonna lie, it feels immersive to me.


This is more 🤓🤓🤓 than Tighnari was


Why his voice sound like a Reddit or twitch mod


I think his VA was great for the Weinelesefest - as in it felt pretty natural.  Not sure who wanted the more nasally voice but it doesn't match him.


Everything about him screams that it would look better in a chibi model. Instead, we got an awkward teen.


"ever since I was a kid-"
WAS? lil dude is delusional.


Holy Archons, the comment section really hates VA's voice sound. I guarantee they're gonna attack him on twitter. Sub vs Dub all over again..


Mika really do be sounding like🤓emoji


this video made me realize mika wears earrings


Im beginning to think that gigabytes of jp dub doesn't look to big anymore


Did the VA have a cold when they recorded this? That's the only thing I could focus on.


idk about this voice tho. sounds like the kind of va that ppl will hire to play babies in nickelodeon.

another reason to stay on jp voice language.


Is it me, or does Mika sound like he has a lisps? Anybody else hear it?


🤓


Klee: Goodness, Klee is late for her Daily Genocide. Bye bye Master Jean!


Glad I’m not the only one who’s peeved about the voice change like what was that about.


4* characters having the best themes as usual


That Klee dance always make me laugh


Just checked how his Eng VA looked like and I did not expect it at all lol


That feeling when the 4 star is better than the 5 star of the patch


Stop, I love him so much. I actually really like his EN voice because he looks like he'd squeak back of you made a dent in his skull.


Final Warning🤓🤣


 let him cook i ain’t eating 

this is fire get the estinguisher

and so on


His theme song was pretty fun


first demo where it was hard to sit thru, I do not like the direction they went with.


He's just a cute guy doing his thing and drawing his maps


Celtic music, huh... Is there any lore about Mika that says he's from a different part of Mondstat or something?


Just remembered this masterpiece https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Memepact/comments/11cgk50/akchually_i_use_a_polearm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


🤓


Letz keep goingz team! 🤓


**Klee Casually blowing mountains away**

Mika: Ah shit here we go again
**Redraw the map**


God I hate his voice..


Dude his JP voice feels miles better then his English voice lmao.


As one of the 1% of players that play with the English dub



What the fuck


I can't believe I get to play as the 🤓 emoji, truly one of the characters in genshin ever.


Dude sounds like Spongebob


Lmao fuckin nerd


His voice lmao


MY SONNNNNN PLEASE COME HOME SOON


Small fact

Klee is Mika's senior. In JP version, Mika called Klee as Klee-senpai. AFAIK, CN and KR also have Mika refer to Klee as his senior, I don't know why EN cut that line off


Yeah, no way in hell am I pulling for him, his voice is annoying as hell.


[Kyle's cousin Kyle?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MJSpgSnX24)


i really don’t like him but im vibing with the music lowkey


Klee is terraforming Monstadt with her l bombs so he must change his maps, lol

all those happy little craters.


…gotta get used to the voice i guess

well other than that, i probably have to wait to get him off standard, idk who he might get a rate up w/ after this


As a c6 Eula haver this voice makes me sad. Ugh.


That theme ... Oh how I love medieval songs !


Yeesh his voice sucks


He reminds of Butters awwww the way he talks, how silly he looks very determined and hard working i love how he fights! he learned from the best people fr cant wait to pull for him

Ik 4 stars are not guaranted but i will try


Ah yes, out living nerd emoji is HERE 🤓


Oh god I hate it. I will stick to the CN voice over.


I hate this voice


I really love his voice :(


he’s truly so adorable


His voice makes me want to skip


No free Mika ?? 🫠


Level 100 when?


So I'm not crazy and his voice is different! He didn't sound like this in the wine festival. Weird choice... I'll throw 30 pulls on Shenhe for him. If I get him great, if not, it's pity. lol


Why does everyone bully him bro I feel bad for his VA. Alhough, I do wish his voice direction was a little different as well. I still want the boy because he's adorable and this is a banger ost

Real question, do characters like Sucrose get this kind of hate too? Do people hate socially anxious nerds that much?

Edit: Ok yeah, pretty sure the main problem is his voice direction and I see why. He sounded a lot cuter in the weinlesefest event :(


The voice is starting to grow on me. His design is kinda ehh though but I love his use of multiple weapons. I'll probably get a shit ton of cons for him but I don't really have a use for him.


This comment section.. yikes.. y'all acting it's the characters fault.. blame Hoyo for direction! I personally don't mind his voice.. can't wait for y'all to go on Twitter insulting the VA like y'all usually do 🙄 

Ps. I'm pretty sure the nerdy, Lisp like voice was entirely the point!


My baby boy 😭 my 60+ wishes are all for you (and Shenhe if she comes home)


He will become the most forgettable genshin character in a few months calling it now


I love his voice, he sounds so good and fun! Maybe you'll come home one day, Mika.

ETA. And the music is banger!


Good thing i'm a JP enjoyer.


God that english voice is awful.


The voice has a feeling to wanna be Sora.
And klee is the character where she has more appearance in others demo.


Didnt know we have a south park collab now lmao


they rly put tails in genshin


Is that... Eric cartman?


so him using polearm, bow or catalyst?


When the character is 🤓



But the music is🔥🔥🎻🪈🔥🔥


Oh I’ll have to mute him


He sounds like a DBZ abridged character


God i hate the voice, It was okay at first but they changed It to sound... Weird, like the typical Nerd with braces that cant pronounce certain words well, like i bet he says akchually like that


this voice... he is on weed


🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓


He sounds like he gets pushed into lockers on the daily. I hate it a lot


Yeah, i hate his voice lol

Have the strong urge to shove him into a locker


Eh voice is very much not my thing. If he's good I might consider him for my Eula team but nothing about his design actually excites me. A tall slim cartography nerd wearing baggy clothes and really ugly boots 🤣


What the fuck is that voice


Wtf is this Ben Shapiro sounding Chocobo looking ass talking about "when I was a kid"


No offense but who’s actually excited for this character? I mean realistically are you actually going to be using this chocobo looking dude 2 months later when the next new shiny character drops.


All these custom weapons are fun and all, but please, please please. Dont give them melee weapons and make them have ranged weapon as custom, then use that ranged weapon in melee. That's blasphemy.


Why does he sound like cyclops from Mobile Legends lmao


🤓


The voice is revolting lol 🤢


Some of yall are so insufferable. Voice sounds fine, sure its different from his initial appearance but its not some terrible atrocity some of you fuckin nerds think it is lmao.


MIKA MY BABY BOYYY im going to crown him he is perfect


🤓


god his voice is just the fucking worst


HOLY SHIT THEY ADDED 🤓TO GENSHIN


MiHoYo needs to just. Uproot the voice localisation team for English. They miss every single time.


Actually, can I ask why character demos are posted here moments after they've already been officially released? It's not considered a leak anymore, right?


Didn't expect to see this today.


Sounds like Hiccup in HTTYD1


i reminds me of venti trailer and yelan at the end because of rain hmm


Steve Smith is that you?


Let's go team!: all alone


Now i gotta listen to nails on chalkboard to calm down


Adorable character, really awesome (useless) NA animations, kit that still doesn’t make sense for our actual physical unit(s).


Oh jeez... That voice...

What did they do to my boy


I hate en voice so much💀 its so annoying why did they make his character sound like that😭✋🏽✋🏽


I'm so sorry I love Mika but he sounds like the nerd from that boyfriends webtoon


Another voice that doesn't match the character.


Am I insane or are these characters getting LESS appealing over time...

&#x200B;

YAWN.


Oh my god that voice makes me want to throw up. How do people play this game in english?


🤓


I still love him but, the voice sounds like it’ll get annoying eventually


he sounds like the nerd emoji


What a sad character :-( all hype for this man died the moment we learned he uses a polearm. 😭😭😭 What wasted potential


literally the 🤓 voice


Yikes


He sounds like a nerdy Bryce Papenbrook whyyyyyy


His sound 💀, it is like a looney tunes character.

His old voice was much better.


babygirl


He went from nervous speech impediment to turbo-nerd.


I really wonder what the thought process was behind the change. His original voice sounded nervous but fairly normal overall. It was good. Now he sounds like he’s being forced to do a South Park voice at gunpoint. It’s like how Baizhu went from fairly normal to a fruit stall owner between appearances.


Yeah, same with Layla. The voices aren’t even bad, it’s just that the direction is so odd and tropey, as you said. Very “anime-ish” and not in a good way.


It reminds me a bit of Baizhu. I remember back in 1.1 he sounded pretty normal and calm in English. But then it came the second Lantern Rite, I think? And suddenly he, 🏳️‍🌈 lmao


Ngl I had the same feeling. For both him and Bennet during the windblume event.

May I ask if there are some confirmation about it? They both sounded a bit different! O.o


Is there any clip on his first appearance voice?


[deleted]


They've been doing this for a while (look at the original Barbs vs what we got now), they probably have some research pointing to tropey character designs just selling better in the mainstream market which is sadly the target audience


Yeah, I really hate the new direction.


His original voice was so cute


Im just so glad Im playing in JP


Damn he grew up fast.

Guess it comes with the territory since he has to keep updating his maps after Klee bombs another Mountain and/or Lake 💀


He sounds like a younger version of [Mort from Family Guy](https://youtu.be/CajZJoQllDg?t=10)

Edit: mixed up with South Park

Holy shit his voice really is 🤓 incarnate lmao


Lmaoo


Thinking about it idk if I'm remembering the abridged version or the English dub but I suppose the answer is just yes.


It's a silly line because the lore says he was a small child 2 years ago lol


Sayu moment


I never even liked his lines to start with, the constant pauses and “uh”s just makes me die a little each time he speaks. But the fact that they somehow made him worse is amazing to me.


Couple of patches ago?

I thought of the same

It's weird too because I actually liked it in his first appearance. Now however, he sounds a alot more...nasally? Like did something happen with his voice direction or have I been mandela effected into thinking his voice was different?


Same. I'm generally really positive when it comes to EN voices but man Mika sounds so bad. It didn't seem this bad back in his first appearance though but maybe I'm just misremembering.


They really recorded this and went “Yeap. Sounds perfect”


THIS DUDE POPS UP AS AN AD ON YOUTUBE WHILE IM DRIVING LISTENING TO MUSIC AND I HAVE TO RESIST THE URGE TO DRIVE INTO A DITCH EVERY TIME


Lol same. It sounds like those anime kids doing gestures on tt


Another L from the Eng Dub imo

From Xiao's ooc performance to this, it's pretty evident Itto's casting was pure luck and the Eng Dub director sucks at their work


Xiao*


Its ok


Me with Nahida, I can set aside my gripes with every single english voice, but Nahida actually being casted to sound like a fucking toddler was where I drew the line. It is an actual disservice to the character.


Probably out of respect?.. But yeah idk ☠️ She is an elf.. but hey. 

Maybe he is ranked lower in the Knights of Favonius than Klee, who was literally out to survey (?) the area with Amber and Eula during the recent Windblume?


Embarrassing bro...


It's ok, Mika's still way earlier than his Squad Captain 💀


1:48am for me


Such a charming classic fantasy tune.


Need more Celtic music in the game.


His theme is really amazing. Too bad the same can't be said for his EN voice..


Honestly more of the protagonist's friend kinda deal. A little bit like Zenitsu maybe?


He's gonna get Isekai'ed into the abyss ?


Seems to be the pattern for Monstadt boys.

Bennett? Unlucky shonen protagonist

Razor? Raised-in-the-wild Shonen protagonist

According to the rule of three, there must be a third one. Mika's it :v. Surprised he isn't an orphan (as well) though


"M-m-m-master Jean, I j-just accidentally sold Mondstat to t-the Abyss order"

"W-was that against the r-rules?"


Mihoyo design team couldn't contain themselves


Ahoge goin' crazy. I'm just going to pretend it's the anime version of 🤓, even though that's not really it.


No bro, i feel that too ┬⁠─⁠─⁠┬ﾉ⁠(⁠°⁠ ⁠-⁠°⁠ﾉ⁠)


Nah, this dude is good at something


Nah that's Layla.

Schizophrenic insomniac.


They hate Mika's english voice because it reminds them of them


Aside from my own personal preference of playing games in their original language, Chinese Paimon is the main reason I enjoy the Chinese audio over all the others. She sounds adorable in it. So I don’t share the common sentiment of hatred towards her like so many others.


Chinese Paimon seriously does not get enough attention. Both JP and EN went with the shrill high pitch for some reason. I know EN started out closer to CN, but over time it just became more and more like JP Paimon. KR Paimon isn't that bad either, but still not as nice as CN. It's the only dub where I can listen to Paimon for long periods of time without my ears feeling like bleeding, which actually makes me more interested in her when listening in CN.


i agree, they did the same with Layla, it’s like they’re trying to make them sound way too anime-ish but fail miserably. Honestly I would’ve preferred they sounded older, even if it didn’t fit that much with their appearance or age.


I think CN Paimon is probably the most “canon” interpretation, if you will. She sounds childish but not overly brattish like EN and JP, and sometimes sounds thoughtful, as if she’s more than she’s letting on. CN Paimon has that “I am hiding secrets from you” vibe whereas EN and JP for me just sounds like another chibi mascot character.


I'll be honest, as someone who is somewhat fluent in Mandarin, I personally consider the CN dub and EN dub to be about equal level in terms of quality. CN dub does some voices better, but so does the EN dub.


Same, it might be because I know very little about Chinese, but even npcs sound good to me in Chinese


Fr. It's so bothersome. Like he bit off part of his tongue.


He definitely spits when he talks. Everyone stand back


Unless you're pulling him, I doubt we'll be seeing him enough outside of Windblume for it to warrant a change if you like the EN dub otherwise lol


Perfect😂


It's weird because, setting aside that the VA is a disgusting person, I actually liked the EN direction for Tighnari? He has a nasal voice, but not obnoxiously so, and it sounds mostly natural so it characterizes Tighnari rather than caricaturize him. Mika sounds like a caricature.

Tighnari's CN voice is a lot more straightforward, though. I'm looking forward to Tighnari's voice getting replaced in EN to see if they go a more CN route.


For real. They could've just used the little girl model. Literally no difference between small kids genders anyway


Sure, because Genshin has male chibi models.


True true, especially sucks because I think he sounds actually okay during his attack lines. Not as tropey, I guess? Unfortunately though, Mika just talking (which is like 90% of the demo) is.. I agree, hard to listen to.


Some ppl will always take their dislike to ridiculous level, unfortunately, but what can you do? Fortunately, most will just resort to muting him or switching to another language if they hate it so much. I have no problem with the voice but would gladly welcome an option to switch character voices on an individual level or at least mute like in some VNs.


Do it! Give in to your anger!


Ngl, Korean is probably the most well rounded. It's very underrated.

CN is also good but not everyone is a fan of the way it's spoken.

Nontheless, all languages will have their hits and misses.


Mentioning babies and the JP dub right after is really ironic,considering most anime girls sound like they're 12,that includes genshin


He's pronouncing the S sound pretty clearly imo.  I think the stereotypical 🤓 voice just gives off that impression.


No. Dehya is  justgetting all the attention but Mika also has ALOT of problems in his kit.


We could fight, or we could be like

Dehya combat enjoyers 🤝 Physical DPS Mika mains 

Hoyo didn't give either of us the kits we wanted, but we'll still make the most of the characters on our own terms anyway.


Are you sure about that? A dedicated phys support that is at most a bennet sidegrade at c6 for physical teams? Idk if that makes him worse than dehya or not, but he's most certainly not even much better


Honestly what is the deal with Mika & Dehya?

Dehya is screwed by her kit, it is so bad that Hoyo CS department is about to scream from rooftops.

Mika is screwed by the banner, seriously what he will do with Ayaka&Shenhe?

People are saving primos for Dendro powerhouses in 3.6 and only Cyro lovers will push this banner. And Mika doesnt work with any of them. 

Let pretty boy hangout with Eula and please Hoyo for the love of holy summon her already. I wont pull for her but still ...


1% is an understatement


Don’t do SpongeBob like that…


LMAO


Did you forget when EN actually used honorifics? It's pretty cursed and doesn't really belong in a translation


In most Eng Dub/Subs they usually cut honorifics and all that stuff instead of looking for an alternative for some reason

Maybe because most honorifics don't get translated (-san, -kun, -chan, etc)


Bruh, they did my boy dirty


It doesn’t seem like people are hating on him to me? At least not here. That train passed around the time he was first revealed. Now, he actually seems quite popular for his cute design. It’s just that his voice direction appears to have changed, and it’s very… ehhhh. Sucrose has a great VA who actually sounds like she could be a real person. Mika sounds like a cartoon character.

It’s not the voice, it’s the direction. He sounded fine in the event he debuted in.


Don't see anyone hating on the VA, just on the voice director for requesting that change in acting


The problem isn't the personality or the character, he just sounds really bad. It was *another* bad decision from the Eng Dub director


It's just because his voice changed since his [first appearance](https://youtu.be/ObreRLjfI9E) and I think most ppl liked that one more.


His character type isn’t the problem. He just sounds terrible


I think he's cute and I like his voice too. 
He's just a little guy. Just a little birdie boy. 

Besides, there's a fun contrast between his awkwardness and him pulling out a crossbow.


Nervous girl = Cute

Nervous boy = Not cute

Yeah okay I see how it is :/

Every single character has a community of dedicated players, I've been using Razor since release and still do and will continue to use him, same goes for Mika.  

Also I will point out that opinions vary a lot between regions, so you'd be surprised how much better received he is in JP for example.


I'm C6ing him and have been waiting months for him. There is a dedicated subreddit of people excited for him.


>Voice sounds fine  
  
Lol no, sorry but his voice is awful & it's not about shitting on the VA or EN dub as I play almost exclusively on EN and can tell they mostly do an amazing job.  
  
If anything it seems like you're the one being unnecessarily triggered by people's valid criticisms.


This section is full of weebs which ironically they CAN'T speak Japanese...lol


Really love him but he sounds way more nasally than before. I'm probably going to be playing him on JP dub which I don't usually do


In this subreddit, official info are considered 'confirmation', so that people know which previous leak is really legit.

Also people can discuss leak related info here as well, that are usually cannot discussed in the official reddit post


It was accepted to post official posts here if they're stuff like characters introductions, demos, drip marketing, banners, etc.

Practically anything that is related to what was a leak before


Yes, they are. They’re all quiet, insecure and needy. And from a gameplay standpoint none can approach the power of the OG 1.0s.


Some people both enjoy the English dub and the fact that they can understand what's being said.


Because there are some great performances too. 

Zhongli, Itto, Yae, Raiden, Yanfei, Dain, Dottore, Cyno, Albedo, Scaramouche, Venti, Kazuha, Alhaitham, Beidou, Dehya, Eula, Hu Tao (so long as she refrains from rapping), Rosaria, Heizou, Yelan, Kaveh, Nahida etc etc.

Most are hits. Some are mids. Only a small amount are complete misses. 

You can prefer one dub over another. But the EN voice acting is consistently very well done. This isn't anime in the 90s anymore.


Because I like the english dub


People want to be able to actually understand what is being said. Besides, the majority of VA performances are good.


Because the game has great voice acting. Let's not forget the voice actors like Khoi Dao and Zach Aguilar who have make their mark on the community.


Yea his voice is literally this "🤓"


Loved his voice before, kinda hate it in this


I wasn't a fan of how much he stuttered when we first met him, but I agree his tone was much better before.


I think he only spoke like that because he was mostly reading off of Varka's letter.


Fruit stall owner BAHAHA, I'm sorry but I thought the same thing when I heard him again after the Archon Quest. Dude went from a figure with mysterious allure to Mr Garrison.


Baizhu always sounded like Roswaal to me


Isn't the nerd voice he now has found more in Western Animation than Anime?


What changed about Layla?


[removed]


I feel the same way about Kaeya. He sounds so good in his original hang-out from 1.0. Natural and actually friendly but still witty, playful, and clever. But after that they have changed his acting direction it seems and now it's way too over-the-top and tropey for my taste. :(


Layla fell into the same trap that Sayu’s did. Tired people don’t sound like they’re yawning 24/7 - it just makes them sound like melodramatic zombies. 
There’s a lot of nuance you can add to a campy portrayal and I feel like a lot of the EN VAs aren’t being given the space to flex that subtlety


I thought I remembered his voice wrong, LMAO. He did sound very sassy.


Didn't notice any change in CN. I'm glad, his voice is fine the way it is.

Just listened to the new EN voice and it sounds so comical, how can anyone listen to it without laughing


To me, I like the fruity Baizhu and that's the only reason why I'm pulling 100%. Sadly, during the recent Lantern Rite, he sounds less flamboyant than before and it made me a bit sad.


🏳️‍🌈 is never a bad thing.


Baizhu’s voice changed in his second appearance (the Serenitea Pot quest). Interestingly, Shitou’s voice also changed and became fruitier in that same quest. The latter is because his original voice actor passed away. Makes me wonder if Baizhu and Shitou had the same original VA, but I’m not familiar enough with his work to be able to say.


Lmao right. He sounds way too effeminate and the crop top doesn’t help.


I compared using [this](https://youtu.be/ObreRLjfI9E) video


Just change the va language 4Head


Oh this is just weakness, I personally love Fischl's and Xinyan's voices but hate Xiao's and Wanderer's


uhhh akshually thats family guy


The younger version of Mort is Neil Goldman, his son, and you're right, they really sound the same


He sounds just as dorky and lame as sucrose lol


both perfect


Somebody called it a Ben Shapiro voice, and I’ve never been able to emotionally recover.


I've wanted to draw maps since I was kid 🤓 but Klee's experiments have made me have to redraw some of my maps 🤓🤓
Lmao he's cute tho


I can just hear him reminding the teacher to give out homework for the weekend.


OP probably meant English dub.

Abridged version is Beavis from Beavis and Butthead


that is how tweens are though haha


Mika was in the mondstadt event in 3.1, sounded a lot better than whatever this is. Not the va's fault though, problem lies with the direction they got.

I always forget how cursed, criminally insane, and weird those "Queens of-" subreddits are


You're right.  I went back and checked the scene where he read Varka's letter aloud during his first appearance.  His voice has definitely changed to be more nasally.  I actually quite liked his voice before, it's too much now.


It’s not just you, I think he sounded fine back then too


I wish they gave him a normal voice without the “acting”. even if he looks childish, it would fit the maturity of his occupation lmao.


[You weren't kidding](https://youtu.be/MivdYqW3LqM?t=99).  That's a big difference.


🤓 in voice form


It wasn't. It was shy, but it sounded more natural. This is like they held the VA at gunpoint "🔫 I SAID 🤓-er!!"


He sounded kind of stuttering and squeaky, but I don’t remember it being this nasally?? Like, a little bit, but not *this* much.

I still love the EN dub the most, so I’ll just have to get used to it, lol.


Agree on this


He didn't sound like this back then. Seems like there's a change in the voice direction


Wtf if anyone who doesn’t play Genshin hears this guy talk in the ads they’re gonna avoid the game hard. Mfers buying ads to drive away customers 💀

Although this won’t be the first shitty ad they made, remember that [SSniperwolf ad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Memepact/comments/nl6blg/ngl_sniperwolf_genshin_ads_is_kinda_cringe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

Or this [masterpiece?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/s29knu/guys_im_legitimately_embarrassed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) damn I’m getting second hand cringembarrassment from the actors…


There are a few misses like Mika’s and Layla’s voice direction, Paimon’s increased pitchiness, and Xiao’s harshness (that’s been toned down recently), but there’s also Kaeya, Diluc, Fischl, Albedo, Zhongli, Hu Tao, Yelan, Thoma, Ayato, Kazuha, Raiden/Ei, Miko, Scaramouche, Cyno, Candace, Dehya, and Dainsleif, among *many* others, who are absolutely perfect for their roles.

The EN VA director has a lot of issues (namely with inconsistent pronunciations), but casting generally isn’t one of them.


Remember happy Barbara? I still blame the English dub director for that *unecessary* change.


I dunno.. in part because all of the Sumeru VAs for En know multiple languages (and most of them know SWANA languages) the pronounciation is probably the best for the En VAs vs the other dubs IMO

The direction that their personalities went in was also good too

Now there's some translation aspects I disliked from Sumeru (not even going to touch the Tighnari VA issue which is no one else's in the cast fault but his), but overall I think the Sumeru VAs performance was even more successful overall compared to the other regions. 

It's totally fine to prefer other dubs, but do you not think that the direction has been overall improving? (Esp late Inazuma, aka Ayato+Itto to now) Just curious!


Out of the entire cast there are “two” misses (I’m not counting Xiao because he sounds fine), and that means the person sucks at their job? Gtfoh with this hyperbole.


Non eng dub player here, what happened with xiaos dub?


Pretty sure a majority of en sumeru vas were praised by their performance but jp dub elist will say anything to demean the english dub.


Here comes the “Eng Dub bad, JP perfection” parade. Right on schedule 🥱


Agree to disagree! I actually like Nahida’s EN voice. She sounds like the matured kid she is.


Wait, is Klee an *actual* knight? I thought they just told her that to be able to keep her under control (like her having to request time off so she doesn’t just head out and wreak havoc). Ngl, if she’s considered an actual knight, the Knights of Favonius lose a lot of respect from me for unironically admitting a child terrorist into their ranks. 😬


Here Senpai is used as a term of respect given to those who have more experience. 

So we can deduce that mika actually joined later than klee and that makes klee his senpai. 

In honkai, adam gets called senpai while being 16/17 from an 18+ girl.


Nah, that's the korean webtoon protagonist, Childe's spiel.


This guy also Touches Grass


Hey we gacha players are pretty good at complaining at everything and bankrupting ourselves too ya know


Nah i don't have another hard working persona (bbd💀 or whatever spirit is possessing her ...) Imagine passing effortlessly couldn't be me


I *adore* Chinese Paimon. Can’t stand JP Paimon, and EN Paimon grates on me with her pitchiness (OG EN Paimon was fantastic). Never heard KN Paimon because I deleted all the languages but EN to save space and nobody ever talks about/posts clips of KN voices. 😔


I don't know Mandarin so one benefit of the Chinese dub, to me, is that I don't really notice even if a particular character's performance isn't great. I'm more critical of the English dub precisely because I understand the language--I can identify when a particular character has bad delivery or characterization that sounds off, or just a weird voice like what has been done to Mika.

And it may also be because listening to the Chinese or Korean dub is my first time hearing voice actors from those countries. The English and Japanese dubs are more likely to get on my nerves since there are a lot of VAs I recognize, and have heard in a ton of different roles in the past.


As someone who is fully fluent in both, you’re smoking the good shit. Chinese dub is the best.


They said “stay” I think they already mainly play with the JP dub


Thank god his kit seems useless to me so I won’t have to hear his 🤓 voice all the time.


Yea ignoring the VA I love Tighnari’s voice. I was just thinking how people were reacting when we first heard him


The "Gah, it's so hot... Even a Mist Flower would melt in this heat... Ah, now that I think about it, it wouldn't..." line cracked me up the first time I heard it. I liked the VA direction for EN.Tighnari but still support changing it of course.


I feel like simply because of the existence of anime, JP will always feel the most natural to me for any media with that artstyle.

Idt there's acc been a character I dislike the voice of in JP yet. Some of them sound mundane like Thoma (but still perfectly fine), and then you get absolute gems like Hu Tao and Dori.


yeah you would know


>Mika also has ALOT of problems in his kit.

Mika problem is Rosaria, he is a mere sidegrade to her before C6 though he perfectly functional at C0. Dehya problem is herself, that's the point  


Also a huge problem come from Eula having anti-synergy with Mika, especially when Mika buff is onfield locked


Mika is bad but not surprising nowadays since he's a 4★

Dehya is between the worst characters in the game and she's a 5★, so ofc she's worse lol


I think arguments can be made about how good or bad Mika is, but he's definitely not as bad as Dehya. The fact that he heals already makes him better than Dehya.


Phys DPS Mika main here, I just really wanted to try to make a goofy team with characters that aren't built the way they're supposed to but still work kinda well

Edit: maybe they won't work at all but it's gonna be a goofy team nonetheless


As someone who pulled for Dehya and has Mika's Physical build ready, I approve... We make do...


He's not even just dedicated physical support, he's a healer with atk spd buffs.


Nah don't get OP wrong. Mika is indeed pretty bad (and I say it as a Mika main), it's just that Dehya is horrendous so he's still better


Honestly if they don't wanna keep them then it's best they got rid of them altogether. I remember the English dub of this one anime where 2 dudes were friends for 20 years and they made one call the other "sir" because someone tried to adapt "-sama". 💀

After Genshin's "sworn brother" fiasco I imagine Cyno calling Lisa "big sister" or Yaoyao doing so to her martial sibling Xiangling like they do in CN dub would make dumbfucks think everyone in the game is blood related.


Well-put, Sucrose and Collei doesn’t evoke a strong sense of 🤓 to people, despite also being very socially awkward and introverted. In fact Collei’s lines from the new event is so good it makes me feel relatable to her and want to befriend her. Mika here just sounds painful because it sounds like he’s being held at gun point 24/7 when he talks.


Oh people hate him asdasdj


It's not a matter of boy vs girl. It's that they made him sound like a South Park character.


>Nervous girl = Cute

>Nervous boy = Not cute

Tbf this one is clearly self explanatory. Dudes who think Sucrose is cute like her because waifu and all that shit. Of course Mika isn't the kind of character they like, he isn't a girl lol

After little girls, short young boys tend to be the less popular group of characters in the community since very few people simp for them


After Dehya stole her title of worst character in the game, we've got a three-way tug-o-war between her, XQ's friend, and this guy for most forgettable. Amusingly they're all cryo.


Hope your pulls will go better than Tectone's Thoma pulls way back when. :D


Genshin try not to be a whiny bitch about everything simulator, level: impossible


Criticism toward En dub= Weeb lol


This is the English voice, not Japanese


Ohhhh, no wonder. Alright, thanks!


MR GARRISON I CANT


The point is for many people including myself, the charm point of Genshin's EN dub is that it sounds a lot more natural compared to other dubs. Not every girl has to sound cutesy and not every kid squeaky. Yet with Mika theyre steering into the "more anime, less natural" direction.


Nothing. They were saying she fell into being too “tropey”


Lmao


I hate how shonen it sounds, but I dislike shonen so I'm biased


We don't use that word here.


100% fruity baizhu's, part of a complete liyue. Enjoy with a side of cocogoat milk and make sure you get the qiqi found for free in every bubu pharmacy.


Makes me wonder how he'll sound upon release. I never really noticed if his voice was consistent or not.


says itto diluc ayato


He got the Barbara treatment


Oh wow i forgot about those, and yeahhh what the hell, i like the old one way better! More natural compared to this one.


It was SO much better before. Whyd they do this…


Holy shit he sounds different

Wanderer? Rare to see someone who dislikes his voice tbh


Lol got them mixed up


But he’s not 🥺 anymore just 🤓


No, you can’t do this to me…

Oh wait it’s only Mika, eh, whatever.


I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

Oh no! He got Layla-ed 😬😬


that second ad was actually hilarious💀💀


>Or this masterpiece? damn I’m getting second hand cringembarrassment from the actors…

I have never seen that ad before, and now I wish I had never clicked it. That's so bad LOL!!!


idk if it's just me but I think nowadays kaeyas voice sounds so breathy it looks like bro has asthma


You didn't limit your list but I want to give a special shout out for Mona because I LOVE her voice direction.


Nahida's is really good too, the best VA for imitating a childish voice imo.


Laylas voice at the trailer was a bit annoying but when we met her at the Fungi event I kinda like it. I feel like it got better with time.


Now 🤓 here sounds like he's talking while "holding" his nose and I don't think I can get used to that.


> Kaeya, Diluc, Fischl, Albedo, Zhongli, Hu Tao, Yelan, Thoma, Ayato, Kazuha, Raiden/Ei, Miko, Scaramouche, Cyno, Candace, Dehya, and Dainsleif,

The One and Oni Arataki Itto deserves a mention


Yeah, the ENG dub gets a lot of shit that’s not warranted in more cases than not imho. I’d say the only ones I actually dislike are Xinyan, Layla, and Mika. Xiao and Razor took some getting used to as well but they’re not terrible. For the most part the characters are very well cast.


Ayato???? He's completely mischaracterised in the EN dub. In no language does he sound snobby, just in EN.


They explained away the pronunciation issues. It comes from MHY that they allow the differences because it’s supposed to give a sense of dialect. 

Doesn’t sound great to me, but that’s their reasoning.


Definitely a lot of good voices, but I literally pulled for Kokomi so I would never have to hear Barb talk. 😅


It's a pretty glaring issue when multiple characters have obvious voice direction problems in EN because no other language has this conundrum on such a scale.


was playing the Windblume event with Eng dubbed because I was too lazy to read subtitles. I found most English voices pretty good but damn… Klee’s tho. It was so obvious an older woman is voicing her and the pitch was so annoying.


Please. EN Diluc sounds flatter than Kaeya’s ass, Ayato sounds like a forty-five year old man in the midst of his mid-life crisis (similarly to Dain, but at least with Dain it kinda makes sense), and characters like Thoma, Hu Tao, Ei and Miko are a *significant* downgrade from their CN and JP counterparts.

I won’t go as far as saying it’s the casting that’s the problem, because these VA may very well be able to give good performances, but I fully blame the direction they’re given. It’s generally a tonal miss, with a few standouts (Zhongli, Scara, Cyno, Childe, off the top of my head).

Keep the downvotes coming. CN>>>JP>>>>>>>>>EN, everyone playing in EN is automatically losing. 🤡


If I'm remembering what her VA said back then, it was due to a request from Hoyoverse so the English direction would better match the cadence of the other languages?

Which I guess makes sense- there's different vibes for characters across the dubs, but the Mond characters (especially the starter/free ones) are very consistent!


I still miss my old Barbara :( 

bring her idol energy back you monsters!


It's funny that you mention Sumeru's pronunciation and Tighnari cause his name's pronunciation in English bothers me so much lol Considering the Arabic pronunciation isn't that hard to do I wish they did that instead of Tie-nari


>Esp late Inazuma, aka Ayato+Itto to now

Actually another example with bad dub work happened with Ayato. Ayato's "About Itto" line had a pretty bad direction that made Ayato sound as if he was annoyed and uncomfortable with Itto, which we all know is not the case. It was fixed in 3.3 (or was it 3.2?)


What does SWANA mean?


The thing is is Jp dub elitist love to demonized the English dub when it mades even the slightest voice acting direction mistake all while they praised the voice direction mistake the Jp dub make and praised it as a master piece and a creative take


Xiao does not sound like an angry edgelord in Chinese.


Kinsen (CN VA) said he wanted Xiao to sound cold and distant. EN Xiao sounds very aggressive and constantly in pain amongst other things. IMO the og EN Xiao lines need to be redone to be more calm bc the entire EN fandom thinks Xiao is only every edgy, i'd take a quick listen if you want bc they truly are ooc


The End Dub actress makes him sound angry and edgy in all his dialogues (it was toned down a little this last Lantern Rite) which doesn't fit his character at all


The voice is so bad in English I’ll never be able to take xiao seriously and like his character. Even if I were to switch to a different language my opinion can’t change. Eng made him such a edge lord it’s off


She is an actual knight, but I don't think she has any specific job.  She holds the title of Spark Knight and that's pretty much it, so I think it's just so Jean can better control her.


and has a job


For me, watching the Chinese dub made me appreciate the ENG VAs more, because I stopped holding VAs in another language to a higher, almost mythical standard. I've also started noticing that the Chinese dub has a lot of things that the ENG dub is also criticized for, such as having similar sounding VAs.


Oh, I misread. My bad. In that case, I doubt they would've liked his voice regardless lol


Yeah thay line is fantastically delivered. It's a sad situation all around. Fuck that guy though.


I originally wanted to use JP when I started but EN Zhongli (who also never leaves my team) was so good that I kept using EN all the way to today.


Hahaha that was a good one.


other dedicated element buffers are also 4\*.. Sara, Gorou, Faruzan.

Mika is the worst of all of them.. Mika doesnt help the Physical Main dps like Eula much.. compared to how Sara hugely helps Raiden, Gorou empowers Itto, and Faruzan boost Wanderer and Xiao.

Mika support to Eula barely competes with Bennet who is not a dedicated phyiscal support.


I think you'll have fun, I've had some decent results with physical Shenhe, my only problem with that is as a Eula main since the day she released it's hard to be satisfied with physical NAs on anyone who isn't meant for it :)

I'm currently running onfield Candace with support Dehya, which is more fun than I expcted.


I'm a girl but I hate his voice. It's not about him being a nervous nerd. The voice direction just sounds really uncomfortable to listen to.


That's like the opposite of me lol. 

I hate Sucrose. She is the only character I hate in Genshin. I can't stand her. Don't even get me started because I could rant for hours about my intense hatred of Sucrose. Her existence brings me pure rage everytime I see her on screen (jk, but only a little lol)

Bur Mika? I love Mika. I would protect him with my life. He's just a little guy. He's a baby boy. I'm really excited for him. I'm incredibly sad that I don't want Shenhe or Ayaka because he's the first 4* I've been genuinely excited for in a long time


Tbf everytime I think of Xingqiu I automatically remember Chongyun too lol


How ironic that this applies to your first comment as well.  
  
I can't talk about others but at least for me I'm just acknowledging the flaws in his voice, I wouldn't call that whining


CN voice is pretty natural too, much less over the top. JP voice is the most anime sounding, but that's because all the anime fans use it so it appeals to them.


I've watched plenty of anime, no voice has sounded like this lol. It's much more common in western cartoons.


What, really?

I've always thought the voices were extremely anime. 

This didn't make me go "oh they made him more of an anime trope" I went "oh they made him a different anime trope."


idk, as a cn speaker the cn voices are really good, not much to complain about.

ie compared 7 year old mika here or screechy paimon


I remember a lot of people were saying his voice was annoying etc so maybe that’s why

Wish they hadn’t changed though


Go the Tekken route and have everyone interact with their regional native language and still retain perfect comprehension.


his voice is a bit too... Idk how to describe it, but it sounds very "tryhard" imo.


You don't think people in florida will just sell their houses and move when they go underwater?


Good bot


Take a bullet for ya, babe! ❤️


Good bot


layla and now mika, the only en voices i actually hate so much


What happened with her VO?


Yeah, it’s kind of adorable. Reminds me of those early 90s Nintendo commercials. So cute.


FINALLY someone noticed it, I knew he sounded different in the archon quest for some reason


>bro has asthma

he just like me fr


Mona’s voice made me fall in love with her. I just adore her pretentious accent. <3


Nahida’s VA does for childish voices what Venti’s VA does for women doing boys’ voices. They both sound so natural and smooth.


For some reason I can't stand Nahida's voices...


He was mentioned in the above comment, so I left him out, but yes, of course!


I think Xinyan voice actor did a fantastic job in 2.8 event, I don't get the hate


Its so weird that everytime english dub sounds different, the fandom lost their shit but is completely fine with the japanese dub doing the same to characters like Yanfei, Tignari, and Candace.


They redid some of his voicelines dw, his voiceline about Itto is calmer now in EN :D


He doesn’t sound snobby to me? He sounds like a subtle trickster hiding under a veneer of formality.


I'll respect your opinion, but the last part of this comment...kinda stupid.


Average genshin voiceover elitist


Tbh this is the one situation where I don't understand the community. imo Barbara's old voice was both horrendous and didn't match the CN for Barbara, nor did it give off a nun or idol vibe. The change was a good thing


It's still weird of them to execute the change but then abandon the concept for future characters anyway.


Oh definitely! Them using Tigh-nari/Tie-nari vs the actual Tagh-nari is odd (and especially noticeable since Al-Haitham voice actor uses the proper pronounciation for that sound in other words so you know the VAs can pull it off... plus the VA actually *can* speak Arabic)

I believe it's another instance of "making the Canon pronounciation inaccurate to make it consistent across all the dub" type situation which has already happened a few times in this game. And is definitely an industry thing across other simultaneously dubbed media. (Kaeya being "Gaia" only in the Japan dub is one of the most noticeable situations where they *didn't* do that). 

We'll probably see it a lot in the future for all the dubs, but especially the Cn/Kr/Jn dubs since there's a lot of French/English/Welsh (Fontaine) words that are hard to pronounce coming up, let alone some West African/Spanish/First Nation languages (Natlan) and to a lesser degree Slavic languages (Shneznaya) though I bet for the latter the Korean team will do well. The En team at least seems to be making more of an effort in casting VAs who speak languages from the real life region the Teyvat locations are inspired from which is a nice bonus?

I think both the Eng VAs for Diluc and Ayato addressed it, but apparently all 4 dubs basically record at the same time. This means the non Chinese dubs have to work off the Cn director's direction (and not the voice recordings), as a reference. With many of the Chinese VAs having swamped schedules (noticeable with Hu Tao for instance), the other VAs dub team might not even hear the Chinese recordings until a point they can't even re-record pre-patch launch.

Simultaneously dubbing always runs into lots of problems, especially for the languages most different from the source since it's subject to mistranslation more heavily

I am pretty glad the En team was even able to aquire the budget to fix those lines you mentioned too!

Don't get me wrong, I *do not* think the English dub is perfect by any means (honestly I don't think any of the dubs has been 100% perfect across every region), but I do think they're improving, and I think especially the English voice teams casting decisions will benefit the performance for the future regions over all! 

---

**TL;DR:** The English team has *definitely* had some problems, but overall they've made good decisions with the resources they had available. They've also been improving over time, including their recent casting choices for authenticity, which will likely shine even more moving forward with regions involving languages many of the top VAs the other dub teams like to hire likely haven't spoken much! It's totally cool if you prefer the other performances though! Nor can I blame you if you chose the other dubs due to the problems the English one has had either


i just dont understand how people see Tighnari and read it as Tie-nari. i dont even speak Arabic but my sister and i absolutely refuse to say that.


Southwest Asia and North Africa


I play in chinese and these responses are really explaining why en fandom takes on xiao have always puzzled me lol


And then there's matsuoka who is basically did the same thing as cn except "he is distant and cold BUT acts like a chihuahua around zhongli"  the gap moe 😭


I see! I play in chinese so that explains why en fandom keeps calling him super edgy,  i was chalking it up to maybe en fandom just prefers that kind of interpretation. I might have to go give an en trailer a quick listen!


what? I mean maybe its a bit overdoing it, but bro hes an adepti who was (presumed) forced to commit atrocities, lost all his close friends, and lives every day of his life fighting evil creatures to the death... But nah, he really should cheer up a bit


And has ambition


lol true


I remember liking Ayaka around 2.4 (I joined in 2.3) and wanted to get her, and nowadays I just feel "ok" about her, but since Mika is in her banner I'll try to get her in a 50/50 and see if I can fulfill my 2.4-self dream

And if I don't get her who cares lmao I get the guaranteed for Nahida and still did enough pulls to at leat get C0 Mika... I hope


What flaws are in his voice? Is it too hard for you to understand him or is he too quiet? These are valid criticisms, not, he sounds nerdy and that ruins my immersion. But you know what, complain all you want about a free game that you have no control or influence on, god forbid the developers chose a voice that triggered yall.


Well, that and good/popular voice actors in Japan are celebrities, so bringing a well-known name into your game/show/movie is the same as having an A-list actor in America. It sells.


it's more annoying now tho 💀


I wish this was an option so so bad


He is a tryhard.

At least Layla doesn't sound like a fucking 🤓


barbara can fall under this category too 🥲


I didn't mind her voice in the trailers but in game they *reaaally* leaned into the sleepy voice to the point of absurdity. I liked the character at first but ended up skipping most her dialogue cause it was annoying as hell.

Mika's voice direction I always disliked but now it's actually painful.


Her voice kind of reminds me of that mid Atlantic accent from classic movies. I love it!


People just don’t like her accent. But Idk I grew up watching Sandy Cheeks on Spongebob so I’m used to it lmao.


I think there's just a general distaste for the sort of anime voice direction where they go "Okay, so this Chinese character has an *accent*... well, guess my only option is *Southern*."

That's a highly specific accent to most Americans, so it would be kind of like another language's dub giving a British character a Japanese accent because "hey, an accent's an accent, right?" (I don't know, I'm just playing mad libs with nationalities here. You get it.)


prob because most of the fandom ur seeing are english speaking and dont know japanese so all they hear is anime and cant tell the difference. whereas in english they could


It's only this one as far as I know. His general attitude is still the same and different from other versions. He still comes off as a snobby asshole while in other versions he's more playful and serene.


As are people who massively downvote others for opinions that doesn’t align with theirs. It is what it is.


i and i think many others liked that it was super bright and vibrant and very different for a change. barbara’s whole thing is a little plain and boring so her voice was a nice touch to add some flavour. At least that’s prolly what most of us thought.


I just preferred scratchy overly energetic Barbara to current Barb. She sounded more like an idol with her old voice imo. Not that its stopped me from using her I just like the old voice more.


EN is generally accurate to CN. What do you mean abandon it for future characters?


> Oh definitely! Them using Tigh-nari/Tie-nari vs the actual Tagh-nari is odd (and especially noticeable since Al-Haitham voice actor uses the proper pronounciation for that sound in other words so you know the VAs can pull it off... plus the VA actually can speak Arabic)
> 
> 

According to the (now deleted) stream with Zach and Tighnari's former VA, the pronounciation was a request by Mihoyo.


I mean if you want an answer, it's because in English a lot of words that have "igh" sound like that.

It's pretty common.  I think a lot of Americans would look at Tighnari and pronounce it "Tie-nari" if that's all they were given.


If you are curious:

[Xiao's voicelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wsaqmAw4gY)


Go listen to JP, CN and KR Xiao and you'll see the problem with EN Xiao


And has skills


yeah that's true lmfao


I see! I actually haven’t gotten to much of sumeru or any Layla content so I only know her from the voice lines, since I use her for shields. I totally agree her sleepy voice is over the top and there’s a bit too much of an “I’m a sleepy baby” thing going on lol.


It doesn’t even take someone to be able to understand the language to judge the ton. I’m quite a seiyu nerd and I don’t even understand Japanese except for the most common anime phases, but that doesn’t mean I can’t judge a voice acting direction. My biggest gripe with the Jp dub is how they tend to make adult characters like Ei and Candance sound cutesy and end up doing the opposite to Yanfei.


Ahem. The last part of your comment. Fully deserving of a downvote.


Yep I really liked Barb's old voice.  It was super happy and to the point where her voice got a little scratchy, which was nice.  at least it was unique.  Now she just sounds depressed.


Yup, this. After reading the other person's comment and staring at the name I still can't guess at another way to pronounce it, as an English only speaker and writer.


Yeah, they're a little edgy too. EN is over the top, but the idea that Xiao isn't edgy is something anti-EN dub people repeat often but isn't even true


Xiao is edgy in every language. His EN is just a bit harsher. There's nothing wrong with a difference in direction between dubs if it works, it's not the VAs job to just copy the original performance. EN and JP Yae Miko both sound very different from the Chinese but you don't see anyone complaining about that because it works, same with EN Zhongli, Raiden, and Nahida. Similarly Xiao's EN direction works with his character, it's fine to prefer the other dubs but it doesn't make his EN voice bad.


[deleted]


Yes, the last part that was an edit after I got -30 in ten minutes after voicing a simple opinion. You’re literally repeating yourself, what’s the point?


Ain't no way you just listening to kinsen voice and decided that xiao is edgy


i thought i was going crazy when people swear to me up and down that the other languages have xiao with little to no edge but i dont hear it??


Don't forget about Yanfei's jp voice, almost no one complains about it, heck I got downvoted to oblivion once when I said it's a voice misdirection.

Edit: See what I mean


Yep her first appearance was during the fungi pokemon event. Don't worry she is going to show up in the near future.


Good to know! She’s probably sticking on my team and I’d love to have a reason to like her besides her fun animations.

That’s cool and all but they’re left pretty vulnerable when flying, no? 

Can get easily shot down and can’t shoot back while flying


Jetpacks are fucking cool, idc what you say


I'm a shitty dove hunter, but that I could hit.


nice one, if the enemy is not shooting at you that is...


The military are going to have to come up with a new name for the airforce - because these are the new flyboys.


If they are showing us this can you imagine what they have that they are not showing us.


Anyone else wonder what could go wrong if they tanked it? I can't imagine itd be easy/quick to get out of all that kit in a hurry.


Tony Stark still did it better


Maybe i dont see it, but you could literally fight them with a single broom stick preventing them from landing.

Most commenters guzzle too much action movies to realise you’d have a squad and a warship backing you up when you fly this thing


It works till they crank the boat and take tf off. They ain't gunna out run a boat right?


This looks so cool and sci-fi, I love it.


Until someone puts a shot into that jet pack lol.


How are they preventing jet pack users from getting bopped out the sky on approach?


Imagine trying to move a couple tons of cocaine across international waters and Ironman shows up with War Machine and shuts the party down.


What stops us from making a jetpack-quidditch league now?


For those who missed it. There’s a helmet steered gun on their shoulder which is inactive in this demo. They aren’t left completely defenseless


*waterproof jet pack batteries sold separately

- Mattel


This is the way!


This is the Way!


We didn't see them coming! Or hear the jet engines! Or hear them loudly land on our boat deck! Or see them take anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds to draw their weapons! Completely caught off guard!


Looks like they toggled no clip


They fly now?!


Easier than shooting ducks in KS


Except for the entire flight they’re just skeet to anyone on the boat with a gun.


Well, it's over boys, pigs can fly....


This is the way.


"Shoot the guy flying" bold strategy but I'd honestly bet the US Military planned for that in all of their billions of spending and planning. This is multi-million dollar technology, I honestly doubt some redneck on a boat with a hunting rifle is gonna take these guys out of the sky if they're flying towards you in fill armor with a shoulder mounted, helmet aimed suppression system.


Something more compact with a mounted small arms gun guided with a visor on the helmet with triggers in the gloves with small boosters to keep position when firing and I’m sold


Rocketman


Ive seen this level in Duck Hunt.


Ah yes Search and Rescue becomes Search and Siezure, coming soon Search and Destroy. Cue the naysaysers....


Once they land I wanted to see the jet pack the bad guys in the face. Arms can turn onto some sick ass weapons


This is the way


The amount of sillyness in these comments is epic

1) learn how boarding works. These guys are flying Into a demo not a battle. That's why the helmet aimed suppression system is turned off. If this was real there'd be a bunch of guys actively using suppressing fire, or at the ready to do so. They'd also be strafing everybody themselves using their integrated system. Nobody shoots these guys down when 2k rounds a minute are flying at you from an auto cannon.

2) Again DEMO as proof of concept. Nobody is saying this is a finished product. They are literally testing this to improve it's capabilities. Yelling how it won't work while it's in development is the height of idiocy and shows you didn't actually learn anything about the tech, just offered an absolutely incorrect hypothesis based on assumptions.

3) Your precious tax money is safe, no need to get your fee-fees all enraged. This is a private company called Gravity Industries, and it's run by a former British military specialist who has poured millions into it's r&d. He then workshops the prototypes with various armies and search/rescue teams to perfect it for their specific needs. It is not a product with a defense contract at this point. *That's the entire point of testing it first, to save tax money pre-contract*.

4) It can use weapons in flight by integrating a helmet steered suppression system (gun) which they state *if you bothering to watch the video* they have turned off. Nobody is suggesting somebody trying to fly and shoot a gun when their arms are being used to steer. Nobody is suggesting they fly into combat without mounted suppression ability when needed. *Again. This is a demo.*

5) Of course it can be shot down, like any other light aircraft or drone.... Just as soon as the 20mm cannon on the ship they launch from stops blowing your arms off. People talk like this demo operates in a vacuum and there's only two guys on an op. Learn how the military works and the tech works before complaining with non-issues or worse, with issues they're literally testing to figure out solutions for. 

6) No they aren't useless. Outside a combat scenarios they're turning a 90 minute alpine rescue response into a 5 minute rescue response and already saving lives. That alone proves value of concept. Just because you can't imagine a use doesn't mean there aren't any. They're amazing because they're able to cover short distances incredibly quickly in virtually any first-responder situation.

7) All of this info is readily available to anybody able to use Google to look it up. Gravity Industries


That’s cool, I live about 5 miles from where this was filmed


I hate it when the military tests cool ass shit like 30 min from my house and I have no clue about it


When you realize you are living in call of duty advanced warfare lol


Baby steps.


I dont wanna hear about impracticality in the comments or money going into the military, from the five year old portion of my brain, this is objectively awesome


"You're not landing before you present me the warrant"


People keep talking about the vulnerability of these things, but who gives a fuck? They're God damn jetpacks, that's the coolest shit ever


20 years see this in an airshow, like 10 of them in formation flying across the sky
 badass 🤤 lol


We just watched two dudes fully geared out in military gear seamlessly use FUCKING JETPACKS and these mutberfuckers be like : 
"SeE hIm WoBBLe whEn He laNdS! GARbAGE!"

The fuck does it take to impress you people?


Wayyyy tooo soft a target to approach from a distance like that no cover


Very cool, James Bond and all that, but I agree, they would be dead before engaging their rifles.


I'll wait for the stealth mode.


"Shouldn't we like shoot at them? It's sure taking them a while to get to us"

"No, no, let's let them have this one. It looks like they need it"


The way you said that made it seam like they were going to have a fake seizure mid air


I imagine the next add-on they get will be a small shoulder-mounted gun that the soldier will operate with his head and/or eyes. Otherwise their loud and defenseless entrance will be rather difficult.


hold on... don't shoot...


Pirates are going to start carrying hunting shotguns with 3.5” goose loads


What if the target has guns, and they shoot back?


Pirate 1 : you hear that?

Pirate 2 : Oh the coast guard is approaching in their slow noisy jetpacks, shall we shoot then down?

Pirate 3 : Nah we'll wait until they're landed and have sloppily switched to their weapons.


I don’t understand why a drone with the person suspended below wouldn’t be 1000% safer and more practical. Beyond being incredibly physically taxing the jet pack pilot is completely vulnerable.


So... the terrorist smugglers are required to wait 30 seconds while they unhook the propulsion units and get their rifles ready.

What could possibly go wrong?


I like the part where the boat very realistically sits still and waits to be boarded.


This would be great for the Coast Guard Search and Rescue. Idk if this would be good in a shooter situation.


Whats wrong with a helicopter and some rope


another day of successfully wasting your taxes


these jetpacks need a weapons mount with eye-tracked minigun… or laser. yeah laser!


Show me a sitting duck. Far to vulnerable to incoming small arms fire.


Good thing no one started shooting while flying to the boat.


Looks super cool but not very practical for real usage yet, at least if the target boat has angry people with guns. You're a free target while flying and even after landing you are unarmed for quite some time.


They have no means of defending themselves while in the air. That's extremely dangerous in real life interventions.


So we have these instead of healthcare, cool.


Cool but unless silent what's the point....


Useless as hell, just wait for them to go down to the boat, then push them and throw to the sea, good luck swimming with all that attached


Insanely loud and clunky. Could easily start shooting at them before they arrive since you'd hear them a mile away. Also, their ability to land and grab their firearm is an insanely slow process. These aren't going to be used in the battlefield any time soon.


This is the way


I love it when the bad guys just watch in awe while I swoop in on a jet pack and take them at gun point. Good thing they never shoot back during that part when I'm approaching them completely exposed and defenseless.


So what's to prevent the bad guys on their ship from just blasting them to bits with machine guns as they approach?


I'd love to hear how the gun nuts plan on taking this tech down with semi auto AR15s lol.


What happens if they hit the water? Do they float?


While everyone is saying this and that about vulnerability. THEY FRIGGIN FLEW WITH JETPACKS OUT TO A BOAT.

YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH OF A TACTICAL ADVANTAGE THIS IS!?!?!?!?!?!?! 

The jetpacks will get smaller with time.

If I had to guess, they would incorporate a quick release, just like the I.O.TV.s so they can just get it off asap


Looks like minority report


their hands aren't free to shoot, it needs an auto cannon rifle similar to the Apache setup, where the pilot looks it aims.


What lovely floating targets. Big fleshy balloons coming this way, whatever shall we do?

Yes I saw that they have "suppressive capability." Which will surely do fine against the ten Somalian pirates firing automatic rifles at you from several concealed places of cover on the ship.


That's absolutely useless.


Looks like they need some auto pilot assistance or maybe a landing sequence that allows them to have their weapons out whilst moving towards the target because they are most mobile in the air due to the amount of weight this adds to the soldiers gear and are not capable of defending themselves, now I could see this being very useful if the jet pack team is covered securely by others on boats or helicopters but this design is very impractical, loads of weight onto the already heavy load out, unable to fire whilst using the jet pack and landing seems to be incredibly slow on top of the cost to produce and train soldiers to use it. Compared to a speed boat with a ladder and a cover team. I would also opt for a quick detach system that way once they hit the ground they can sort of park it to remove all the extra weight.


What a horrific waste of taxpayer money that could have never been collected in the first place, or could have gone to education etc.


People worried about safety haven't seen how effective a couple of small drones can be as force multipliers in this situation

-edit- to clarify, sending drones ahead of the flyers would be incredibly effective


it would be so easy to just shoot them. gotta figure the people on any boat that is being raided have guns.


So interesting when fascism steals all the wealth in the wealthiest country.


Hold up before shooting me, I have to take my jet pack arm things off before taking out my gun to aim at you. Doesn't sound too practical to me.


A good shot with a rifle and those boys are in the drink for good.


This is the way.


This is the Way


Like shooting ducks in the sky. Their arms are occupied with flying. This will never work.


Military spending go **BRRRRRRRR**


Eazy to shoot down if you ask me.


Veteran here checking in to add my two cents while new tech is awesome to have.  The US Military really needs to get back to basics.   I have heard of stories about lack of discipline and disobedience of orders.   This is not the military I was a part of 1984-2004


Timeout guys I need to get my gun out! Alright game on!!!


The only issue I see is if the people on the boat were armed they could just pick these guys off as they flew over. It didn’t look like the soldiers had any way to engage while airborne. Also do those things float, because if you crash into the water that would suck.


I don’t know how shocking this can be with loud jets for hands, the element of surprise is blown and they have to land to pull out any weapon.


Kinda lame not having any hands free in flight


All good until you get shot down.or you have a faulty system. But cool AF


So they are shooting turkey practice while flying, and the target happens to have no guns? Nice scenario.

I mean the jetpacks are great and all, but for years that I see these military demonstrations, I can't help but think that the pilots are truly helpless while flying with their arms fully engaged directing those thrusters. So either the thrusting needs to become automatic to free the hands to operate a rifle, or have some automatic defense of the pilot while he is in the air.


Honestly, my first thought is this should be on r/facepalm…


Yeah the two cartel guys are just gonna wait for the military guys to pull their weapons out


What happens if the crew has weapons? Are they going to wait for them to get the exo skelleton off first???


Lol merked before they even land, beauty flying targets. What a dumb concept.


They need a gun on their shoulder like the predator XD. They are vulnerable till they land.


Hilariously bad and inoperable in the field at this level of development. 0 control 0 authority 0 defence 

Nowhere near operational use.


Pirates be playing duck hunter


So what preventing anyone from shooting them down?


This is ridiculous. How much did this cost taxpayers?


Fun and cool, but sadly, slow and cumbersome. 

The military will say the same and this will never make it to active duty in its current form.

Also the heat these give off probably turns you into an active target for heatseeking missiles. That's gonna be a no for me dawg.


Tech is cool but not practical!


Wake me up when they can do it with their arms free and they can fit through doors.


How fun would it be to shoot at them while they're coming in.


Only if all targets have nice landing pads.


Cool cool, can we get universal Healthcare in the US instead of this now?

Edit: it seems they're brits, with the VA location figure US would be involved. Still want the healthcare though.


That's dumb.🙄🥱


Coool, but if I can shoot them before they land what’s the point?


So we're assuming the drug dealers don't have guns or drive away right?


Looks like fun in theory, until some drug runners start shooting at you, or they hide below deck and you can't fit through the hatch


And how many hundreds of millions of dollars did they waste on this stupid fuckin project?


This seems useful for the coastguard, but against militarily capable vessels, they're basically ducks in a bird shoot.


Captain just needs to gun it out to sea. Eventually, they’ll panic that they run out of fuel and can’t return.


Too slow, too noisy. Once they land too heavy to manoeuvre and cumbersome to switch to weapons. I think this is limited to search and rescue but that depends on how much flight time you can get with one full tank.


So nice of the bad guys to not shoot at them during their flight and just allowing them to peacefully land first. VERRRY realistic…


Just like that video of the dude disarming those guards. The sheer reality of it is dude on that boat would Plink the right arm jets from a few hundred feet and it would be game over. Or just wait until the pilot looked down to land and pop his ass.


Maybe send in armed drones first


Couldn’t they easily be gunned down in the air if they were really going to seize a boat carrying a large drug shipment?


Not a combat option but as a search and rescue device these have potential.


Nice.  Unless the bad guys have guns.


So are they only flying to unmanned ships because they seem easy picking


Just seem like expensive clay pigeons tbh...


Hey! There’s some of the money the pentagon lost!


Like clay pigeon shooting but with big, slow clays.


This will be useful for like coast guard to secure individuals who’ve capsized. I don’t think they’re dumb enough to use it to engage pirates.


Almost looks real!


Tax money? How much did we pay for those?


Onboard weapon systems and ammo add weight so the jet packs would need to be remodeled .


Yeah... I mean , I can say without having ever tried that I could eat cheese with my feet . Dosen't mean it's graceful or that I would actually do it for real and instead of my hands...


Smack them with an oar before they land and they drown.


Easiest double kill ever


Cool as this is. Your a sitting duck to an enemy(literally ). Keep working on it those. Making progress for sure.


These are cool. And also totally impractical, compared to alternatives.  Would be great fun to shoot out of the air.


Why this instead of using current drone tech? Having it stabilize for you, possibly a lighter rig to carry around, having onboard computers do most of the work? 

This seems really impractical in combat, but maybe practical for rescuing people.


What a suspiciously flat boat used in this demo. Almost like a regular boat would be exceptionally hard to land on.


Problem is they’re totally disabled upon making contact with the vessel. They’re hands are completely occupied and the equipment is cumbersome. 

There will be improvements, it’s not quite there yet


Why weaponize these when we could just use them to get around? So frustrating so frustrating(landfill doing popo voice)..


So, it’s heavy, bulky, extremely noisy, very slow, very short range, offers no protection for soldiers using it, has no ability to maneuver in a combat situation, no way to automate it for easier use, can only be used when the target boat is stationary, and cannot be used when seas are rough.

I just don’t see what this offers the military that a helicopter or a boat does not. The former is better in a planned operation, the latter is better in situations of opportunity.


If someone lands on my boat they had better have a warrant or they are getting shot.


Soon there will be Spartans


No downwash of air onto the water whilst flying?? Hmmm.. video a bit fishy.


Fuzz right-here.


Cool but they are 100% getting shot out the sky by the smugglers


These are so damn cool


I’m thinking a downfall of these for military use would be punctured fuel tanks or lines. Be particularly ugly in event of tracers or api rounds.


Can I get one too?? 🤩🥹😃


I feel like; if spotted - they would be an easy target no?


Question ... What if for whatever reason its just stops working while your over the ocean ?

is it easy to remove or is this a dragged to the bottom of the ocean thing


Seems like you’d be pretty vulnerable out there if something malfunctions or the smugglers open up on you with a rifle.


Hands


Pull.


As they approach with those stupid things on their hands, which make it impossible to defend themselves, I will put a couple of rounds down range without fear of reprisal.


Straight out of Red Alert


Every day we make the over the top animes look more and more not over the top.


What if you have an itch on your face? Do you spiral out of control?


Rockets in the sky!


I wonder how they can manage against strong winds and how much it will help the soldier drown if they fall on the water.


Are they not entirely vulnerable while in flight? They seem easy to shoot.


I wonder why no one has invented an aircraft that can take off vertically, carry multiple assault troops, hover in place as personnel repel out of the aircraft and even loiter in the area to offer support and extraction.


For Mandalore!


Cool and all, are there some defensive measure while two slow moving, low altitude targets make their way towards the target?  I imagine a couple of dudes on deck with AKs might make that a very short and failed mission.


Why would they test this stuff over water? Seems like a recipe for disaster ngl


They seem pretty vulnerable and can’t defend themselves at all until landing


I lazily assumed the title was search and rescue like the jet packs demonstration for mountain rescues and was very surprised to see them pull out a gun on the people they were "rescuing"


Someone out there in a cave already built a mach1 iron man suit with a box of scraps


Yeah this doesn’t seem very practical though.


Idiots!  That’s your own ship!


It's laughable how long it takes to draw a weapon. Jetpack are cool and all but holy shit, they're dead if they for real try to take over an armed... anything.


Might be a dumb question, but how do they defend themselves when they are airborne?  If the people have weapons, they look like easy targets.  Also if they are going to raid the boat or ship, that equipment looks super bulky. Wouldn't the time it takes to remove the jet pack so you can actually search the interior of the boat put you in a vulnerable position?


Fuckin FINALLY!! It took forever but we finally have practical bad ass jetpacks!!


Mexican cartel be like. 
"Wait they fly now"


To be fair they look vulnerable as balls to anything over and above a slingshot


Where is the shoulder mounted M60? Why are we not copying the predator?


wat a stupid idea. if I saw a Prince Harry on a jetpack I’d fire at him and cook hot dogs on the huge fireball.

jet packs have no purpose of any kind. they are merely for nobbish ruperts to boast


Can we just fly one for fun.


Seems a bit far fetched


Flying there and landing looks cool. But if those people already on the ship had guns, the jet packers would be dead


Look like a solution looking for a problem ? I mean, just for the military part, it would be probably useful for other things where you do not need to carry a gun.


Next resurgence update be like


This is the way


So they have 4 x130,000 rpm 1800 F jets on their hands while strapped to a big jug of jet fuel and flying into a potential gunfight. I guess it’s ok but oof


THEY FLY NOW?


Might be the coolest job on earth


Mand’alor has entered the chat


They would need to have some kind of robotic assisted legs to go with this in order to make the men portable and combat capable once they land. That looks super cumbersome to walk around with.


AD VICTORUM!


Imagine sipping on some bubbly on the water and seeing Boba Fett flying in on your ass


This is the way.


I want to know how quick.and easy it is to get out of the packs in the event of a water landing. What are the chances of drowning? Do they have flotation devices?


Somali pirates watch while salivating.


Just need a drone to follow them for cover


What do they run in?


Mando?


r/oddlyterrifying


I swear I thought I was watching Minority Report for a sec.


I would try to outrun them.  Also, I would
Fire flares at them as well as my hoses


The juggernauts are incoming..slowly


Just think how easily those things would get wrecked if you could somehow direct a blast of sand into the intake. I'm sure there some bomb out there that could explode and put a ton of it into the air that would wreck the system quick


You know what's really hard to swim in...


This new episode of The Mandalorian looks dope!


This is the Way


Don't you see that earth is not flat ?


They remind me of those tiny annoying bugs that you can’t see but you hear them fly around your ears


Minority report looking. Where are the precogs?


This is the way.


Holy crap


What does the thrust feel like on the arms? Do you have to be strong enough to hold the jets down?


What happens if they land in the water?


All in the name of the third temple.
This is truly terrifying stuff!


Minecraft sever admins


Them angels are coming sweet lord baby Jesus


They need a quick release for those packs, can't imagine how much they weigh.


"THEY FLY NOW!?" -FINN


Isn't there something in the Geneva convention about waiting for paratroopers to hit the ground before you shoot them? Does this apply for jetpacks?


I would imagine this would be done as a night time tactic. During the day, these guys would’ve gotten shot out of the air.


I smell rocket propelled grenade


Those backpacks are loud af, they’re not sneaking up on anybody!


that guys are seriouse .but like every single invention first custummer is army 🤷🏼


This reminds me of the elves that use jetpacks in the Santa clause movies.


America! F@ck ya!


So the are ELVS with attitude


Next stop ODM gear, les go!!!


Petty sure I'd shit myself if guys just came flying to my boat


This is a waste of time now with drones and massive pool of super talented video game players. Seriously, skip this. Jetpacks should be for fun.


This is REALLY cool but, I can’t see a practical use for these jet packs for military purposes


Just a really expensive, easy target.


CIWS vs these guys, ouch


That's how me and my homies do it. Go to the enemy base while they're AFK


So how do we not criticize the obvious impracticality? You think someone on a ship is just going to let you fly over without shooting at you midair while you're defenseless?


The Galbadians have arrived.


Inceptors with macroplasma cannons equipped


Johnny EFFIN Quest.


I see this not going well in a volatile situation.


Gotta zig-zag you noobs


So, abordage will be the future of marine combat?


We as citizens are SO fucked


Lol what about when they have to move and go into cabins


>Attempts to use these devices ended when on the first attempt both soldiers were taken hostage when they landed on the ship.  Soldiers responses to the study was "It would have worked perfectly if the smugglers waited patiently while I disconnected the controls and grabbed my rifle".  Further attempts have been cancelled on grounds that they're not confident that smugglers will in fact wait patiently.  Further funds have been reallocated to simply using a boats.


Y'know I see this and I think of the men who parachuted into lakes near Normandy and drowned because they were equipped with gear which couldn't be detached quickly enough to save themselves. I really do hope you can bail out of this suit quickly in the inevitable event someone loses control and hits the water because otherwise they've invented the world's most expensive flying anchor.


MURICA


I'd be worried about being shot down flying in cause you need both hands to fly so you have no way of defending your self


Totally not practical. Anyone with a gun on deck would shoot them out of the sky.


"The enemy can shoot them." Well, yes, that's how war works. People get shot at, no different than on the ground or on a boat. You think the military would send two dudes out without support to capture an enemy vessel? No they will have over watch to ensure the mission succeeds.


Yeah boi! Wait until someone is alive and opens up with a chaingun


This is one of the few things I’m okay with my tax dollars going to. 20 years from now we better have domestic jet packs so I can fly the fuck away anytime somebody tries to speak to me


Yes commander? On my way


Our taxes go here instead of universal healthcare lol


“We have determined that your injury is not service related.”


Waste of fucking money, realistically speeding people would shoot them down in the air…


You know this is fake and they're hanging from a chopper, the CGI the wire out post production. No sea spray or dust from the thrust and too smooth a flight.


San Andreas did it first


I know this is kinda old news but my brain is still processing that jet packs exist


They fly now?


Can they just shoot there arms or back and they are fucked? Besides just shooting them outright.


So what happens when they are shot out of the air?  Just wildly spin out of control into the water?  What offensive capabilities do they have while in the air?


I will ask once again. What is preventing a drone from doing the exact same thing with less risk?


Do not fly those in Chicago


I thought the title meant they were gunna have a seizure mid-air and fall


These guys would be dead before their feet hit the ground


Meanwhile in Russia they’ve got a line of mobiks wearing beanie hats jumping off the roof of a building, and RT will report that cumulatively they have hundreds of hours of individual flight time already.


Somali pirates are going to love owning jet packs.


God, I love the military industrial complex


Oh great. Now Pigs can fly.


The future is now old man


its  all fun flying in the air until the enemy has guns....


Thunderball


Add an exoskeleton suit with armor and we’re getting close to iron man suit.


All I see is two easily seen flying targets.


Can they float on water?


Why wouldn’t you just use drones?


“Those aren’t Mandalorians”


And then they get shot at while trying to take it off or deal with the extra weight while trying to get at the passengers


Watch these things get smaller futher down the line


Why is the military spending their money on this rather than something like a rideable drone? I feel like they could use the same propulsion on something they can ride instead and let's them use their weapons. It's not like they could even do anything since they have to operate the jets either their arms.


I would love to see the photos during R&D where one of these things blew up around someone's hand or maybe got their hand mangled or ripped off by this thing.


I wish there was a place that you could take a training course for these.  I really want to try one :)


Welcome to the fucking future.


lets all hope that the bad guys are deaf and cant shoot slow moving targets.


They're easy targets the whole way there.  Once they get to whatever vessel they're trying to take, they're sitting ducks I til they take the jet packs off their arms and then arm themselves.  

This is not a good idea until they're able to defend themselves on the way to the vessel and for the first few seconds after they land.


I remember seeing this for the first time in Command and Conquer Red Alert and wondering when it would be real


Lmao. Plink plink.

Cool tech, but still too unwieldy and clumsy to make sense for real use


I was thinking of someone searching for something but they have a seizure while using a jet pack lol


If the bad guys are nice enough to not shoot you down before you land on their ship, I can see this working pretty nicely.


"All fired up! Igniting boosters! Pushin' away!"


They fly now?


No chainswords? Pathetic


Losers


Yeah, that’s perfectly safe for everyone involved.


Reconnoiter only.  I bet those things are loud too, no stealth capability.  Just vulnerable reconnoitering only.  They'd get blasted in any armed conflict.


Realistically when would you use this because you would be an extremely easy target. Is there even fail safes for if you fall into the water?


I’ve seen this same demonstration with 3-4 different country’s militaries.  Are we just seeing an advertisement pretending to be news video?


That and notice how once they land, they sloppily switch to their primary and then just stand there because they have a hundred lbs of equipment strapped to them. One “this is Sparta” and they are sinking to the bottom ocean.


They don't show you the neural net driven drone swarm of loitering munitions that they'll advance under the cover of.


“Helmet steered suppressive capability” is the next phase of that. 

Think a small version of the M101 CROWS system. 

Or they just leapfrog to dropping off Boston dynamics attack dogs because 77% of Americans can’t pass the basic fitness requirements.


Well, if the boat being approached by the jetpack is told by the supporting vessel "if you shoot at our boarders we will sink you" that may give them pause.

These jetpack guys aren't travellung without support. I'd imagine it would be a death sentence for the offending boat if they attempt a shot.


And that is a pretty big, flat ass boat. It seems like boats big enough for this to be effective on, youd pull resources that are more efficient for this work. But, jet packs are fucking cool


Yeah if they could find some way to stabilize and shoot in the air this would be much for effective. But two guys bumblebee-ing toward and armed enemy seems like a fish in a barrel situation.


Give us a little bit more time, we just got to strap some guns to that and some eye targeting augmentations.
We'll have Ironmen in no time.

I'm waiting for a commercial release 😁🤤


True! My first thought was how vulnerable they were. The technology is new and the Military is desperately trying to figure out practical applications for it. The biggest challenge is just proving something is possible. I do see a great potential for this technology in rescue work.


I feel like these practice scenarios are done over open water where they're easy targets for safety since jetpacks are relatively unproven technology. 

I think any real military application of this lies in using them at night, and landing in a place where they'd be more difficult to shoot, like the highest rooftop in the surrounding area, or a cliff overlooking an area.


And adversaries simply need powerful fans to blow them away from the ship.


And what if the engine fails over water ? Is there some quick release to get all that off before it drags them under?


Also, it is too loud.  They are basically advertising adversaries that they are coming.


This is a practice Search and Seizure event. This would be replacing driving up in a boat, which you could also shoot the officers pretty easily. But do you want smuggling chargers or killing an officer charges?


These “jet pack” videos are nothing more than… _P.R. justifications_ for their MILLIONS OF DOLLARS lost in research slush funds😒


Thought the same thing. They need weapons IN the handles so they can be protected if need be. It’s like they’re trying to build the Ironman suit but left out the shoot from the hands part.


The jetpacks are cool, no doubt, but those 2 dudes are just sporting clays to anyone on that boat with a gun.


Combining it with a seizure sounds dangerous though.


This is The Way.


That are cool AF, but they can only fly about 30 seconds.


Cool for like 10 minutes until they run out of juice.


"PULL!"


My cute civilian DJI only hovers & spys, but that..it can attack


How would the enemy shoot at you when a navy destroyer is shooting at them while you board. These don't exist in a vacuum. If you bother to watch the video they show the integrated weapons system as well as state it's off for the demo


Blow Force?


Seems obvious to me you call these Guys mandolorians


Duke nukem


the jetpack shoes model.


Man bear pig?


I think we all assume this is military, but is it?  It looks like a private company dressed in fatigues and a camo boat. I don’t see any badges that are US military.

This is a Gravity jet pack by an English inventor… https://gravity.co  there is a video somewhere that chronicles his efforts. Pretty interesting, but really shows that this isn’t some low tech variety of some super secret ‘Murica tech.


I was thinking the same thing


Jet packs are not modern technology.  It's been around since 1919.


The most advanced technology that us civilians know about was used 15+ years ago by the military. They are significantly more advanced than we think.


I can’t imagine the inventors of this tech are stupid enough not to consider this


Yea. He did but nobody likes an argent show off.


Arrrr matey, scrub those flying dutchmen off the deck!


The shoulder-mounted-helmet-steered-predator-esque gun shooting back at you might beat the broomstick


It says "helmet steered suppressive capability", which appears to be that pistol on a stick.

So when their arms are busy they get a shoulder turret. Which is awesome.


Yeah, reading and comprehension comes a long way in these instances.


You can land and let go of them and do what you need to do.... you are bolted into them


The way they fly gives me Red Alert 2 vibes


A squad of what? Random guys on a boat who aren't anywhere near you while you fly *Duckhunt 2023* towards the opposing vessel?

What's the warship going to do? Sink or shoot the shit out of the platform you're trying to land on?

This whole idea is a helicopter but worse.


A squad of low speed airborne defenceless bricks.


At the very least, landing on a moving platform with a hundred pounds of top-heavy equipment will be difficult and dangerous.


Right, but what if there are several shooters sniping at you from multiple locations on board?


🤦‍♂️


Lmao


Read the caption at 35 seconds. Problem solved.


Isn't that what "helmet steered suppressive capability" is?


So they shouldn’t develop it at all? 

Comical when people critique something new because it’s not perfected yet. The Wright brothers got mocked as well.


It’s r&d is suppose. It can be useful to reach a specific place if you know it’s safe to land there. They’re clearly need drone support because they are so defensless.


If that were true for every scenario paratroopers and troop carriers wouldn't exist


Pretty sure that's what the "helmet controlled suppressive capability" is for. For helmet controlled suppressive fire, unless that means something else.


Everyone forgets these guys would be supported by suppressing fire. Google basic Infantry tactics. This is simply a force multiplier of an infantry or boarding unit. How do you think guys fast rope into combat, or board ships? With another group of people defending while they actually board.


You realise they’d be hopping over to you from a warship? With another 20 soldiers pointing barrels at you?


Good luck pushing them while they unload their mag into you 😂


These are being deployed for mountain search and rescue aswell, lowering response time from 30-45 minutes down to under 5. Still think they are a waste?


I don't know if it's a horrific waste of money, more like an awesome waste of money.  Now, if they developed a robot soldier that only killed puppies, that would be a horrific waste of money.


What if I told you this is a private company called Gravity Industries and you're being butthurt for no reason. 

More info [here ](https://ia800603.us.archive.org/11/items/FBIMG1497529407294/FB_IMG_1497529407294.jpg)


There is a BIG difference in an unmanned drone being heard, seen, and shot at versus a human in a loud jetpack with their hands needed to maneuver who gets shot at. Drones getting taken out is a loss of money. A soldier getting taken out is a loss of a life. Why shouldn't people be worried about safety?


Have you ever seen any footage of how boarding a ship works? How do you plan on "just shooting them" with 20mm auto cannons destroying you from the navy cutter these guys launched from?


They use them for mountain rescue so not necessary


They have a helmet steered weapons system onboard if you watch the video. It's stated plainly they have it turned off for the demo


Go look them up. Gravity Industries. They have a ton of videos landing on all sorts of stuff


Like any other vehicle


Or just use an armed and armored boat and do it the tried and true way.


They need some predator style shoulder lasers


Or, hear me out, try to walk though an interior hatch.


Yeah you can see the guy wobbling back and forth just trying to balance that whole machine on his back. Not to mention they’re showing this off with a boat scenario and boats are always rocking around this would never work.


Everyones got a plan until they get punched in the jaw


Crowd control


That sounds more realistic than I'm comfortable imagining.  Drone swarms to overwhelm defenses and then jetpack in instead of an airdrop.

Even just jetpacking in for the last 1/2 mile to a raid is crazy.

Wonder how far these things can realistically go.


Gonna be honest I think about the day we introduce Boston Dynamic's robotics into warfare a lot. Its inevitable and the implications of that will be insane. The amount of tech you can fit on those bots, the amount of armor, the carrying capacity for munitions, the mobility alone makes the average American soldier look like an average dude. Those things can do backflips, man. Crazy days ahead.


Even still - the enemy 50 yards out has a better chance of picking you off before you can aim anything accurate with…your helmet? Okay. 

Very cool but long ways off for anything combat related imo

Would love to fly to work like this though, ha


"You don't have abs, so we're going to let this robot get shot instead of you" is the best argument I've ever heard for being fat


I'm thinking it has applications in a naval capacity, think like anti piracy boarding of a container ship or similar when a sniper is covering you from the deck of a friendly vessel. But there may be hostages below deck. Obviously very niche application but it's always good to have more options.  


I think it would cool to see these guys deploy from a helicopter with less loiter time than rappelling (also a situation where you are very vulnerable)


everyone is talking about the practicability of them in this situation but all I can think about is how its fucking cool that we have these


Not if you send in a bunch of drones first with small munitions to disrupt defenders


Pretty much all special operations troops do water survival training, I'm sure that was a consideration even when doing these tests


My thought exactly.


Yeah, imo if they cant defend themselves while fliying that could be a certain death in a real battlefield


Especially if the sharks get some frickin laser beams


If you think something like this would happen in the middle of the day, you clearly know nothing about spec ops


If the packs fail over water, seems like a good way to drown your guys


Yeah, but technology is developing fast, in few years those jetpacks would probably be smaller and more quiet.
So they could be used more stealthy.


Soon they will have the predator auto aiming laser cannon on their shoulders or something like what they will put on the robot dogs


This is The Way


The Navy isn't going to be firing down range with their pilots flying towards the target.

Why would you fire at a ship you're trying to board?


Precisely. These will be most effective deployed from destroyers at night. They make a rapid advance onto the deck while people on board are filled with god ol' Freedom


Well, yeah, they have to use a rocket version for vacuum.


Yeah that's... just not going to be happening


and here i stand corrected... tho i'd still argue that those troopers should be somewhat equiped with a little bit of protection to reliably succeed and return sound and safe...


The Navy isn't going to be firing down range with their pilots flying towards the target.

Why would you fire at a ship you're trying to board?


*slow clap* 👏


Are you cereal?


Likely so, the military had still seen it and may have passed on it.  Still the now secret tech is interesting


Oh, the squirckens? What about them?


Yum, sounds good.


Any examples you can give?


Boomstick>broomstick


If they could read this would probably be an constructive comment


“How do solve the problem of hands free shooting while flying?” 

(Door bursts open) 

“YOU GUYS, I GOT IT FIGURED OUT! So I was watching Predator, and had an epiphany”.


[deleted]


They're flying off a navy vessel 😂

How much and what kind of suppressing fire do you need


Not if like 10 doodz are shooting at you


You got a good point there. Maybe it is already now more useful than I first thought :)


That's theory. Never happens in real or else all wars would end within a week.


They can do it without that shit. And sorry but im talking about real world, not movie. Nobody will fire at their own troops if they are on the same ship. Sorry if you cant use your brain


Yes. I bet you they have saved zero lives. Might even have caused a few deaths.


It’s private company doing a defense contract, I.e. tax payer money. Why don’t you let the dissenters have our opinions?

Those who feel this is a splurge of resources and just plain impractical are free to do so. Those who enjoy it for it’s simple awe and wonder that’s awesome too.


Pretty sure you missed my point, which is that you can send drones ahead of the flyers to protect them


Why would you be boarding a ship that you've annihilated with 20mm cannon rounds?


Yeah I know, thus why I said “when they look down”


Well a normal vehicle weight and balancing aren’t as much of an issue so critical areas can be armored, this not so much.


I thought "Helmet steered suppressive capability" would be a shoulder weapon?


I was thinking of a buddy drone that either strike before you land or hovers close to your person.


Yup, or drone support with small arms attached. It's awesome tech, but without an exoskeleton body armor, they are basically flying targets.


Would be sick and so terrifying


It mentions helmet steered sur pressure capability


Along the same lines I was thinking you could have a gun setup on the pack being remotely controlled by a guy back on the main ship to defend them on the approach before they can get their guns out. Although if you’re doing a remote operator setup maybe an armed drone would just be more effective.


If that boat was moving, hell, probably even if it had been parked parallel to the waves, they wouldn’t have been able to stand on it.


How are you going to mess up a Mike Tyson quote?

"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face,"
Mike Tyson.


What stops them from just blasting someone in the face with the hand nozzles like Shiri from black panther? The geniva convention?


And that’s just public information. Imagine what’s happening in black budget programs. And I know BD is a public company (owned by Hundai in case anyone is wondering) trying to commercialize Spot… but still…


Helmet aiming is already a proven technology in attack choppers. The 30mm gun is aimed by the gunners helmet. Sure, 30mm is a lot larger than weapons these people would caryy, but that tech also engages at much larger distances and higher velocities.


I’m not debating the effectiveness of it. Just giving the DARPA glossary of terms breakdown. 

If my personal experience is any indicator they will spend a few hundred million more on it while the shiny shoes salivate and the dirty boots tell them the issues that they will continue to ignore.  Then eventually scrap it for a unmanned version. 

The Ukrainian war effectively negated Gen 5 jets just by being necessarily adaptable to lack of financial resources. Not unlike the Taliban double stacking A/T mines to destroy MRAPS. No matter what you design a desperate monkey with a hammer will find a way to overcome it. 

Richard’s jet packs have a place in the world. But I’m really hoping it isn’t a military application. I’m tired.


Meh, eye tracking software is used regularly in multiple VR systems already.  Its plausible the same technology could evolve into use for targeting.  Sure it's not there yet, but that doesn't mean it's not feasible.  [It's definitely already being developed though](https://www.thomasnet.com/insights/eye-tracking-technology-takes-jet-pilots-to-new-heights/).  [Second example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/c3ha4e/apache_helicopter_with_a_30mm_gun_that_can_be/).

A real issue I see with any kind of shooting while flying a jetpack, is how well the jetpack setup handles recoil.  You'd need multiple shots to reliably take down a target while flying to begin with.  So that pretty much means burst fire or FA.  Which means you have another thrust vector to factor in at the very least.  As to how sensitive these jetpacks are to that sort of thing, I have no idea.  But I suspect anything that complicates your control of something like this is going to have a steep learning curve.


Maybe a fast team SF night insertion but those packs are loud and the cost of leaving that gear on the ground to continue a mission would be crazy expensive.


The first tanks looked shit and had loads of problems too. Give it time


Imagine the noise and thermals those make

Don't talk about knowing about specops


Because night optics weren't invented in the 60s or anything.


You're right. I don't. That being said, I don't need to be a spec operative to see that I wouldn't need daylight to shoot those two down lol


Not really, there is a limiting factor here. In order to get a human off the ground you have to push enough air at the ground to counter their body weight. You’re not going to get quieter jet packs because just the very sound of all that air moving is ear splitting.

We’ve had helicopters for like 80 years and they are still ridiculously loud. There are some things you just can’t engineer away.


They will be pretty easy targets for an auto aiming laser cannon.


What do you think movement under suppressing fire is for? Military units literally train to do exactly that. They move to advance or flank enemy positions while their team mates or other squads keep the enemy suppressed. It's why so many bullets get used in combat. To keep the enemy behind cover while you advance. This is the absolute basics of Infantry. Google *bounding overwatch*. Or watch literally anything about basic Infantry tactics


All the naysayers are acting like the greatest military powers on earth haven't figured this out when it's literally a demo 🤣


🤣 very clever


Tell me you have no understanding of the military without telling me


Super cereal


They're from ..... Montreal..


I'm a civilian. Why would I know any examples?


Yeah the French have a flying board instead that leaves your arms free while flying


Sorry for my aggressiveness man


It's still in R&D, and WILL be invaluable to first responders. Imagine scaling to the top of a burning sky scraper in seconds and saving people....


Because you're wrong and like to be butthurt despite that fact.  Gravity Industries works with military units around the world to perfect the concept and at this point the only tax money spent, mostly on demos like this, would have been spent on training exercises anyway. You're presuming your precious taxes are building these jetpacks and that's absolutely false. You can have whatever opinion. You cannot have your own facts. Why don't you focus on actual waste of tax dollars instead of presumed ones

negative people are exhausting, particularly when butthurt because they're uninformed 🤷


Or you send drones and don't try to make humans fly because it's stupid.  


Just use the drones.


It's an example you cold toilet seat of a human 😂
Obviously. They don't have those on all boats. It would be situation specific 🤦‍♂️

Christ you people are tedious. Looking Ng for a problem with everything


It looks like a Glock rigged up to the “arm” coming off of the right shoulder.


Send a mannequin in the jet back + 2 drones, job done


How are you going to mess up a Mike Tyson quote?

"Everyone hath a plan until they get punched in the faith"

- Mike Tyson


Mike says mouth, not face.


>If my personal experience is any indicator they will spend a few hundred million more on it while the shiny shoes salivate and the dirty boots tell them the issues that they will continue to ignore. Then eventually scrap it for a unmanned version.

Absolutely.

Some folks don't know the Acquisition process... which may or may not be a good thing.


And the packs can only fly about 30 seconds before they run out of fuel. That's another reason they are not popular.


Most advanced US fighter jets have a HUD that tracks the pilots retna movement to aim the mounted guns. All a pilot has to do is look at the target and pull the trigger. Kinda cool.


yeah with time they will get smaller and probably become available for the general public.


Isn’t everything?


There's no suppressing fire involved in boarding a ship lol


Agreed. Never understood why some people online think they’ve thought of something the entire US military and all the engineers working for them have somehow just missed but they noticed. Especially when it’s something as painfully obvious as what some of the ignoramuses here think they’ve noticed as a flaw


I am aware of this technology's youth, but this will eventually improve. Mandalorian jetpack here we come


How is this better than a normal boat?


No, those are squebeckens, easy mistake.


Any exemple of 

"the most advanced technology that us civilians know about was used 15+ years ago by the military"


How the hell is someone going to fly over a burning building and do... anything?  
Throw them from the windows while he hovers?


Omg you aren't kidding. Did not see that first time around. I want to see it in action now


It really is crazy though because there's articles that say both. So I guess we just chalk it up to mandela.


Just like tanks


HAHAHAHA

I'm sorry, did you just claim to understand every scenario in which fire support is used by troops in a boarding scenario? Because you can go to you tube and watch videos of multiple militaries around the world doing exactly that. Especially against narcos 

thanks for contributing 😁

Edit: oh no a down vote from a clown who larps in tac gear


Even if a ground soldier controlled a suit mounted gun. Then the flier could land, further secure the boat and wait for the boarding raft to arrive shortly after.


It’s a great quote either way for sure 🤙🏾


Wait until those monkeys find out they have to do timesheets


This just seems like a Borg origin story.


“It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.”


It just keeps typing “KILL ME PLEASE GOD WANT BANANA RELEASE ME FROM THIS TORTURED EXISTENCE WHERE TOY”


I will let literally everyone in the world go ahead and get one of these before I do.


Is this how we get to full self driving, a monkey in every Tesla.


Ultron will be made real, and it's gonna be a pissed off monkey cyborg looking for revenge for hundreds of monkey deaths.


looks like they discovered reedits mods.


Infinite monkeys plus infinite telepathic typing equals Twitter.


Get a room full of these bad boys together, they’ll write you some Shakespeare!


First, Musk creates Mojo Jojo, 

then he's gonna accidentally mix some Space X chemicals with sugar, spice, and everything nice.


Oh you mean like medical tech that’s been around since like 2005? But like safely and in humans?


Hey everyone, remember me from before I was twitter’s biggest troll??


Not too long before monkeys are doing everything for Hello Fresh


Didn’t this kill a lot of monkeys as well?


How 'bout the power to kill a yak from 200 yards away... 
with mind bullets! That's telekinesis, Kyle.


[deleted]


Think about this product for 15 seconds to continue


This is neat.  I worked in a BCI lab back in 2008, and have typed an email with my mind before.  Our system used an external EKG though and had a really bad bit rate, so I was typing about 2 words per minute.  I tried to find the demo in the video but it's kind of long, how fast were the monkeys typing here?

One of the other guys in the lab had a project with embedded electrodes in people.  It's not ethical to stick electrodes in healthy human brains for experiments since they can cause problems, but some people need them for other treatments.  I think some type of epilepsy, iirc? Anyway, he had a system that ran off the hardware they already needed, and had a pretty good setup for playing pong and space invaders mentally.


Tortured animals. F Elon. And everyone who works at that facility. Let’s hope someone in our government shuts this shit down


"I knew if I just kept killing monkeys, eventually one would live through the experiment, and it only took 372,965." - Elon probably


Great, mind control isn’t going to be used horribly in the future. So much to look forward to 😒


Whatever the monkey is doing in this video, it is not "typing". It may be looking at the brighter letter, which is preset, and then a predictive keyboard may be filling the blanks. This can be achieved with an eyetracker. Not sure what the role of the chip even is here.


I’ll just leave [this](https://youtu.be/yddbGcKYtn4) here.


At least [8 monkeys](https://neuralink.com/blog/animal-welfare/) were killed out of at least [23 monkeys](https://www.kcra.com/article/elon-musks-brain-implant-company-neuralink-accused-of-abusing-monkeys-during-research-at-uc-davis/39049960#) were killed for this experiment, but hey, now you can receive Elon's tweets directly to your brain.  
Oh, and they plan on euthanizing this monkey even though this implant appears successful.


As a nurse, I have worked with quadriplegics. It appears likely that this will lead directly or indirectly to technological advances that help them. It also appears likely that the people who don't care about quadriplegics will succeed in slowing that progress significantly. I'm not saying that there aren't any problems with Neuralink. There are serious problems with it. There were serious problems with surgery in the distant past. It got better.


Elon musk fakes all his “demo videos” I’ll believe it when a 3rd party gets their hands on it and can test it themselves. Until then, this is definitely a monkey watching a video.


Definitely let the guy who thinks more code is better code put a chip in your brain.


God. Just what I want, Elon musk in my brain.


I mean, the video shows a monkey and a keyboard. I don't trust Elon to show an undoctored video. Also, why doesn't that monkey move like, at all? Is it frozen? One of the dead monkeys?


Not I. Only chips I’m putting in my head are Doritos.


If they learn to code, we're fucked.


The monkey, typing:

> #K-I-L-L
> #M-E


98% of the monkeys had their brain's fried but hey this one monkey is smashing a keyboard with his brain we promise!!!


That’s a customer service rep from my local cable company


Now coming his biggest brain move of all, give Neuralink to paraplegics and hire them as Twitter mods


MOJO JOJO


I feel like the chance of a monkey typing *Hamlet* just went up by orders of magnitude


Yeah but they’ll still have to pay their $8 for the blue check


No banana and no TV make Harambe go something something….


The One Who Lived


Yeah, but where's the video of the dead monkeys?


How influencer  blogs are written


They don’t show you the monkeys dying from cyber psychosis.


man made horrors beyond my comprehension


All work and no play makes jack a dull boy

All work and no play makes jack a dull boy
...
All work and no play makes jack a dull boy


Cyberpunk Monke.


Haramb-AI


Well, if someones going to fraudulently abuse your investment money it had better atleast be interesting, so there's props to that


Not telepathic, it's bluetooth.


Just get 999 more of them and we can write some Shakespeare


What’s really going to make this technology miserable are the ads.


Each of these monkeys have died horrible deaths as a result of these implants.


So like, the science is cool, I guess. But what problem are we actually solving? For any sort of invasive surgery like this the risk has to be sufficiently low for the possible benefit, and as far as I can tell the risk here is huge and the benefit is uh… I don’t have to use a keyboard? Not convinced.

Edit: actually, one instance I can think of where this might be useful, as an accessibility tool. This might provide a way that people with paralysis can interact beyond what is available today. But still…


“K-I-L-L.. M-E..”


What did it type though? Did it type 
Ishendfofudbdlsiehenfflfirhendodudrbdodudndeoeirhrbr?


"It's Morse Code. He's saying 'Kill Me'. Repeated over and over. Just 'Kill Me'".


This is the biggest oversell since fully self driving cars


What it doesn’t show is the thousands of dead monkeys and the absolute bs that this is ready for humans in 6 months …


If you have an ounce of faith in something with Elon's name attached to it I do not trust your judgement one bit


How long til we get the works of Shakespeare?


Another overhyped elon musk production... it will totally work...


It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.


Hey, Elon we have a live one. What shall we do with it?

Oh you know do experiments with it and then destroy it.


Based on what I read, I believe the poor monkeys suffered. I will pray to black Jesus for Musk to reap *all* that he sowed. [News article on the alleged suffering of innocent animals](https://nypost.com/2022/02/10/elon-musks-neuralink-allegedly-subjected-monkeys-to-extreme-suffering/)


I think this is terrible. What they are doing is torture.


Knowing about Elon's track record, this is probably fake...


Can we trust anything coming from tesla at this point ?


"kill... me..."


No way I’m letting that dipshit anywhere near my brain


Torture enough monkeys and eventually they’ll produce Shakespeare, or however the saying goes


98% of the trial monkeys died in agony fron infection after the procedure fuck musk


Yeah it's going to be fake just like all of elons futuristic bullshit that ends up on these subs.

Guessing hes got a timeline that is waaaaaay off too


It’s just the infinite monkey theorem, but they just stare at a screen now instead of hitting a keyboard.


We still have no idea what "ooh ooh ahh ahh" means.


how many monkeys died so we can watch a monkey type on a screen


... holy fucking shit. HOKY FUCKING SHIT!

It all makes sense now. This was the plan. Goddammit Elon you got me. 

He's literally training Monkeys to work at Twitter.


When you find out the horrible shit the monkeys went through testing this fucking thing…


Extreme cruelty at the hands of Elon Musk.


Elon Musk is a professional bullshit artist. I wouldn't be surprised at all if all of this was actually faked.

Here are some of my very favorite bold ass lies and insane claims.

* 12/31/2014 - "We are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall & connects like a solid metal snake. For realz."
* 09/23/2015 - "My guess is probably we could break 1,000 kilometers within a year or two. I'd say 2017 for sure."
* 01/06/2016 - "In \~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY."
* 05/05/2020 - "I'm starting a candy company & it's going to be amazing. I am super super serious."
* 05/16/2018 - "The Boring Company will be using dirt from tunnel digging to create bricks for low cost housing."
* 07/15/2018 - "You know what, don't bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."
* 03/19/2020 - "Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April"
* 03/20/2020 - ["Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too"](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/17/tech/elon-musk-ventilators-california/index.html)

Ok but actually why would we want one.  Like what purpose would this serve to me.


I will downvote all posts about neuralink, and so should everyone else. I don't care how supposedly revolutionary any thing they come up with is, they did it by massively unethical means and they should not be celebrated. Downvote me all you want, Musk butt buddies, I really don't care.


Imagine letting troll Elon in your brain.


Funny how an impressive technology that will enable paralyzed people to say to their family that they love them transformed from modern day miracle and a marvel, into dystopian scary thing solely based on how the internet sees Elon Musk.


Is this before or after he chewed his fingers off?


Ah, the one monkey that wasn’t euthanized.

None of their results matter if they aren't able to install implants SAFELY in the subject that are resistant to signal degradation over time, which is the main problem with all BCI implants as far as I'm aware.


Didn’t something like 18/23 monkeys implanted die though?


Poor fucking animals that have been tortured to death for this shit


So since this is an Elon project, we can assume this is all faked and there’s no way it actually works? It’s just a screen record of someone typing plus a monkey in front of said screen. Remember The Boring Company? Remember landing on Mars by this year? Remember the god-awful “graphic” of a mars colony that was made in Blender in a day?


Let’s talk about Synchron instead.  They’re helping patients already [Synchron](https://synchron.com/)

Looks like more musk bs.


Look. While I am no Musketeer, unlike reddit I actually like the guy. I respect him, and think he's a reasonably well intentioned person. 

But there is absolutely NO way I would trust that man to put a chip in my brain. He is not the kind of person anyone should trust with something like that.

Tesla future sale: 1x clinically depressed monkey.


“WHERE TOY” is making me giggle so hard idk why


I don’t think that I’ll ever want to own a monkey. Too many stories of unhinged rage.


I'm too lazy to google, but I guess some people with locked-in syndrome (due to ALS or something) will be first. This is supposed to be a device to offer ways to interact with the outside world for those, who are currently not able to.


From 2017-2020, at least 15 monkeys died out of 23 monkeys implanted with neural ink chips.

With odds like those, sign me up!

>>Neuralink chips were implanted by drilling holes into the monkeys’ skulls. One primate developed a bloody skin infection and had to be euthanized. Another was discovered missing fingers and toes, “possibly from self-mutilation or some other unspecified trauma,” and had to be put down. A third began uncontrollably vomiting shortly after surgery, and days later “appeared to collapse from exhaustion/fatigue.” An autopsy revealed the animal suffered from a brain hemorrhage.


They are for people that have locked in syndrome and the like - if you were completely paralysed would you reconsider?


Hardcore Elon fans will soon have viruses downloaded directly into their melons.


Wow what an attitude. You don’t want telepathic ads being beamed into your head? You hate innovation???


Their target customers are paraplegics. Atleast till the tech is proven.


Oh, absolutely. 

Unless I'm completely paralyzed, then I would be very much interested in such technology.

Being able to communicate again, or even play video games again would be a huge quality of life boost for completely paralyzed people.


It’s designed for people who are quadriplegic, to enable them to more easily communicate with the world.


Well considering 15/23 of the monkeys died and they still want to start human trials in 6 months. No thanks.

Explains the last 7 years of Twitter


It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.


Anything to have a daughter that doesn’t disown him I guess


And this is no different from the very first demonstration of Neuralink. A monkey can't write, so it's as "impressive" as when a monkey can't play pong.


Wouldn’t be surprised if Elon let a monkey behind neuralink control his account for these past months.


I barely view him differently from back then. He's always engaged in internet culture, in a way that may or may not be cringe..


I don’t hear a single conversation from the right about this. But somehow the vaccine was mind control. Crazy


Wasn't it mentioned a few days ago that this procedure had like a 90% mortality rate?


All monkeys leave that testing lab as a pile of ash. Successful or unsuccessful, these monkeys hold company secrets and are euthanised when they have run their course.

I believe it was said in an interview just after the pig live-demo


How do you think we got to this point


I can't believe I had to scroll so far to find this comment. It has over a 98% failure rate. This has killed thousands of monkeys.

Animal testing that is regulated by the FDA puts down the animals after being tested on. 

That is not the case here. They keep them alive after fucking with their brains. They observe them suffering and then inevitably dying a horrible death.

Fuck anyone who supports this.


Science cannot move forward without heaps!


The amount of harm done to monkeys is sad, but this is most of science. Animal testing has saved countless lives. In this case, the cost of many monkey lives will likely save hundreds of thousands more humans. Would you Quintus? Would I?


Wouldn’t surprise me. Musk doesn’t want a buncha experimental cyber monkeys running around all over the place


This one probably only survived long enough for the demonstration only. Apparently to the joy of redditors, before it likely deteriorated further in it's health and instead of helping it, neuralink opted to kill it like every other one they've tortured until deemed not useful to experiment on.


We do not understand brains enough to make this a safe thing for literally anyone


Of course and. Brutally tortured them. It's disgousting.


Yes and they want to start human trials next year


How 'bout the power ... to move you


Yeah, how many monkeys did it take to find one that randomly was able to do something?

The entire Neuralink enterprise is ethically dicey to begin with, the last thing I want to see is a "hardcore" guy at the wheel.


Its about 29 minutes into the video.

Looks reasonably fast, maybe 1 key every second or so. Mobile style keypad so it has individual letters and word suggestions. Would have been a significant speed boost for Stephen Hawking.


He says that like 5 seconds after the video starts, it's to demonstrate controllability via the implant, a human could pick whatever they wanted. I don't see the reason to use this over just eye tracking software though.


This is what the monkey is doing. Only no eye tracker, all brain sensor input.


But it’s *not* being achieved with an eye tracker. That’s the entire point of the demo. 

The chip is interpreting the signal impulses in the monkey’s brain directly. Originally they mapped these impulses with a connected joystick, and then when they unplugged the joystick, the monkey could still move the cursor. 

If the monkey isn’t writing anything, but it’s definitely typing with its mind. If you don’t classify selecting the correct letter when prompted as “typing”, what would you call it when a young child uses a learn-to-type program?


Elon Musk is the biggest bull shit artist, that’s all you need to make money these days.


What IS the latest on BMIs? Is there something even remotely promising that’s not BS?


would he be worthy of his family's name if he wasn't torturing and stealing for profit?


Holy crap!


The issue people have isn’t with the concept in general. Also you’re conflating ‘the technology’ with ‘Neuralink’. 

Elon is not only psychopathic, but is also not doing this for noble means (as you would argue yesteryear’s surgeons were). He’s doing it to further acquire money and power through the capitalistic apparatus. 

People aren’t saying brain interface research should stop. People are saying that this man shouldn’t be the one calling the shots.


I’m looking forward to the hopeful “NeuraLink Technology Helps Quadriplegics Move Again” followed by the inevitable “NeuraLink Patients Dismayed to Discover New Mobility and Freedom is a Subscription Service”


None of this is really novel in new btw.


I don't think "people who don't care about quadriplegics" are the ones skeptical of this news.  It's more that this is yet another barely evidenced "breakthrough" from the same guy who's been fraudulently promising hyperloops and self-driving cars, every few months, for nearly a decade now.  Every time, it's been Musk versus independent scientists and engineers; and every time, Musk has been shown to have been drastically misrepresenting these projects to inflate his own worth and ego.  Maybe this one project will be the one that bucks the trend and actually works; but one look at his past trends should engender a boatload of skepticism.


The idea that mind-machine interfaces can help quadriplegics is not a new one, or a wrong one. But looking to fucking Elon Musk for that, or taking this demonstration as proof of what it appears to be, is a recipe to get fucking scammed.

This is the guy who lied about so many of the other demos he's pulled. Check out our car--except it's not our car, it's a different car that we put our car's frame on top of, because *we don't have a car.*

You don't think other labs haven't been working on "let's hook prosthetics up to the brain" for fucking yonks? We can support that stuff instead of the latest self-promotional bullshit from repeat scam artist Elon Musk, and we should, or else we're liable to find ourselves in another situation where we find out the whole Tesla Tunnel thing was a grift to stop public transportation spending.


10 years ago my neuromancer boner would have been at full battle stations. 

Now the only things I can think about with a brain implant under capitalism are along the lines of “how much will I have to pay to unlock the features I want?”, how much will I have to pay to NOT have Nazi tweets beamed directly into my brain?” and “dear god, what metrics are they collecting to market bullshit to me?”

Let's see Elon test it next.


Is there a source to that? Or is it made up.


How many animals died or lived in agony as a result of your eating habits, just this year? 

Cost of science and progress. At least that's better than us just mindlessly eating bacon because it tastes good.


Like Tesla, Starlink, or SpaceX?


The video goes in-depth. Apparently it can be used eventually to stimulate sight in blind ppl, and movement/sensation for quadriplegic/tetraplegic ppl.


One day, we'll be tracked and monitored and personalized ads will follow us everywhere we go. And I mean *everywhere.*

One day, victims will be able to contact the police and report crimes with their minds.  And cops will be able to track who (suspects) are physically near the distressed callers. That should reduce crimes like robbery, rape, kidnapping, etc.

One day, you won't have to go to the doctor. If you feel sick, your implant data can be uploaded to your doctor or an AI system and you'll find out exactly what's wrong with you.

And most importantly, one day, you'll be able to order a pizza with your mind.


All of the people that could have their entire lives changed by this. Seriously thank you.


So it’s OK to harm animals to eat bacon or chicken nuggets from McDonald’s but scientific research involving the brain harms a few monkeys and suddenly it’s the worst thing in the world.? 

You guys have fragile little man child brains.


Uhhhh, something very similar has been already done at Duke university almost 20 years ago. This is nothing new or anything special and doesn't deserve any special praise


>an impressive technology

This is not new at all.  Progress does not come from wild promises.


I'm sure it works because he's really just replicating old research. 

They feature the experiment in a BBC Horizon episode called "Human 2.0" that's nearly 20 years old


The future is coming. Yikes but also not yikes?


Certainly an interesting design. I do wonder how well they're able to target the bandwidth of the stentrode towards specific areas of the brain to better connect to e.g. the motor cortex.

Their demo video has several visible cuts just from one of their patients trying to scroll down a webpage, but that could be down to lack of training/neural integration.


Fact checking link showing this isn’t true - https://www.verifythis.com/amp/article/news/verify/technology-verify/usa-today-did-not-report-elon-musk-neuralink-killed-3000-monkeys/536-16f1a9ba-3005-4aff-bf17-97e7b7b676be


Apparently the 3000 number is from a fake screenshot. The real number is around 15. Not sure how many monkeys were in the trial, but I’ve seen a 21% death rate mentioned in a few different places.


You’d be trusting the scientists, doctors and engineers. Musk has no real input in what his companies design.

Just like he didn’t invent reusable rockets, he didn’t invent this. Scientists and engineers did.


That’s fake news and you’re spreading misinformation


No they got targeted by an anti animal testing group

Or like when Clara was inside the dalek


when Elon said “actually our monkeys are really happy” he was referring to the fact that their neuralinks picked up the words “thank god the bliss of sweet release” as they were fading to black


the year is 2036, an army of monkeys land on the battlefield in Afghanistan for their first deployment. They are the best of the best, having spent 20 hours a day playing Call of Duty: Monkey Apocalypse for five years, rewarded with a powerful orgasm for every headshot


the real miracle is they trained the monkeys to believe that sucking scientist dick is a reward for typing


Bro idk if you saw Nope but there is a scene involving a violent monkey that had me shook.


It already seems these monkeys have access to Reddit.


Unhinged, like the jaw that monkey just ripped off someone’s face and threw across the room.


Plus ethical issues. Idk about commitment issues, but it’s basically like having an 8 year old for 60 years

Yeah, then 28 days later you're in a zombie apocalypse.

My dad suffered from expressive aphasia and was able to drive, make an online business selling things on eBay, use emojis to communicate via text, copy and paste things to communicate, but he couldn’t speak. I feel like this would’ve been good for him if he was still around.


They'll need to show the benefits of this device outweighing the pretty obvious risks especially as it compares to noninvasive/less invasive methods of non-verbal/locked-in communication.

I've seen nothing to convince anyone that these electrodes would be viable long term. Lots of electrodes get covered over by glia and become non-functional. Who wants neurosurgery AGAIN to remove and replace electrodes?


Most importantly the main studies done on it were done by people no longer with the company, who want nothing to do with the company. The guy who replaced the first CEO just copied the study and pretended it was his. When he got called out on that he quit the job. After that Musk republished the study with his own name down as the researcher.

He's a con man, a liar and this thing won't ever do shit. All Musk is doing is torturing animals to death, lying to try to get investors money and pump company value so he can leverage it's worth into loans for other projects and if there are ever human trials, he'll torture them to death as well.


>From 2017-2020, at least 15 monkeys died out of 23 monkeys implanted with neural ink chips.

Are there stats for 2021+2022 that show a lower death rate or did they just not do any implants in the last two years?  

The reason they test on monkeys first is for just this type of situation where they don't have the proper process down pat and hopefully they eventually get to the point where it is safe enough that it can be considered for humans.


Most brain implant studies have a 100% death rate as the animals are typically disected afterwards to look for damage. Sad but a necessary part of this sort of research.

Comparatively, 100s of thousands of animals die each year in cosmetics testing.


All this monkey business got me [thinking](https://giphy.com/gifs/misc-brad-pitt-4MeureSJCsTjG)


Need to update the “weird nerds” meme so that Apu is a Borg.


Already happened


We already do that with propaganda.


Please god add the /s.


That’s not how that works… as with any biotech/medical test study, every animal used in that study will be euthanized before it leaves the lab, as such they specifically used monkeys with preexisting conditions that didn’t much longer to live, a lot of those deaths are completely unrelated to the brain implant.


That explains their recent marketing slogan. 

"With NeuraLink, Trunk monkey is comin' up front."

(NeuraLink takes no responsibility for the vengeful,  murderous actions of your Trunk Monkey chauffer)

I, for one, love and support the basilisk.


You're only making monkey ultron angrier.


I hear that only 15% survived the implant. That’s an insane level of animal cruelty. How is anyone supposed to respect a guy like that?

To make matters worse, they all suffered horribly. Just read these descriptions

Lol. Reddit is so embarrassingly gullible.

You should be ashamed.


We'll call that one a coincidence.


can someone spare an explain


Blame the monkeys


Stupid monkey


It's almost as impressive as the 15 monkeys who died from the implants


The very first demonstration of Neuralink was a blatant copy of Nicolelis' work from 2008 and earlier.


>a monkey

More like a slew of them. Don’t they keep dying?

As a great man once said

“STOP EXPLODING, YOU COWARDS!”


“I don’t care if the testing isn’t finished!!! Send me two dozen Mind Monkeys^TM”


I think we would have noticed the improvement in his tweets if that happened.


I really wish people would stop using the word "euthanized" for this type of thing. I don't really have a problem with (responsible) animal testing as it is a necessary evil in many cases, but let's not pretend any of this is done out of mercy or for their own good.


Well, a lot of humans end up as a pile of ash too. What matters is the quality of life before that point.

Neuralink used to contract with US Davis' primate lab, the early experiments did end up with a number of dead monkeys. Here's a [press release](https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/doctors-sue-uc-davis-over-neuralink-monkey-experiments) from a group that sued to get the records. It seems pretty bad, but that's pretty par for the course for early stage medical testing. Also, a lot of these early tests were done on monkeys that had other, unrelated, health problems too and probably weren't going to survive. It's really unfortunate, but there's probably no way to make medical progress, especially at the very early stage of testing, without some animals dying.

Here's [Neuralink's response](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/uc-davis-and-neuralink) to the records being released. And Neuralink has moved all their testing and animal care in house, and it seems like they're trying to set a [really high standard](https://neuralink.com/blog/husbandry/) for animal care and testing. 

In particular it seems like they're really going to great lengths to make sure that the animals only do testing if they want to. Obviously the animals can't consent to having the chips put in, or having any kind of medical care done. But they're not restrained or forced to take part in the tests. Like, [this pig](https://youtu.be/YreDYmXTYi4?t=6646) has a chip in its spinal cord, but they'll only test it while it's in that blue square on the ground. If the pig doesn't want to do the test anymore, it can leave. And obviously they're feeding it to encourage it to be there, but it seems like the big is more than happy to get some treats in exchange for having it's leg moved.

They do a similar thing with [charging](https://youtu.be/YreDYmXTYi4?t=3815). They use wireless charging to recharge the implant, and they placed the charging pad in a fake branch above a tube where the monkeys can get banana smoothies. So the monkeys will want to go up and put their head in the right position to get charged and get a treat.

It would be great if we treated all animals for any kind of testing with a lot more kindness. Especially when dealing with primates, it probably makes sense to err on the side of going slow and being cautious and thinking about them like little humans. But we also have a giant, global, [industrialized torture machine](https://youtu.be/k56NBsZXjr8) for factory farming. So in the list of horrible things humans do to animals, I don't think testing medical devices falls very high on the list.


Science cannot move forward without heaps!


Reason why I won’t buy a Tesla


> In this case, the cost of many monkey lives will likely save hundreds of thousands more humans

I fail to see how telepathic typing will save human lives tbh.


More likely it’ll just make someone rich.


You should think about volunteering as a human subject


what makes a monkey’s life more important than a human’s? objectively speaking, i mean. i’m pretty sure monkeys value their own lives more than humans ones as well


Does anyone want that?


There's something they don't understand. I don't have the power because I have the monkeys, i have the power because I'll let the monkeys out!


They're called full self driving monkeys and they're perfectly safe.


Isn't that just what we are?


Isn’t that basically Twitter right now? As long as they are right wing cyber monkeys of course.


So the people that are completely paralyzed for the remainder of their lives, we shouldn't give them this option?


Brains aren't magic. We may not know everything about them but we know that they won't spontaneously combust.


you* do not understand brains enough to make this a safe thing for literally anyone. 

thankfully that’s why we have people who have dedicated their lives researching brains helping create it. And not people like you


Are you anti vax? Because it seems like you're working on that level of competency.


How do you think we advance? I also think you vastly underestimate the R/D arm of the medical industry

*in Elon time.


I mean, if I was completely paralyzed with no chance of recovery or ability to use a computer or really interact with the outside world for the remainder of my life, I'd probably be interested in taking the risk.


Yeah sure. Right after Tesla releases full self driving and SpaceX has a fleet of Starships sending colonists to Mars.

At this point, given how deceptive the video is, and Musk's long track of not delivering on promises, I'm inclined to believe they may indeed be using an eyetracker after all. Why using the juice nozzle otherwise?


if the monkey is typing, then not only does it know English language but also can spell words? that seems like the obvious conclusion. 

i don't trust this. like its far easier to just enter words from another wireless keyboard than to teach English to a monkey, no matter how powerful a chip is embedded in their brain. 

Further, it implies the possibility of a Chomskian Universal grammar in a monkey and not only that but also that they managed to get that out of the monkey. I smell a rat. An exceptionally large rat.


Can you explain how this is fundamentally different than Nicolelis's work published in 2008?


That and rich parents.


This is the cutting edge. Duke had monkeys doing this a while back, Neuralink's interface is basically the same thing but with more electrodes and electrode density. Presumably this makes it more accurate.


Fair enough


Not much different from drugs such as HIV medication them? Pay thousands a year or die.


"You can finally communicate with the outside world instead of being locked inside your own mind to die in the wasting agony of conscious solitude. Now pay $8 or we'll make you a potato again."


While most of the stuff they’ve done so far has already been done, what is supposed to be unique about Neuralink right now iirc is the ease of implantation, and the (hopefully) lower cost. Also, a lot of the alternatives are much larger or invasive from what I’ve seen. Even if it never advances much from here, a wireless, inconspicuous, and relatively inexpensive implant would be great for allowing paralyzed people to more easily communicate and use computers.


He may be a wiener, but Falcon 9 seems to work, and the cars are good.

Whenever you get hungry the brainchip just repeats WENDY'S over and over


There has to be laws passed that implants and any protocols and peripherals they use are open sourced.

Congress is so out of touch with digital ethics. I mean they barely understand the internet and that's been around since the 80's.


15 out of 23. So closer to 70% https://www.google.com/amp/s/consequence.net/2022/02/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-chips-monkeys-died/amp/


Tesla - Shitty electric cars that spontaneously catch fire and STILL lack the promised competent self-driving

Starlink - Shitty satellite internet that's less than half of the coverage and speeds he promised, also less affordable than other satellite internet providers

SpaceX - Literally just doing things that NASA did back in the 70's & 80's, but with a higher failure rate this time

How is any of this revolutionary???


Can it teally do that? Or will be able to do that in like 100 years


I'm not saying that, if someone else did this same research, but ethically, it would be bad. I'm saying that Neuralink took shortcuts that others wouldn't (or couldn't, because they are illegal), just so they could rush their results. I'm complaining about Neuralink, and Elongated Tusk, not the idea of doing animal research. 

But someone with a fragile little man child brain wouldn't understand the distinction.


Sounds like someone’s got a case of the Mondays!


Altered Carbon or The Expanse. Both are pretty fucked


Especially the parts where it sucks every cent out of the poor, and gives them the barest minimum.


Is it really you? Or are you just making a copy of yourself and just killing your real self?


I see us heading towards autonomous' version of the future. A world controlled by big pharma.

My best friend suffers from locked in syndrome that is a consequence of going into diabetic keto acidosis, not being taken to the hospital by the idiots she was hanging out with because they thought they would get in trouble since she may have had drugs in her system, they eventually dropped her off on the ground in front of a local market. Her brain was without oxygen for 24 minutes. She had a heart attack and a stroke and went into a coma for months. When she awoke, her brain miraculously functioned such that she could think clearly but she realized with horror that she could not move anything. It would be six long months before she could finally move a toe. She has improved some but she is losing hope that she’ll ever recover fully. I would give anything for a device that could help her regain motor function and especially that could help her speech. She struggles so hard to speak. She is 34 years old. I will be her guardian when her mother passes. I think I will apply at Neuralink.

Hmmm…Cybermen….they’re like those green Star Trek robots that convinced Picard to join them at the battle of Wolf 359 right?


PAIN. PAIN. PAIN.


Love that bit in the episode (or the setup episode) when The Doctor steals Davros' chair and is talking to the Daleks whilst sipping on a cup of tea.


Jamie, pull that up


Don’t read about the real life incidents then. They are capable of literally ripping your face off. Honestly I’d rather something rip my jugular than deconstruct my face.


“a scene” bro it’s like 15 mins of the movie 😂

Ooo


Is that why Curious George always stayed young?


Ripperdoc gotta make a living choom


Even speaking commercially as a product if the electrodes don't have issues over time...who would want to have an iPhone 4s surgically implanted in their brain right now with the only way to upgrade being more neurosurgery?


Where can I read about this?


These numbers are skewed high because the researchers used the wrong kind of adhesive for the implant.


Euthanizing the animals for study is not NEARLY the same as dying during the study or because of it. Holy fucking shit.


It's nice that you justified the animals deaths, but please don't ignore the elephant in the room: they died from the implant, not from the study design.


It's not about them dying at any point afterwards, they died because of the chips.


There’s also animals for food


I culled like 15 chickens last night for their limbs.


With that logic we can go ahead and assign 100% death rates to all our mouse and rat studies as we have to take down the animals to study effects on organs... Just silly. That said, these animals died not specifically from the implant but from the fact that the dumbass researchers used the wrong kind of adhesive to attach the implant. What they used was toxic to the brain tissue and definitely not allowed. They didn't follow their approved protocol, it was a serious fuck up.


Yeah. Memes getting used as memetic viruses. Nominative determinism at its best.


So like, a Frunk Monkey?!


YES!!!!!!!


Wait did wolverine steal the car for his family?


I was thinking like the episode with the robot bees killing people.  lol.


And what do you think happened to the others?

There is no retirement home for no-longer-useful lab animals, AFAIK.


Reddit mods.


*With* the implants, not from. It's like saying that bears air force used to test ejection seats died from being ejected instead of being killed and dissected after landing.


A thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters. It's the blurst of times.


I read about 25% of test subjects die. There was an incident of one monkey missing fingers and toes—self inflicted. He claims they’re ready for human trails. Like, what bruh?


Elon knows neuralink has a preset kill limit


Science can't move forward without heaps!

From the sound of it, a majority of them were euthanized because they were slowly dying of reoccurring infections. :|


Euthanize euphemisms


A lot of time in animal research the word sacrifice is chosen instead


Err what? Euthanization is not only the correct term, but the industry term. Of course it's done out of mercy.


In animal studies, we often say “sacrificed” which is commonly shortened to “sacked.”


So neuralink says neuralink is treating animals with the utmost care. Have any other sources (that are actually objective and not just PR from the company) investigated?

Edit: LOL I got blocked by the guy above with all the awards touting neuralink as an ethical incredible company… all because I said I think they need other objective entities to investigate rather than neuralink saying “trust us”.

Yeah… he gives one guy a hard time for being a musk ‘hater’ while blocking other peoples comments that are neutral and just wanting what’s best for the monkeys.


That all seems good, but is there a source that doesn't have a vested interest in its perception?

&#x200B;

edit:

/u/Princess_and_a_wench I got blocked too. weird hill to die on


Factory farming is an atrocity.


So they refuse to give a number on how many different monkeys they've already tested and killed. 

Their "high standards" for animals basically include "clean water, food, shelter, comfy temperatures, possibility to rest and ask for enrichment, which also includes training" LMAO. sorry, these standards are basic and leave a great room for interpretation. Also interesting that they showed no real images of their monkey space.

And don't even bother with the consent argument. That is ridiculous on so many levels. They either go there and get food or do not go there and get no food. Well of course they go for the training. The ethically critical part is when they get implanted a chip that will eventually cause them to die a slow and by the sounds painful death. 

Neuralink is too "innovative". I'm sorry, but it is. We don't understand half our brain the way it is but some big head wants to put a fucking chip in it and test around. Yh, we will get much faster results this way, no doubt. But remember, that was the same argument the Nazis used in the concentration camps. Animals are dying and people will die because you're willing to throw away ethics in the name of technological advances. Whilst Neuralink can have medical uses, I very much doubt it's Musk's No. 1 goal. What a society we live in.

That was my rant, thanks for reading.


You mustve goven urself those awards lmao


You might get downvoted but I think this is a reasonably well thought out post. Positions on Animal testing has swung both ways in the pendulum but it feels like this one may not be at the ends


Woah, a cited researched post on a musk thread? Is this Reddit?


Neuralink purpose is disguised as helpful only to get their foot in the door and gain acceptance. They're using fighting medical conditions as a vehicle to allow these barbaric experiments. Their true aim, which is on brand for Elon, is pure novelty. Plus the ability to "download and upload thoughts" This is Orwellian as fuck. They want to read your mind and be able to force thoughts into your head. This is what these monkeys are being tortured for. They don't give a fuck about the lives of these animals.


Well they treat them better than teslas treat toddlers on the street


I used to work in both clinical and non-clinical research. That entire press release is bullshit from Tesla. IACUC rules on primates are incredibly strict, and mass maiming/death being "par for the course" is the exact opposite of what occurs. The fact that went in house is actually damning, because there's less oversight of their work after clear violations of animal rights. 

Under no circumstances should we trust anything Musk or Neurolink staff have to say on they matter unless we see all the official documentation from the federal government on safety protocols and consistent auditing of both studies and labs.


Bleep Bloop Elon simp detected!


Save? No. 

But for people with locked in syndrome, it could allow them to have a voice again, and express their wishes


I think you should look beyond the initial technical capabilities then.


While it likely won’t directly save any lives, it can drastically improve the quality of life for many, such as paralyzed people, people with locked-in syndrome, people with ALS, people with severe motor function disorders that make them unable to operate computers, etc.


Then your worldview is narrow and insular.  Learn.


Think of people with severe disabilities and degenerative issues like ALS. BCI implants allowing the to communicate in real-time or control artificial limbs would be life changing.


You should watch the presentation, it will answer all your questions.


Indoor plumbing for one


Monkeys cannot sue so they are valued less. If you want to end animal cruelty give an agency the power to sue people over their treatment.


To be fair, it would be funny at first.


Dunno, but just remember one thing, everyone knows what musk wants, thinks, and eats.

_I've never seen so many experts in one place._


it might be worth the risk in that case but their point still stands, in that it would not be safe.


Oh? Go volunteer then. Enjoy your lifetime of pain and suffering for your billionaire conman god. Sacrifice yourself


There is literally no way to test things like this on animals. They do invasive procedures that fail until they work. As far as I know you also can't do these kinds of tests, calibrations and surgeries without the subject being concious, restrained and with an open skull.

Not to mention all these wild animals are held in very sad conditions for a wild animal.

This is from their site:

"six animals were euthanized at the medical advice of the veterinary staff at UC Davis. These reasons included one surgical complication involving the use of the FDA-approved product (BioGlue), one device failure, and four suspected device-associated infections"


Damn, that's never then.


The video isn’t deceptive at all, it’s the layperson’s misunderstanding of what’s happening, and then relaying that bad information that’s deceptive. 

I watched this presentation live, and they were 100% clear that the monkey wasn’t choosing the letters, they are simply choosing the yellow/highlighted box for a reward. 

This is now the 4th post on social media I’ve seen claim that “the monkey is typing”, though.


How is the video deceptive? He clearly states right away that the monkey is directing the cursor towards a handler *highlighted* letter and not actually choosing letters to direct it towards on his own initiative (which is obvious to anyone as macaques can not write English/spell).


It did kinda look in the Pong video that the monkey was moving its hand in the same direction that its paddle was moving. But hopefully I'm just seeing things. I really want neuralink (or any other brain-computer interface technology) to succeed.


The monkey doesn’t know English. All that the demo is showing is that the monkey can control a cursor with enough accuracy and precision that it would be capable of using a keyboard to communicate if it were intellectually capable of doing so.


> then not only does it know English language but also can spell words? that seems like the obvious conclusion. 

Or just watch the actual keynote where they literally say it's rewarded for pointing the cursor to the bright words.

It's purposefully displayed as a keyboard here because that's the human application.


The BCI is compact and not visible. Neuralink intends to get human trials ASAP.


And that of course …


Yes, that is another huge problem with for profit medicine. Insulin and chemotherapy too.


Now that the initial hype has worn off, there's a lot of disagreement about whether the cars are good.  But that's mostly irrelevant, as he neither started Tesla nor engineered the cars.  Similarly, Space X functions on the work of the real engineers that are employed, and any success is in spite of Musk's antics, not because of it; though his past misadventures did generate the necessary funding.  The problem with trusting Musk's words on these projects is that he has so little understanding of the depth of the projects that he's only going to communicate a highly doctored and off-base version of the facts; and that's without even considering intentional PR to inflate his ego and worth.  As an example, consider that he promised the (figurative) moon for both the hyperloop and SpaceX.  One of these is totally feasible under the current understanding of science; and one is so far out of the scope of current science so as to be ridiculous.  But Elon's own understanding doesn't go deep enough to understand things like this; and every time he's asked a "hard" question like how the fundamental issues are actually solved, he dodges the question.  Not gonna trust his word at all with neuralink.


"they aren't perfect therefore they didn't do anything at all!" What a shitty argument, feel ashamed of yourself. I know lots of people personally who thank God for Starlink, for example. Sure it might not deliver at the exact levels advertised (just like literally every other ISP on the market) but it is revolutionary in that a lot of people who had zero access to reasonable internet now have it.

Your throbbing hate boner for Elon, regardless of whether it's justified, has robbed you of any objectivity.


Eh space x have reusable rockets. 

All these companies have created things but elon wasn't a vital part of those inventions etc.


Well this puts us on track to getting there. This is actually a pretty cool field of tech and it’s great they are exploring it. It sucks musk is so invested in the **legitimately cool forefront of tech** and everything he actually touches in his companies is absolute shit, I mean he isn’t a coder or an inventor he’s just a asshole with apartheid money. But that doesn’t mean some of the things his companies do aren’t still pretty cool. Tesla was horrible from the get go, it’s basically only done damage to the EV movement, and that’s because of the few decisions musk pushed (exclusive charging, doors that only work in the right conditions, subscription services, false promises, expensive yet useless features, a really dumb breaking system that throws “intuitive” out the window).

Neuralink is complicated and technical enough that, like spaceX, it’s hard for musk to actually do anything to fuck it up. Although he has tried his damndest to put his mark on spaceX so we will see where this goes for neuralink.


I believe you get your ass kick for saying something like that man.


Or the Monkays


Por que no dos?


That is the near future dystopia we’re facing but once we really start combining our biology with technology we’ll transcend humanity and become something different. The ultra rich cyborgs won’t need poor people when they have AI and robots at their every command. 

Of course we have to avoid blowing ourselves up entirely in the coming climate wars for them to make it that far. An essential collapse of society is the only hope poor people have for any kind of bright future with our current trajectory.


Haha that’s what the book series explores wish the show got into it more. Unfortunately that’s why it got canceled they didn’t really explain that part of it when they switched actors and it just felt like a gimmick. It’s the next level of nature vs nurture. What is “you?”


Check out The Drum Thing and Garbage Time on YouTube as well. Those are his drum and car channels respectively.

I still remember a time when “one of the world’s largest corporations would like to install microphones in your home to listen to your pattern of life and recommend relevant products” was enough to convince the lay person that technology could go too far, but now people pay for the privilege. I look forward to the first time I climax looking at an advertisement for Pizza Hut’s new double stuffed crust pizza. Well, the first time my implant does it for me at least

Okay but yeah you get me!


Put this spine in me now!


They talked about that.

The plan is to make the device (minus the threads) removable with minimal effort.


The proper way is not to implant the device itself, but just part that allows the device to connect.


I don't know about reading, but here's a YouTube video by Common Sense Sceptic.

I'm going to caveat this by telling you these guys have a hard time doing anything BUT debunk Musk and his terrible behaviour and bullshit, I wish they'd branch out, but this will give you the info you need about neuralink.


That Frunky Monkey!


If I remember correctly Wolverine stole Fury’s car to get somewhere and he knew where it was kept. I just can’t remember exactly what issue it was in.

Edit. It was Age Of Ultron I just can’t remember the number issue in the series.


Well considering he said 15% *survived*, I'm gonna assume they're in a dumpster.


Yes there is. I used to live by one in Louisiana.


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=no_elVGGgW8


He's also said "self driving cars by the end of this year" for the past 6 years.........you really want to trust him to put an implant in your brain?


Depends on how much you care about humans I guess.


“Bobo type by thinking now. Why Bobo need fingers?”


Let all the Elon simps sign up.  Elon gets his Borg army, and the world gets significantly fewer Elon simps.  Win win!


So we're clear, neuralink doesn't decide this, the government regulatory body does


In every experiment ever 100% of subjects will eventually die


It’s 25% but im too lazy to do the legwork.


If 100% died they wouldn’t still be doing it


Yeah that’s the main problem, a chip is always going to have those problems, they need to make a non invasive interface


I still feel like euthanized isn't the right word for it.


I see "destroyed" quite often as well


That does seem like a more  appropriate word.


Exactly. They moved it in house for the control. 
I’m sure everyone on this project has signed a non disclosure agreement. 
If it is really more ethical it would have open to the public tours to show people how cool this technology is 
Reality is no one wants to se sausage being made

That's... That's why they start with animal trials. You know, like any other new drug or medical device. The thing that this thread is about


Honestly the thing that would keep me from trying this is the hatred for the concept of post-humanism. The prospect of it killing me isn't a potential drawback as much as a potential positive.


...did you see the monkey is actually typing shit? How is it a con?


You agreed that this procedure killed thousands of monkeys and added they "tortured" them.

If they video isn't deceptive, the intent of it is. Relying on, and exploiting people's ignorance is what I'm referring to. 

I didn't say the monkey was typing. I know they can't. You may have seen other comments claiming this. Precisely because the video is deceptive. But yeah, I think this is as far as you and I exchange graphemes.


Reddit has really, really given me a new appreciation for just what science has achieved over the centuries. The constant barrage of either ignorance, small-mindedness or pettiness. It's like watching a child trying to force their way through a crowd of millions of bitter and resentful adults

Yeah, which is exactly why every single person who is handwringing about musk's involvement comes across as an idiot. Yeah you shouldn't trust what musk has to say. You shouldn't care about what he has to say either way, because in the end he's basically just the finance guy. So the people who are like *oh no! Elon is involved?! Well it must be a scam!" sound super silly.


Thanks, I hope they come to some breakthroughs and help people.


If you had a million dollars what would you do?


Eh, I see us jumping straight to digitized consciousness and robot bodies before we ever really get rolling on cyborg body modification. Immune systems don’t play well enough with foreign objects.


AI Armageddon is a much more likely extinction event then nukes or climate change. Merging is probably our only chance of survival and at that point do we even retain our individualism or enter a hive mind of hyper efficient productivity as we inch toward becoming a type 1 civ.

You don't have to wait for a brain chip to do this.


Locust of Bebbanburg


Well, as long as it's not Elon himself, he doesn't care at all about anyone else ...


r/technicallythetruth


Well they would, idea being to continue until eventually maybe some don't die.


Eh, chips have been implanted in humans before, actually quite successfully. We have been doing it for decades actually, the problem with brain chips is often scarring.

As for implanting chips causing infections... Yeah, there is a possibility of that. But we have been dealing with that shit for literally decades. There actually were people who had plutonium powered chips implanted in them (pacemakers), lived for decades with them and died of old age.

EDIT: actually of we wanted we could reduce possibility of infection to zero. Before antibiotics were invented, during surgery (think amputation of leg) whole room had to be disinfected to reduce possibility of infection to zero. So it's not *that* difficult, it just needs a ton of preparation.


That's fair


No he listed one example. Meaning there would be other examples that encompass more.


Who said thousands? Nobody in this thread said thousands. Neuralink has only tested on a two dozen monkeys as it is, although their fatality rate is apparently relatively high. I've seen some references of 15 out of 23, but I haven't dug deep enough to find where that number comes from. 

There is an [ongoing lawsuit by an animal rights group](https://www.businessinsider.com/uc-davis-sued-pictures-elon-musk-neuralink-animal-tests-monkeys-2022-9) that alleges animal abuse based on [documents they received and ~370 photos that UC Davis refuses to release.](https://www.abc7news.com/elon-musk-neuralink-monkeys-brain-chip-monkey-death/11581014/)


I did. That's torture. You're welcome. You can also google for more information, for example:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-cruelty-allegations

Your welcome again.


They are showing what the device will be capable of. If it can do this typing routine on a monkey, without eye tracking, then a human will be able to do the same. If somebody can’t control their body, they would really appreciate a way to communicate with only using their thoughts.


Agreed! My hope is that space exploration and neuro-tech continue to grow, hopefully musk fucks up enough that he gets removed from the picture at some point. If these companies fall that’s totally fine too, as long as people don’t develop negative stigma towards the actual science. It’s musk that sucks, not EVs, neuro-tech, or space exploration. I don’t trust his companies but we should avoid developing a stigma against valuable scientific fields just because it was funded by an asshole.


2 chicks at the same time man!


But is that REALLY you. Or a copy of you.


Really? I see there being way more moral/ethical/philosophical/religious dilemmas from digital consciousness, also seems like cybernetics are much closer than human ai conversion.


Um, ok, but remember, you'll have the strength of five gorillas.


Ah, sorry, I was tired when I wrote that. What I meant to say was they wouldn’t keep showing it off if it was 100% fatal tests. They’d probably work to get those numbers down a bit before holding a press conference and announcing upcoming human trial.


The user I'm talking to 'LadyFarretQuenn' she deleted the 'thousands' remark and is constantly editing her comment without a disclaimer. 🤷‍♂️


>I did. That's torture. You're welcome.

Let's get one thing straight. It should be common place to provide a source to a big accusation such as this, so you're 'welcome' for the guidance I have provided. 

Dozens is not "thousands" could you please provide a source for your claims of Neurolink killing thousands of monkeys. Thank you.


But you're only 5 feet tall


Ah yes, you're right.


Im tired of people saying demos are op etc, people don’t realise how hard it is to get good demos.


if someone tells you "youre bad so you use demos" just tell them "youre dumb so you use mechanics"


OK Comm


In higher elos, anyone complaining about game mechanics is silly imo. I can see how casual players may consider it anti-fun though. People who aggressively demo newer players in lower elos may negatively impact their experience.

"I was just trying to hit the ball and they demo'd me 3 times in a row!"

That's not fun, and they may feel they're being targeted.

I should never hear that from a competitive player.


>A common situation for 1v1


> "Reddit, I have an Announcement to make"


It has been ~~1~~ 0 day(s) since the last "demos aren't bad" post


People can get really mad over demos. I don't get it tho. Im doing them a service. Free boost and rotation for them. Right?


Ok, we get it. I agree. Demos are part of the game and you shouldn’t get mad at them. But cmon, this is like the 100th post talking about the same thing. Honestly speaking, what do you get out of making a Reddit post telling a story of how someone got extremely mad at demos?


[deleted]


Confession time:  Sometimes I spam some quickchats after I get demoed just because I think it's funny or will cause my opponents to play more recklessly.


I’d rather demo someone than score a goal. “Demo Demon”


Just avoid it. There's a mechanic to cause and avoid demos lmao. It's funny that lower ranked players take it so much better than higher ranked ones. Demos are super important in matches


Games are easier to win from 3-0 down. The moment me and my team mate are 3 down we’re like “right where we want em” then comeback hard


I see more posts complaining about people who complain about demos, than I've heard people complain about demos.


You can report people for complaining about demos. If they get enough complaints about their complaining, Psyonix gives them a title they can't change that reads "Demolished and Entitled AF."


I dont care if you demo me i only get triggerd if you keep demoing me and or chasibg demoes like there is no tomorrow. Just play the game, ah a demo opportunity sure take it but dont ignore plays to get a demo ...


What an original post.


Bro it's not news to anyone that demos are a valid game mechanic. But what people who make these (incredibly repetitive) posts never seem to realize is that in *any* game, there are going to be totally valid strats that some people find more annoying than others. That's just part of gaming. And having a negative emotional response to something you perceive as annoying is totally normal and just part of the human experience. 

imo being annoyed about demos is just as valid as using demos *so long as you're not calling for demos to be removed from the game.* 

To be totally honest, what's more childish than reacting negatively to demos is going online and making this pretentious post telling people to grow up.


His fault for not being prepared for it.


Let them cry. That only makes it better and only makes me want to do it more.


I'll demo you out the air. Fuck your air dribble.


Yeah it's an extension of car control, game state, and spatial awareness it's a great mechanic.


Demos rock


It’s the same kind of people that bitch about grenade/sniper/rocket/jump&crouch users in fps. And people hate it so much because the only answer they get, and even can get for these situations, is git gud or ff


OH LOOK! The one millionth time this same thing has been posted congratulations\~!


If you demo me while in the play, a good position, or rotating rotating I’m gonna hate you. If you drive to demo me across the field and get scored on cuz you’re out of position I’m gonna think you’re a loser. On a serious note I swear demos are more broken lately, I’ve had a number of times where I t bone someone and I blow up.


If you get demo'ed then it is a a lack of situational awareness. People don't realize that you need to keep track of the ball, your teammates AND the opposing team. If you get mad you got demo'ed then stop staring at the ball so hard and maybe do better at keeping your speed.


Love a good demo.


Unpopular take, demos shouldn't exist. It's an aspect of the game that doesn't fit and it's unnecessary.

What I mean is, you have a sports game meshed with cars. Why are demos even a thing? Bumping, yes, but destroying another car is a gimmick. 

Always felt like trolls used demoing to put the other team on tilt. It's simply a way for less skilled players to contribute.


I love to read it.  I once was demo'ing some dude in my silver days and he started ranting in the chat how I have no skill.  As soon as he sent it I went down and scored it on him.


Idk. Sounds like the opponent was also just using in game chat and mechanics to play the game as well.


That's just 1s tho.  I found this really fun setting called turning off chat lol


If you can make calculated demo plays, i fully respect it. But if you’re playing duos or standard and just chase people around to clear the net, it’s not as respectable.


Not a person being a baby about getting demoed but I had a teammate who saw myself and other people bumping and demolishing and they said to play normal. I explained to them it’s a normal and okay thing to do. Demo’s aren’t just difficult to do as well, there’s a right and wrong time to do it. A good bump or a good demo is very tactical in nature. It’s part of the game and everyone can do it. Because of this, I turn people’s complaint back at them and ask why they don’t try and go for demolitions sometimes.


The thing that always cracks me up (as someone who basically only demo chases in casual lobbies), is the fact that there are plenty of people who i've encountered in games, especially ranked ones, who will genuinely, and wholeheartedly *apologize* for demoing me. I initially thought it was them trying to rub it in my face a little (because I'll admit i do that when i get people tilted sometimes, its funny), but there has been an overwhelming amount of people that i have seen who go out of their way to *avoid demoing people*. And who apologize when they do. Like its some morally wrong thing to do. I dont get it but its really really funny.


I agree that demos are a viable and skillful strategy in Rocket League, but I’m still going to be pissed if you demo me…


I don’t mind a good demo, but a really shitty one annoys me not gonna lie. If you go out of your way to chase me down and then you get scored on because of that, I’m judging you hard because you look stupid. Any other time I might be butthurt but that’s free game and a good demo


The only unfair part of a demo is when someone else gets demo and I can't fucking see because of the smoke


I respectfully decline your offer and will instead stay mad. Thank you.


They keep demoing me, so I keep telling them which unholly things I did to their mothers. Playing on a keyboard is awesome for communication.


No one has any problem with tactical demos, it’s the toxic and unnecessary demos that make the game annoying.


I can agree In general but demo heavy teams are super annoying imo. especially in casual. I always say nice bump when it's deserved but when every goal is a demo goal because that's all they do it can get super old.


I get it, but the tactic that some players have to constantly go for demos is rather annoying. Most of the time it doesn’t work out in their favor and it costs the game for their team.


If you dont like the mechanics of a game your playing then you shouodnt be playing that game.
People are just whinny now days. 
I bump people and demo and always get the same reactions. Its actually comical how serious some people take this game. It. Is. A . Game


Yes demos are a part of the game, but toxic guy has a point. Leaning on demos because of trash mechanics is weak ASF. It's literally saying I don't care about improving, I'm just going to be annoying on purpose. Demos are definitely a skill on their own but using it in an unnecessary situation or excessively just makes you worse at the game.

That being said, 1 strategic demo is a smart play, and him tilting himself is 100% his fault. I agree, the mentality should be about enjoying the game and improving, and I think most of the player Base has this energy. But also, we literally play with children. So we take the good with the bad. His attitude will be his own detriment.


Forfeiting is also a part of the game and people should stop pretending just throwing a ff vote is toxic. Unless you start griefing it isn't


My only problem with demos are how unreliable they can be. I can't tell you how many times I've avoided a demo, say by jumping or turning a specific direction to avoid it, for my opponents latency to forgive them and give them the demo. I've literally tboned am opponent and *I* was blown up instead because of the latency correction.  

Otherwise, it's 100% valid to do so in the game.


Scoring is a viable mechanic and people get salty when they get scored on. Whiners will always whine when they lose. 

"Lol, why are you trying so hard"
"You can only demo"
"I'm actually high ranked and you suck"


Is it toxic to say "Wow!"? I thought that was like a rule 1 or something to say that lol


Viable game mechanics can still be annoying. Not defending this random kid's reaction but everyone who's sunk time into this game gets annoyed at them from time to time because of how OP they are.


Your opponent was probably 12


Turn your chat off. You don’t see any of the bitching about demos, bumps, or “calculated” goals.


Thank you!


That’s the exact situation I have “This is Rocket League!” for


I don’t like when people demo when you are down 3 v 2 or 3 v 1. It’s not deMo time it’s time to try crazy shots and saves


They sure are viable. Just ask our boy u/bumpotheclown    (Also wats up bumpo sephiroth here xd)


There’s nothing better than demoing someone who gets pissed, then they spend the rest of the game trying to demo you back and ignoring the ball only to have them get scored on even more. 

Let them freak out and then suggest maybe they should write to Psyconix or just get better.


Watching a replay isn’t toxic.


I just hate when people chase demos in casual, please :( it’s not that deep, like do them they’re a part of the game, but if you’re running a demo strat to grind casual that’s just a lil weird I feel like. Personal opinion, demos have every right as a game mechanic otherwise


People have been complaining for 7 years. 

I fully look forward to them complaining for another 7.


[deleted]


WOW!


Demoing is harder than hitting the ball lol. The ball isn't conscious, won't escape from you. Dodging a demo is usually clicking just 2 random buttons one including jump, but people still think that they are "better" because all they do is sweat their balls off trying to beat their opponent to the ball. That's bullshit lol I WILL demo you if you stand there like a scarecrow and I won't regret it for a milisecond.


I have a record of 28 demos in one game 3v3 ranked. My team name is Demo.


I said it before and I will say it again:

&nbsp;

1-2 tactically executed demos during match = completely fine

Chasing demos anytime you can to prevent opponents to mount an effective counter-attack = you are an idiot that does not know how to play any other way.

&nbsp;

Change my mind.


It's like kicking a guy in the nuts. Only if completely necessary. If you spam it and its your 'playstyle' it's incredibly obnoxious. You lose any bragging rights for winning the game and I will make fun of you for not being a higher rank despite using scummy tactics.


Ok.


But…but with every excuse taken away from me for losing, the closer I get to having to admit that I’m really just not that good!


can we stop having this thread every 30 minutes?


Theres a time and place to use a demo. Sometimes its just unsportsmanlike to demo for no reason


It can get annoying, we can agree on that right


I screenshotted this and sent this to my duo and his response was, “Bitch the people are going for the ball they not paying attention to kissing the other car”. 

I’m the teammate who can get 4 demos in 30 seconds if I wanted and then for the remainder of the game he’s driving to save himself. Something he always says “bro don’t demo cause for some fucking reason they go for me” >:)


Don't blame someone for having an emotional reaction to you demoing them. You won, congrats.

Oh wait this is Reddit and we're all emotionless logic factories.


Facts!

People forget where this game came from before being rocket league.

I go out if my way to demo them when they become little bitches.
Demo is a tactic. If you cry about being demod it means you're not good enough or observant enough to avoid it.


Love this! Thank you 🙏🏼. 

The flip side is appreciating when people lay down a good on demo you (which I have had people comment “nice demo!”  and I have commented in game) and controlling your mechanics in ways that make you harder to demo.


I hope people stay mad about demos because that tilt is the only way I can compete at the ranks I'm in lol


Everytime i can get a demo without it being too much of a risk for my team then i would go for it, the explosion followed by the tilt from the kids or a goal with it is like an addiction


Nice Demo!


bro i'll have 7 goals and then the opponent tries to demo me for a goal or two to catch up. It's a fair method, but I think your opponent was really tilted after a losing streak

I'd wager money that this is either Plat or Champ

oops didn't see the user flair


As some one who has played the game constantly since launch and has been in the reddit community and otherwise for a while. People are never going to change their minds. No matter what, people will always cry about demos.


Who the hell cares if someone thinks demos are “noob” or whatever. Their just not good enough to dodge.


Truth.  Preach brother.  If it wasn't part of the game, then why is it part of the game?


Facts


Yes and yes


Absolutly, im an absolute trash at the game, but actally good at demos, so I use it at my advantage. It dosent work all the time but it took me out of trouble many times.


If that's all it takes, demo from the beginning.


I love it when people get mad. That means they’re thinking about me and their attention is divided.


Okay.


I would love a competitive mode where there are no demos, only bumps.


I hate people who solely go for demos. It kinda makes it unfun


but abusing it is just toxic , if you cant win a game without demo you are not in a rank you deserve to be


Complaining about demos is a viable complaint and people need to stop being babies when they hear it.


Demo's have their place in the game. It's the players that only demo in 1s that grind my gears. It's the reason I no longer accept 1v1 challenges. If you want to prove that you're better, be better. My 6 year old knows how to demo.


I'm not even sure why this topic needs to be discussed...


If you complain about demos you have mental health problems and should go to therapy


oh its this post again


Fuck demos and people that do them on purpose.


Another week, another post whining about people whining about demos


They need to get nerfed. Not because they are too hard to avoid but because the whole community base their playstyle around demo. This game could be called demo league.

In gc lobbies demos are fine because people use them alot but not overuse them because they kinda know when a demo is too risky. In casual and lower ranks people do nothing but demo demo demo. They don't even care if they lose they miss a demo turn around and try it 3 times more. It's just not fun playing and constantly having to think about the next demo.

It should take a good amount of skill to get a demo like only if you hit certain points on a car you get a demo so people stop going for demos NONSTOP.


If you need to demo in a 1v1 you are indeed bad. You are getting rid of the only player on the field in order to score so


The game is 10 yrs old. Why does this still get talked about?


Demos are a part of the game. With that being said, they are just a crutch for bad players. My friend hasn't played a game of rocket league without getting demo'd in more than a year.


everyone says that this is the millionth time this has been posted but for me its the first time. So uh just know that


What rank are you in?  I find that everybody below diamond are of the mindset that blowing up players is a dick move.  In diamond, that mindset shifts quickly.


Anyone with simple sports sense likely won’t get demo’d as often. It’s simple positioning. When the ball in in the corner and someone sets up on the point. You better believe you’re getting bumped or demo’d.  You don’t deserve a free shot on goal. If I’m back checking 100% you’re dust for being there.  It’s happened to me too I forget I’m a sitting duck.  That’s why you should sit or zag to the point and curl in. And a strategic demo the goalie to possibly open the net is free game too. That puts that player out of potion for a rebound if the goalie can dodge the demo.  

Anyways. Turn chat off and just play. Games are immensely better. Zero tilt.


Demos will not be fun if no one cries about it.


Looking at you ttv_phii


If a mechanic is built as part of a game then it's game.

Those PC mod people can F off though


Had a 3s game yesterday and got called a “demo pussy” and I’m pretty damn sure I demoed them exactly once around 4 minutes into the game on a pure opportunity hit 🤷‍♂️. My reply anytime someone bitches about demos is always “Waaaahh.”


Demo meta is funny because as frustrating and as “cringe” it can seem to get demo’d, i started getting a lot more aware and a lot better at dodging demos, and it’s funny watching someone go out of their way to demo me only for them to not be able to touch me or get zero value out of it in general. It’s even better when it works against them and they throw themselves out of position and give me a free goal. Keep comin at me lil bros, y’all can’t touch me


I’m no demolition expert and tbh I haven’t played the game in months but I remember the fun I had dodging tilted opponent’s demo attempts


If I'm getting demoed because my team isn't countering quick enough, nothing I can do.  

If I'm getting demoed because of an opportunistic position, nothing I can do.  

If I'm getting demoed because an opponent is chasing out of position looking for demos, I thank them for giving us an opening every time their teammates can't get back quick enough to make up for that.


*Bumpo has entered the chat*


I will quadruple wow every time and I cannot be stopped


I love going into the limited mode on right now and going solely for demos. One match I had 34. When people complain about an occasional demo in ranked, I go for them more and I’m starting to get good at it lmao


RLCS right now: https://clips.twitch.tv/QuaintOriginalPepperoniVoteYea-DHZ4Dux_1cH-VEf1


You should've just been laughing maniacally going for extra demos then worrying about what some drunk or child crybaby said cause they got skillfully picked apart


Half the time when I’m trying to keep up with teammates I try to be useful with bumps or demos after I take my turn


Always respond with “This is Rocket League!” - can’t argue with that shit


No! Next!


Crazy this games been out for years and people who’ve played enough to reach Champ/GC still don’t understand reacting to demos is just gonna lead to you getting demoed more.


All of my friends get mad at someone that demo them and they just say it’s op and unfair and the guy has skill.

I always appreciate good demos. Of course I get mad at them, I get mad when I lose, but for me it’s hard to get good demo and these guys can make some insane ones. Demos are just a mechanic and pretty hard one to learn.


I love not intentionally demoing someone, but it just happens- and then the person spends the entire rest of the match trying to demo me on offense, on defense, doing anything


Savage!!!


It’s chess, not checkers. People think it’s soccar but you have to be able to setup your team mates with demos to open up those goals.


In 1s folks tilt because they can’t blame their teammates so instead of owning up to something they could’ve done better, they’ll blame you. Demos are a great strategy vs me letting you wait for 
that rebound and score on me. I’ll demo when it makes sense and I’m unapologetic for it.  

In casual I get why people might get more tilted if they are just trying to relax but that’s the best time for me to get my practice in on demos. I don’t have to worry about a tilted teammate in ranked if I mess up. If y’all can try to flip reset and dunk on me then I am going to demo- sorry not sorry. Extra points for the TTV going for highlights folks, I’ll make a point to demo you more the second that first “okay” comes out 

The only time I’m not a fan is when the score is out of hand, it’s a 1v2 (or 1v3) in ranked and demoing the lone person while they watch the replay too on top. You’ve already got the win, just run the clock out.


He didn't have insurance


Gonna be honest. I hate getting demode. 
Just like I hate getting smoked in Arma, or getting bumped in iRacing or getting quickscoped in Call of Duty back in the day. 
It makes it harder, and takes you out of the play or the action. But it's part of the game. If you take out demos, you might as well take out double jumping, oh and boost, oh and don't forget driving up the wall. 
I'm pretty sure FIFA releases a game every year. 

Yes, I get demoed.... a lot... but it makes me have situational awareness. 

But if you take it out. They'll just find something else to complain about. 
That's just the world we live in.


I always say Thanks! When someone demoes me. Keeps it light so we can both laugh about it


No! No! Don't listen to OP! Please throw a big hissy fit every time I demo you, please! It makes it so much more fun to bump you again! Plus the time you spend typing in chat and the energy you put into fuming about them makes my bumps even more effective.


I see this same post every 3 months


Honestly, I would have laughed my ass off at his raging. It's not that big of a deal. Cmon :)


V1 just beat nrg while comm had 20 demos in a rlcs semi finals. Its a valid strategy and people need to accept it


Nah let them keep complaining so we can feast on their tears.


One of the best parts of getting a demo is hearing the opposing team cry about it, and then doing it again.


If I have the ball and get demo'd - it's fine though I may IRL say WTF but if I don't have the ball - I will have my vengeance, in this game or the next


I demoed some French guy 5 times in one game and he said he was going to report me. I recorded this so my friends could see. Bahahaaaa pathetic.


Goons gunna goon


Will we ever stop seeing this exact same post once a week?


Disagree. People upset about demos makes the demo 100x more satisfying


I've never understood it. Like I get demoed. Damn. Keep going. Now if I start to feel like a guy is singling me out then sometimes I get carried away and hard demo back but usually try to make sure team is in a winning state before giving in to shenanigans.


It’s incredible that this game has been out for like 7 years and this is still something people complain about.


Okay.


dodging demos is so easy too in 1v1


No one said demos are inherently bad. Being a little shit and demo chasing is bad.


u/thesaucegodreborn get rekt


Found Comm's alt account


The game of rocket league has a flow and a rhythm and if in the midst of that you disrupt it, you are likely to get demoed. To complaim about demoes is to show that you have no awareweness/game sense.

If a half-assed shot from the opponent turns into a offensive transition, then the guy who took that shot might be rotating in your third looking for a demo.

If your team can't clear the ball and your getting pressured, maybe turn you ball cam off everyone once in awhile and take a look at the whole field.

Your on offense, your tm8 just took a shot, it was saved. If your sitting idle in the midfield looking for a pass. Maybe consider that the guy who just saved the ball might be headhunting to relieve pressure.

AWARENESS IS THE CURE TO ALL DEMOS, COMPLAINING WONT GET YOU ANYWHERE!


I game ultimately is very well balanced and it’s always usually up to a persons skill and or seriously bullshit luck I mean ‘Calculated’ suck my ass


But that's part of why they work so well


No shooter no shot.


Yes but if I look behind me and see you chasing me after you demo 17 times for random I’m gonna spam wow in the chat and then cuss you out


Easier to dodge demos than to get one.


Disable chat and I promise you’ll never have to confront another angry player again. Rocket League is so much more peaceful and fun without chat.


If I can’t setup for a ball again in time, you better be damn sure I’m smacking into your car instead


They are in the game so you can't complain if other people use it BUT demos don't bring anything fun into the game


3v3 camp in goal. You may get demo'd.


This game is full of babies i wish there was an option that let’s you somehow play with people your age.


Oh good, this again.   
How refreshing.


No i will not stop being a baby when getting repeatedly demoed, but that doesnt mean i dont think its a viable and skillful mechanic; im just releasing frustration


I’ve bound nice demo to quick chat now. It really seems to reverse the tilt.


Another great reason to switch off chat


“People need to stop being babies”

YOU ARE LITERALLY PLAYING KIDS (as in underage people) HALF OF THE TIME IN ROCKET LEAGUE.

People need to stop complaining about childish behaviour in RL because often it comes from ACTUAL CHILDS. How hard is that to accept and move on? Just play your game, try your mechanics.


Why do people get like this when demo'd. As a new player this is the funniest shit ever, if they complain. I just demo more 😂


>they can be used to be toxic

How? Even demo chasing you only put yourself at a disadvantage. The moment you see someone chasing you know that's all they're gonna do, and then it's easy to dodge them and they're out of position.

Anyone who can't handle demo chasing either refuses to adapt or just straight up sucks.


I Will 100% get downvoted but i don't care. The problem i have with demos Is not being able to choose where to spawn and inconsitencies with bad connection, because i touch the car in Supersonic and It doesn't give me the demo. Other than that, it's so good.


I agree. However, some people demo when you aren't even NEAR the ball.


When they spam that I just put nice demo. It's their own failult for not dodging it at the end of the day


My ideal Rocket League game and best show is when demos are not abused.

Yesterday I was playing 3vs3, after playing a overtime of over 5 minutes, the opponents started demoing everyone and won this way. It turned from a (amazing and exciting) game based on skills to a worse game imho.

To me, demos are ok when not abused, otherwise a game based on skills becomes a demolition game.

I'd prefer the option of turning demos off honestly.


When my buddies want me to play on their team I just ride around and demo the other team. Helps them score goals and I suck at the game so it’s entertaining. Win/win


I dont see demo as a toxic action, you demo me, my game goal is changed targetting you. Why do you find this toxic? for me, i wait for those opportunities because its fun and i laugh from it when i see the other guy try to jump as i come after him and my team scores because of that.


The thing is ... if the enemy team has one teammate whos sole purpose is going for demos ... never once touches the ball ... just hunting the other team

Yes, it's a valid strategy and yes that means they only have 2 people actually playing but ... it's still really annoying and takes the fun out of it ...

oh and to put all this into perspective - I'm talking about Casual 3v3 .. NOT ranked


90% of the demos I make are accidental, and I’ll normally use a ‘Sorry!’ emote immediately after. 

Still get people chasing a revenge demo for the rest of the match - so usually post up in goal and jump when they charge. 

I love for the seething of little piss babies.


Even looking at the player base for one single game (Rocket League here of course) you will find a complete cross section of humanity. 

You will find the people who will say nice one and congratulate you on a demo and play on.

You will find those that it annoys in such a way that it allows them to gain focus and improve their own game as a result.

But you will also find those that get so tilted they will react in a manner such as OP has reported.

And most importantly a single person can react in any of these ways on a given day at any given time.

Think of all the outside influences on humans, this opponent could have just had an argument with a partner or family member, they could have lost a job, they could have had some devastating personal news, they could have just had a game where the opponent just went for demos the whole game. 

Or they could just REALLY hate the demos in the game...

If you do find someone getting tilted and their performance worsens then take that as a personal bonus and use it to get the upper hand, that's what a competitive game is all about after all.


You literally said the reason people get sick of demo dummies, you are usually alot better then them in every way. It's boring losing against people I know I'm better then because they demo spammed. Its sickening and ruins the game in my opinion. I shouldnt be losing against a diamond 2 just because they dont know how to do anything other then demo.


I get more demos than goals in a match. I have so many exterminations. Too bad it doesn’t give points. 

The best ones are the ones where they caught on to you, try to jump and you just jump with them 😂

When they complain I just quickchat “This is rocket league!”


I find it annoying because you’re not winning by playing the game, you’re winning by stopping me playing  the game.


they’re just angry because they never think to go for the demo, so they assume nobody else will


I hate demos cause I can never seem to land them right, always seem to make me worse off for hitting them


Bah, it’s one of my favourite things about the game. Normally I just go for demos when they make sense, but if I see someone get mad about them in chat, or if they’re just being toxic in general, in my mind it makes them a demo target for the rest of the game.

I’ll make sure I take every opportunity to grab a demo on those players to increase the tilt, and get them to focus more on me than the play. Once they’re suckered into thinking that I’m just demo chasing them, I’ll throw in fakes, wait until they commit to the dodge and peel off in a different direction, this usually results in “Nice Demo!” / “Nice Bump” quick chats - which is entirely the point - to make them take their thumb off the joystick to get those quick chat messages in and make them lose their focus.

I came back from a 3-0 deficit yesterday when solo queueing 3’s for this exact reason. Dude was being toxic from the start, first time I demoed him he got mad about it. Targeted him for the rest of the game, bagged the win in overtime. He called me a prick mid-game and unsurprisingly, he left as soon as we scored the winning goal.

I gave GG’s to the other team, said sorry to them for them having the toxic teammate, and they said gg no problem, it was karma for him being toxic.


This has been an argument since I played the game back in 2017


Chat in 1s... Why tf?


Ahhh the ol monthly discussion


I just always assumed some people mistakingly treated this similar to rule #1 and felt an obligation to complain and, sometimes jokingly, spam chat.


Why do you even care whether people think it’s toxic or not?


Can't hear them whining when chat is muted. Imagine all that effort and rage going into a blackhole.

It's glorious.


I never go out of my way to demo, it's usually a last resort or when practically handed to me. 90% of my demos are complete accidents. (Unless of course you've been demo-ing me excessively, in which case you bet your ass I'll be out for blood)


When it comes to demos I have one thing to say. If you've got the speed, do the deed!!


I have 30k demos and 2k exterminations and it has got me to where I am now. Champ 1. Problem is I can’t flip reset or any of that fancy stuff you kids are doing.


Holy shit this thread hits the front page every week. Who cares.


How I see it, imagine hockey, but you're allowed to pull the stick out of other people's hands and throw it away. Maybe it takes skill to grab and avoid getting grabbed, but in the end all it does is take a player out of the game for 3 seconds. No one likes it.


I'm all for a strategic, well timed demo. I'm not cool with the assholes that spend an entire game trying to demo the opponent.


I beat a kid the other night in overtime after using a few demo's. He invited me to a rematch with demo's and contact turned off. He then invited me into a party where he bragged that he makes so much more money than me. A whopping $600 a week.


"and used to be" in my experience they're still pretty toxic. I just got to champ 1 in doubles and people just drive around demoing specifically me for most of the match and you're going to tell me that isn't toxic.


There are 2 kind of demos. Tactical ones, demoing on counter attack or defense, someone waiting for center...
But there are other people who don't play Rocket League, they play Burnout. Only going for demos. You can almost play without being demoed about 30 secs...

The first demo is ok, perfect, good use of mechanics.
The second is pure bullshit players, simple.


I think demos are funny when they are used as a last ditch effort to “make a play” or score. For example. If the gam starts and demos are on the table. I’m going to assume you lack in skill and usually my suspicions are confirmed when in a diamond lobby and no one can perform any aerials maneuvers and have terrible ball control. These  almost always go hand in hand. Normally when I encounter a player much higher and more skilled then me demos are not necessary as I can’t 1.even reach their car and 2. They out skill me without ever needing to touch my car. Bumps and accidental demos are understandable, it’s a fast paced game and we’re all watching the ball. But targeted demos almost always follow either 1.before a match starts and the player is already showing their weakness in other mechanics and in which case I’ll never let the ball touch  the ground. And 2. After they realize they are loosing and need to come back so demos are what they believe will allow them that opportunity. I always find it funny due to my team and I will be up on points and demos come out but the person is so focused on demoing me in my goals thag he’s not watching and helping his teammates from my teammate setting up a ceiling shot. You can demo me all you want it won’t prevent my team from scoring. On a 1v1 I can see this dynamic changing and I do understand that it’s a tactic for a guaranteed goal and I can’t argue that. However if you in any mode from 1v1 to 3v3 decide that demos are a more viable strategy to anything but confirming a scored goal then you lack in ability’s and your loss ratio shows that gap in understanding.


It's a legit aspect of the sport - in fact it's a part of why RL is the only digital game I genuinely consider a sport. There's no clipping through objects, there's no tab targetting or minmax character attributes, there's nothing you can buy that will make you win more, it's just you and what your hands can do with a rocket car inside an arena.


Just laugh at em and take the W. If they get tilted, they make mistakes, which puts the game even more in your favor


The reason why we hate demo's so much mostly in 1's is that it's a no skill move(most of the time) it's really only annoying when is the other players only move every miss is a bump a whiff they go for a demo. As you said it can turn the tide of a game. Imagine your better then someone but then they JUST go for demo's. It's like a "lack" of respect saying "your too good get out of the game" but that's really when it's overused. Someone that has trained for pro demo's can win a game just based on that and it's pretty annoying for someone that's sometimes better


demo as a strategy doesnt bother me, chasing people around the field for no reason does, it actually usually ends up in a loss for the other team, but im trying to play this game to have fun matches and improve…very annoying.


It's not how demos are used, it's WHEN that people get frustrated at I think. Your team is Losing the game 7-1 and the other team gets bored and trolls with a TM that won't FF? Annoying and my teammates moms a ho. If your team is winning and the other team has given up and just starts demoing? Annoying and your a big baby. You're on the opponets end of the pitch demoing while our other teammate is off getting boost and I'm trying to 1 v 2 in goal on a breakaway? Annoying and you accomplished nothing and still live in your parents basemnt. You use a demo a couple times a match and one results in your teammate clutching in overtime to win the game? Perfectly fine for both teams and your a god amongst men with beauty that none can be compared to, even the gods in heaven look up to you, you might chad of a man.


Played some doubles with a buddy last night, and one team had this really intense goalie that we honestly couldn’t out-tech. We finally resorted to me pulling a demo while he was going to block my friend, and I swear to god this guy went apeshit. He spent the rest of the match going full-sweat and, even though they still won, you could tell he got really pissed because he did the same thing you’ve described: chasing us around just to demo us when we weren’t close to doing anything at all lol.


Nothing drives me crazier than when my teammate will stop to free text a chat and be like “please stop demoing me” and then we get scored on, and then of course the other team isn’t going to stop demoing lol, in fact they will do it more!

Yes true but there is nothing sweeter than when your opponent is over doing trying to demo you, misses an opportunity on the ball, and you turn it into a goal. Nice demo!


It's a viable mechanic.  
I think the problem is when it is excessive.  
If you are defending or attacking and it's tough to score or it is a critical save, I will demo myself. But I usually hate to demo, so I'll bump a player to get him out of the way in defense or attack, for me DEMO is last resort.  
But there are players who go for demo even when there's no action around you.  
You are just keeping a goal or rebounds while the other team is desperately trying to save the goal, and suddenly their 3rd players comes and Demos you. ok fair enough.  
But then it happens again and again and again.  
Genuine dribbles just met with demos and then the other team starts to demo a bit as well.   
There is a particular limit I think, when you can overuse it and it just stops being fun.  
It's as if the other team is salty and the only way for them to win is by that way.  
And spamming "What a Save!!" and others stuff.


Yes, think about air dribble demos, in my opinion one of the coolest goals that is only possible due to a demo


Only issue I have with demos are that they don't give you points anymore. Sometimes you bet a great demo for the block or interception and you get nothing for it bar knowing you did something good. 
But demos are part and parcel of the game. Its the same with people raging because someone used the Shotgun in The Last of Us Factions ot raging because of Quick Scope Snipers in CoD. Its part of the game. Get over it. Not our fault you'd rather cry about it than get better or use it yourself, you know?


Thanks!


I'm awful at the game but my cousin in a grand champ or whatever it's called.  We play two's and I'd just demo people so he can score easier lol it's a fun time


I think people need to learn that part of the play is one thing, and head hunting is another. Just as annoying as the freestyling smurfs.


Every technic are viable and fair technic until they become your ONLY technic. Getting demoed 4 or even 5 times, when they were times when I could've saved the ball if I weren't demoed is ok, but getting demoed by someone who let his teammates do everything and just focus on demoing people is unfair and ruin the gake for others. 

I've played against teams where one guy would only go seek other player to bump and demo them, making the game unplayable for me because I could play for more than 10 seconds without being demoed. 

Again, it becomes an unfair mechanic if it's the only mechanic you know and use. You should be kicked out from a game if you demo someone more than 10 times in 5 minutes.


I don't complain about demos anymore cause half the time it messes up the team who's trying to demo's rotations, but it definitely a cheeky annoyance that makes you think "really, asshole?" Especially when they go way out of their way for it. Half the time it's so unnecessary.


The majority of rocket league players are literally children, or young people who have not yet reached mental or emotional maturity. It is therefore not hard to understand why players behave childishly. Yes you are right, they need to grow up. Because they have not. I’m not saying it makes the behavior acceptable. Not at all. It sucks. It is childish. 
Just saying that it is to be expected. I advise you accept it’s occasional inevitability and ignore it. 

Just one point of view.


They can always jump over the demo its not that hard, the majority of the players(excluding high Champs to SSLs) don't know how to demo against a jump, so its easy.  


For clarity, I am saying that anything below mid-Champ doesn't know how to demo a jump.


Getting a demo in RL is the equivalent of picking a support in OW or LoL if used correctly. There are times where you might get demoed on offense and it puts you back with 33 on defense. Demos are really complicated to get right. If people are bothered by it, they should stick to playing pms with demos disabled or play another game. RL is a 3rd person shooter, and I’ve never seen a community upset about dying in fortnite or other 3rd person shooters


Demos in heatseeker are for scum tho like congrats you demoed someone who’s focused on an arcing laser ball


It's literally in the game for that reason.


Shoot it’s just as hard to hit another player as it can be to hit the ball sometimes lol. Even having the awareness to go for a well timed demo is tough to add into your mechanics, let alone executing it.


especially right now, when demos feel very inconsistent for some reason


"Demos are OP" is part of the argument? I mean, in a competitive game in which the objective is to win, why wouldn't everyone do what the OP is then? If that's true, demo back and GG.

About that game mode where the ball gets increasingly higher speed after every touch. Heatseeker? Anyway, that's where demos are OP and a needed strategy in order to win. I don't play that mode for this reason.


I've had games where I specifically look for a bunch demos. If I see a guy hanging in the goal, goodbye. If I see you waiting for the ball to land, goodbye. If I can't get to the ball but you are close and trying for it, goodbye!!!


Demos may have been op years ago but have long been seriously nerfed by the addition of blinding black clouds.


The corollary being, if demos are OP against you, you are just bad.


Exactly it’s great offense to go demo the keeper while you’re teammates bringing the ball out. And at a certain level it’s not too hard to jump out of the way i think it’s a great mechanic


Yeah, how is it OP? Like, anyone can get a demo, but if you're chasing someone around the map to get it you're team loses a player for a few seconds, which is quite ironic and backfiring imo


The only thing that is kinda op is spawn demos cause you can get demoed before being able to do anything.


Demos are like Combo Breakers in KI… they just need to be a part of the game


I’m c3 with a thousand hours or so and I think demolitions are overpowered. You can literally remove your opponent from the field of play for 3 seconds. In a game like rocket league, that’s kind of insane 

Demos also introduce one of the only instances of RNG in the game which I also think has no place in rocket league. This RNG spawn also completely messes up a team’s rotations so even when you spawn back in, your team is still disorganized for a few more seconds until you re-assimilate into the rotations. If you spawn on the “wrong” side then you’re even more fucked 

Demos are really strong lol. I understand you incur a positioning risk by attempting a demo, and if your opponent dodges the demo then you’re out of position, but the reward outweighs the risk imo. 

Simply being slightly out of position from a missed demo is way less detrimental than being completely removed from the field of play and then RNG spawning and having your rotations scrambled. The reward greatly outweighs the risk and that’s why I think the mechanic is overpowered


People lag switch me and do unreactable demos cuz their car teleports into me


I honestly think demos don't do enough, I think the respawn timer should be a few seconds longer.


The amount of people in high Diamond/Champ 3's who cost their team goals by chasing a bad demo vastly outcompetes those who demo effectively. Im not saying coming out of defensive rotation to demo is always a bad idea, but for the love of god if you are going to do it, someone has to challenge the ball, you keep giving us uncontested shots at goal!


“Just press A”

That’s my fav reply lol. Cause I mean 🤷🏼‍♂️ ..just jump lol


I always opt for any lyrics from Michael Jackson's "Bad"

I mean, how are they supposed to respond to:

"Your Talk Is Cheap

You're Not A Man

You're Throwin' Stones

To Hide Your Hands"


Lmao imagine the tilt


I just reply learn to dodge lol use your camera. No excuse for gettin demoed outside attacking the ball. If you get demoed just roaming around it’s your fault 100%


As if demoing is really easy 

It is sooo risky and not worth attempting most of the time in 2s and 1s


OnLy ReAsOn YoU wOn Is BeCaUsE oF DeMoEs


That was a demo masterpiece


I hear ya, never thought of that. I suppose it’s extra frustrating for lower ranks. This guy was destroying me in D3 1v1, so I’d be inclined to class him as fairly decent? Then again, I’m such a bad 1s player in that same rank.


Even as a competetive player it is fine to not be happy with a certain meta. It happens in most games, that at some point there is a dominant playstyle that yields the most success, but is not popular even among the most competitive players (Take overwatch's 3 tank 3 support meta for example). Sure, you should not complain about the players using these mechanics to gain an advantage, but you can still dislike the playstyle and find it frustrating or not fun.


Would you say the same applies even in casual playlists? I mostly do nothing but demo chase in casual 3v3 lobbies every game, (and iirc my casual MMR is like 1163??), so I'm going around racking up 10+ demos a game on my fellow plats and such. I've never thought much of it until your comment, and i didn't think to consider that when im in lower ranks it could be genuinely upsetting.


I've seen more complaints about complaints about demoing than I have complaints about demoing.


Thanks lil bro


I love when it turns out beneficial


I think these people almost always rage post  shortly after being tilted off the game and care more about venting then logic.

What annoys me is the same repeated hypocrisy in each sides post. The demo'rs always act like they don't know why their opponent is mad and pretend like everyone \*likes\* to be demo'd. Yeah, the person being demo'd probably overreacted and are being unjustifiably toxic, but stop playing dumb like you don't know why. There are so many sore-losers in this game and a lot of the demo'rs clearly like to push their buttons further when they lose their shit.

And the "Demos ruin the game" posts always have some "I'm all for demos but... here's a list of reasons that I hate demos that's so long that you wonder why I play the game. Also, half of the reasons I hate demos are personal rules that I created only in my head and expect random opponents to follow as if it's a rule 1"


Maybe he's new to the subreddit? Not everyone is on reddit 24/7


Are we going back to posts about freestylers not using free play?


> what do you get out of making a Reddit post telling a story of how someone got extremely mad at demos?

At the time of this comment, 1038 free karma points. (increasingly smaller font effect if I could be bothered to format it) and it wasn't even particularly well written or interesting


They’re outplaying the opponent while the opponent cries about it. And instead of winning the game being enough satisfaction, they have to come here just to show off how proud they are of it


Why post anything anywhere about anything? My dude, this is my first post on the topic and is the first time I’m engaging in conversation about it. Fresh off the back of that game I mentioned, i wanted to vent. The post is completely legitimate and within the rules, why does it bother you so much?


You could say the same things about posts about Smurfs, servers, lag, the best videos to watch, rule1, the list goes on and on. Without all of these commonly seen posts, the subreddit would be empty.


Dude yes but not fully? it's also not even not liking losing, but something else entirely.

I just had a game against a 2v2 where we were down 4-0 and they were clearly better than us.

:53 left and my teammate has the ball and I try to demo or bump the goalie 3 separate times, and he juked me every time. He then scores a goal on a bad bounce from long range and didn't stop spamming "what a save!" for the rest of the match.

There's something about demos or even attempted demos that just make a small section of the player base fly off the handle.


This dude was winning though


i always drop a single "Holy Cow!" after i get demo'd cuz holy cow, you blew me up!


Huge brain - I’d be in the palm of your hand


My confession time: I'll go for demos until someone gets mad enough to demo chase me and then I play the game normally while avoiding said player. And somehow it works.


Because people that base their whole playstyle around demos are almost every time the ones that get mad and toxic in game. I rarely see people just get toxic over demos but the players that constantly go for demos get mad after losing or start to what a save! you after scoring while they are losint 5:2. 

Last week i had a dude that didn't even try to touch the ball he just wanted to demo but missed every time. After ever goal we scored he wrote a whole essay about how bad we are and called me boosted.


People need to stop being babies about posts on Reddit, it seems


🤣


if only lol.   
I would say that would be cool but it would be like giving a dunce cap to people who constantly abandon games. It'd be seen as a rare commodity and a bragging right.


My team uses me as an "enforcer". I use a distinct sounding boost and after the first few demos the other team starts splitting their attention btwn the ball and me when they hear me coming. It puts them off their game, messes up their rotations and, in the best scenarios, someone gets salty and starts focusing on trying to demo me which makes it easier for my team


In 2s or even 3s shutting someone down with demos can be viable


That's.... part of it. 

If I find a weak player to exploit, I will. My team will win. I get rank. I see no issue. 

If you are the weak link, it's not my fault.


Imagine that in a sub with over 1m users, incredible


Exactly, there's so many people defending demo now that it feels wrong to get angry at demos even though it is one of the most tilting ways to get scored on. It should be acceptable to hate on demos and players known for demos because it's a tilting mechanic, but not acceptable to underplay the value of demoing as a strategy or game mechanic


No honestly, that’s on me, I should have known we were playing no demos


Fr man. Been on my mind for weeks as I use them effectively as part of my gameplay.


However, this is in fact the first time I’ve ever posted it. As a casual on the sub, I apologise for the inconvenience as well as all of the demos that annoy you.


I hope if you get Covid, you lose your sense of smell, and when it does come back, the only thing you can smell and taste is farts.


I must admit that lately, it does feel they’re a bit broken


Demos are inconsistent right now. Imo every time they have tried to make demos more consistent they make it less.


Have you noticed the ball being weird lately? I've seen a lot of glitching balls that wrap around people. Desync maybe?


It really depends on rank and playlist. The higher level rank you are, the tougher it becomes to score on your opponent or even demo your opponent. It just opens up options and can even make a play more exciting at higher ranks. At lower ranks it feels dirtier because it takes a lot less skill to demo. At higher ranks it’s more skillful because if you mess up a demo play you put yourself at a heavy disadvantage.


Completely agree. Can't wait for all the downvotes


If you removed demos but kept bumps it would be so much worse. You could just get dribbled around the field like you were caught in a rumble tornado.


I agree, a lot of comments here with people supporting demos which surprised me, I don’t mind the occasional demo here and there, but what gets me is when players rely on them to score or defend constantly throughout the match, learn how to play properly, make a save or decent shot without relying on having an open net or no opponent to win…


Shock you scored on someone after demoing them?


To his own detriment. I felt guilty he tilted so hard. My chats going off for a bit, I think. Time to give that a try.


Lots of advice to do that. I’m gonna give it a try!


Haha, those open net misses when you’re sitting with a screen full of smoke! I feel ya


Ayy man you do you haha


As someone who has chained 4 demos in a row on the same guy a few times, I can guarantee you it's absolutely hilarious for the guy doing it. Haven't been lucky enough to get a 5 bagger yet.


Yeah, but the point I wanted to make for this post was that it was a relatively simple, solitary demo that led to 1 consolation goal. Dude imploded! Haha


Or avoid it? Don't be a sitting duck? It's like getting mad at basketball players for scoring layups as opposed to shooting 3s


I hear you, but I addressed the potential toxic side of them being persistent. My anecdote here is that the kid lost his mind over the very first one! It really shocks me how tilted people get in general, let alone from demos.


Sounds like someone. Weds to get good and avoid them


Right. Seriously think I might take people’s advice of turning chat off though, cos even other people’s rage can affect me sometimes. Heard good things about turning it off.


Very true


While true, you wouldn’t spam chat and be toxic about it as a response. I love this game, but you’re right. Demos are a lottery sometimes!


I guess it’s just my perception, but the guy’s demeanour completely flipped like a switch. Won the game solely because of it!


Demos aren’t op at all. When u go for a demo you’re risking a giant overcommit on offense that if failed will most likely result in a goal in your own net. It’s high risk high reward.


1.1k hours and i dont get upset at demos, like never, even when i get demod 4 times in 1 minute (like in a match today), i just sit there and think: "at least now i cant miss the ball", "shouldve seen/heard that coming", "oops, my bad", "couldve dodged that"

its literally not annoying to me i dont understand how people can rage at it so much and so easily

the one thing that might be annoying is how inconsistent they feel like right now

/srs


I feel the same way about flip resets and double taps...
#/S


If I've learned one thing from solo queue teammates, it's to never take a guaranteed free win for granted


Hi Seph. Yes, demos are great 👍


Some people just want to grind their demo stat up to make the leaderboards, and it's better to do in casual instead of throwing in comp. 

Though the jump button defeats them most of the time.


I casual I don't have to my rank to lose if I'm always out of position just to chase


People that go for demos constantly in casual are the worst. Casual should be chill to try new things and just play. Isn't bad if you want to win but if you tryhard in casual (which most demo bots do) you're a piece of shit.


Demo good


For me, I’m competitive to a fault. I want to win in any way possible, even if it means more demos.


True!


Yes. Do we get everyone from here on out to always come back here?


I’m only d3 in 1s, actually 😂


I saw that first hand. Guy had me on toast and somehow lost.


No.


I could not disagree any more. Demos or not, however you win, it’s valid. So long as you’re not smurfing on an alt, you deserve the rank you’re at exactly 100% of the time.


isnt 1v1 literally the easiest mode to dodge demos because all of your concentration is on the opponent?


And it’s this comment again


Another comment, another person whining about this post being unoriginal.


Objective is to win. Don’t care how you do it.


Excuse me sir, have you ever heard of the team V1 who just won the fall cup?


Sounds like your friend is bad at avoiding demos.


I've seen the same things posted about demos maybe 2-3 times a week for the last 4+ years. I don't really care because the average person isn't going to search reddit history to make sure their topic hasn't been asked before, but the extremely repetitive demo topics are usually something very similar to one of these 3 topics:

## "Demo ruin the game/should be removed. I don't hate demos but... (contradicting reasons that they hate demos:toxic/chasing)"

## "Are demos toxic? ... No because demos are tactical/part of the game. I don't chase the whole time. I beat my opponent with demos and don't know why they're mad" (this post)

## "I have a brand new idea: custom demo explosions"


I'll do anything for the win. You don't get extra credit for playing by some made up gentlemans' rules.


Ha true! But they’d still be every bit as important to mine and lots of others’ playstyles.


Hey at least you’re honest 😄


Haha, holy cow!


Hey thanks man, haha. He had me fully beat though, that’s the bit that blew my mind the most.


So true


Is that such a big deal? I haven’t posted anything of the sort, nor have I ever made comments on similar threads. I wanted to post on the sub to discuss. Seems like lots of people aren’t okay with that.


I did enjoy winning the game after being close to forfeiting!


I saw that! Fascinating watching it at that level.


get babboon'd look at discord


Wish I was as good as that guy


I’m doing it. I can’t wait.


Haha, I’ve come to realise that. Many of them are in the comments complaining that they’ve read these discussions before.


You’re not alone with this thought. Respectfully, I wanted to post this to discuss my experience. Am I supposed to go back and find someone discussing the same thought? I’ve never posted or commented on this topic? That’s understandable, right?


That’s fair my guy


Such a common suggestion. I’ll be trying it out, for sure.


A good point, well made. I don’t really know how to respond because you’re definitely right, haha.


This is my feelings exactly. I just can’t understand why they get so mad.


Subjective, to be honest. I guess it’s only the opponent or the person getting demoed that can decide whether it’s toxic or not.


Haha, nah bro I think most would agree with that


I can understand why that would be annoying, but I did it one time. In my opinion, it was clever cut off to afford me space which led to a goal. My guy lost his shit after the first one.


The perfect response


Lmao true


Ayy at least you’ve given me a month. It’s hourly in some people’s heads.


This could be it to be honest


If you don’t, you don’t have to say anything. I’ve never posted anything of the sort, I don’t see the issue.


What a fascinating analogy. A very interesting perspective.


Very true! Haven’t thought of it like that, but each point you made is a reason we love it.


I know it’s the typical response to a comment like yours, but I think the timing of a demo does take a bit of game sense and skill to recover from/take advantage of.


At a certain point it becomes notably more difficult to hit the players than the ball.

Despite how it may feel, the ball doesn’t try to avoid you.


I will go for a demo every single time my tm8 has possession and we're in a 2v1. 

I really don't think people would like Rocket League as much if demos weren't a thing. Especially as you go higher and higher up in the ranks and peoples' defense gets better, demos become more and more of a necessary game mechanic to break up gridlocks. 

Just look at RLCS. Right now the RLCS meta is moving towards one that is more demo heavy, because the pros' defense has gotten so good that without demos they'd just be relying on tiny mechanical and rotational mistakes for goals. 

From a viewer perspective especially, a demo-less RLCS would eventually become nearly unwatchable.


Usually harder. The ball is much larger, and doesn't change directions randomly. Also, going for a demo usually puts your car out of position for any kind of play on the ball (and your opponent resets after three seconds with 33 boost), so it's not like it's a free goal or anything. I guarantee that if you spent the whole game trying to get demos, you probably won't win most of the time.


Even harder


On top of not being able to lock your cam on a person the ball never accelerates or changes direction without being hit or hitting something, a person dosen't folded those rules.


Seeing sparks as you hit a car while supersonic but not getting a demo is my favorite thing in the game


I wish they had Heatseeker full time and not just an LTM. I think demos seem like a bigger strategy in Heatseeker because people can’t play it enough to realize it’s pretty easy to beat


It's also much less annoying to get demo in rank as like the point is to really win but in casual with little to no significance to the players profile it just gets annoying


Isn’t that balanced by the fact that

a. They have to guess which of the spawn points you will be at
b. Player trying to spawn demo also takes themselves out of the play almost entirely.


But dodging demos is as much a skill as demoing is. And the higher you go you need to be able to dodge and land with a good recovery in order to block a shot or whatever.

Plus demos/bumps are not just an offensive skill but are awesome when used on defense or just as a tactical thing to throw off the other team.


And other things diamonds tell themselves to make themselves feel better


I think 3 seconds is fine. It might seem like demos don't do enough at our rank but at the higher ranks where people can score much more quickly, a 5-6 second respawn timer would make demos nearly an automatic goal (especially in 1s and 2s). I think that would get degenerate and boring pretty quickly.


That’s insane. Demos do not need to literally be free goals lol


A couple years ago I remember absolutely tilting a dude because I specifically didn't jump when he tried to demo me. I can't remember the exact context, but he came flying in and I just sat grounded in net. He jumped and soared over me and I was able to get the save and my teammate scored the counter. 

The wall of text afterwards from him in utter disbelief that "literally anybody would jump... but not you. You just sat there" has stuck with me for this long.


I jump demo people like you


I just reply "What a play!" And get even 🤣


Only dumb players say "Just press A". The correct statement is "Just press X". Sony controller master race.


20 in one game. Just nuts.


D3 is high, regardless of what the really amazing players think. Plenty of them here. *New* RL players likely can't hit a "easy" aerials and totally forget flip resets or fast kickoffs, etc. Nobody in bronze or silver is hitting those, and probably doesn't know they exist. That's the "new player" I'm referring to, and those imo more likely to find things anti-fun as they're far more casual, and playing for fun without being very competitive.


Good point. I should have said "anyone trying to win should use the best strategy, and if that commonly includes demos, they'll do it". We can still like or dislike different metas.


I think it applies *more* to casual playlists. Some players will avoid ranked because they find it stressful. It's difficult for me to show that through data though. Hopefully, matchmaking wouldn't put you with someone significantly worse than you, so you shouldn't be beating up on newbies if you're in plat. At that elo, even in casuals, players should be used to demos so even if they hate being demo'd, it won't affect them as much. 

I also think that being nice in chat goes a long way too. Play the way you find fun, just don't grief people.


Because at this point, a majority of the community are in two baskets, they demo someone and laugh or get demo’d and get pissed. No one will admit how shitty it is to get demo’d because they are afraid of negative reactions but also that you simply cannot hand out demos without possibly reciprocating. It’s the rocket league cycle of life!

Shit, I’ll admit when I get demo’d I get full tilt but when I hand them out I laugh like a maniac!


Fot real. It feels like OP had never been in this sub. 

I doing think he realizes that complaining about others being babies about him demoing them makes him as much of a baby as them.


What a douchey response


Awesome take. They kinda feed off of each other. These posts will exist as long as people cry about it, and demo-hate posts will exist as long as the salt miners have people to feed on.


People who make posts calling for the removal of demos are whiny piss babies.

People who make these kind of posts are just obnoxiously implying that you're supposed to like/be ok with everything that can happen to you ingame. For any of us who aren't grinding for RLCS, it's wrong to go out and tell people that they're supposed to have that level of equanimity at all times in a game we're primarily playing to have fun.

I view demos the same way I view your opponent flopping the nuts in a hand of poker. Yeah, you signed up for those potential situations when you decided to play the game but that in no way means that you're required to be completely stoic when it happens to you.


What gives you the assumption that I’m on Reddit 24/7 either?


I’d rather that then these demo posts.


It bothers me so much because I see these types of posts like 10 times a day. It’s repetitive.

👌


I'm pretty sure, anyway. :)


“You are the weakest link. Goodbye.”


No Fair play award for you then


It’s not about the demos but about how this exact post is created by some casual of the sub every single day. Every single day. If you wanna talk about it why don’t you go find the “demos are a legit mech” post from yesterday or the day before that then comment on that post?


I lost my sense of smell like 15 years ago, but thanks for the well wishes you sloppy bag of mouldy dicks 🖕


Yeah like that stuff used to happen every now and then but lately it seems way more often


Yeah I’ve seen a lot of like wiffs that they def hit it, Some show them hit it then all the sudden nope balls still going on the same path, way more than it used to. Epic servers suck, that’s what I’m wrapping it up as.


I haven’t really considered what the game would be like without them, but I totally get it. That would be interesting for sure!


oh I agree with that. but after a long day of works sometimes I just want to enjoy a casual game while listening to music or in party chat with some buddies. I'm just trying to get in a few cas games. they are allowed to demo. I never said that. nor did I say it's hard to avoid. sometimes I just want to have some laid back games in a chill lobby. I can complain about something but still think it's fair. just can be a bit tilting especially if you're here to chillax. just my 2 cents


yes I definitely see that a lot as well haha. I hear an explosion then by the time I look at chat all I see is "wow" "wow" "thanks"


Counterpoint: you can find people of every rank up to pros who will call demo playstyles cringe. 

It's not a skill issue. Some people just find demo-heavy playstyles annoying and that's about the extent of the issue. Ultimately it's their problem because demos are here to stay (and I'd even go as far as saying the game would be worse without them) but let's not pretend there's some level of skill beyond which nobody is annoyed by demos.


Depends on your playlist and rank. In 2s, they can be pretty OP for sure. Top level 2s has been in a demo meta for a while now.


Demos are situational. Just like any type of aerial mechanic, there are situations when demos are OP *and* low risk, but it's just a mechanic that depends on how it's used. With the same logic, you could say that  aerials are not OP at all because if you go for aerials the entire game then you'll be constantly low on boost, double committed, and usually leaving from High Risk low reward angles that you'll be beat to with ease. Just because there are bad demos and bad aerials doesn't mean they are not op at all.


The way i see it, if someone can consistently get demos on me than fair play to them.


5k hrs here. I mean pros get annoyed by them too. Also they are totally fair I don't dispute that. Of course getting taken out of the game can feel annoying for some people at times. Same thing with too much CC in games like OW, it's just a mechanic that makes you not able to play the game and thus can feel annoying to people. Is what it is, you can't change the fact that people will sometimes get annoyed when you do it. Just ignore them.


I usually start laughing if I get demo spammed. I get more frustrated when I get bumped around like a pinball by everyone, including my own team, in succession and feel like I'm not able to move for at least 10 seconds because of it.


yes

DAE le demo good?? Underrated hidden gem xD


What do you mean the ball isn't trying to avoid me? 

How do you explain I miss so much the ball then?!

/s


Not sure what your comment is supposed to mean lol. I’m saying it’s hard to hit opposing players.


Absolutely this. As soon as you get to Champ 1/2 you start getting grindy 0-0s and a demo can really unlock the game.


If bumps still exist and demos got removed, the bump is a way bigger advantage most of the time.


You'd be surprised


While a guy going 2mph somehow gets a demo on me


If you're are able to keep their momentum after the first demo it's fairly easy to get a second demo. Yes it is 50/50 but you keep momentum and are going to get a full boost pad to all you to rotate.

Even though it seems like you're out of the play when demoing you're aren't. Which is what makes demos strong at high levels. Someone can still pass you the ball and you can make a play on the other teams net. You're stealing your opponent resources in the form of boost.

Plus getting spawn demoed is very obnoxious.

All that's needed is a 1 second immunity to demos on spawn. People that are good at demos and bumps will still be able to make a play or juggle for the demo. While it gives their opponents the opportunity to react.

What makes normal demos high skill and balanced is the other person can react and try to avoid them. Having no counter play to something is a bad gameplay mechanic.


The problem is getting demos is much easier than avoiding them, even if both require some skill, and that's not even including the RNG of spawning randomly on one side of a field that can essentially determine if you get scored on or not. IMO that's the biggest imbalance of demos - they're too easy to get and the respawn is RNG. Demos are OP, bumps are not.


I’ve probably gotten my fair share of demos on high ping players too where I teleport into them. The mechanic doesn’t work well in online games imo


If you demo an opponent in your defensive area, they respawn faster than they could realistically rotate back in many cases. Counters can be killed by a demo and respawn, and I think that's pretty silly.


Some people can’t handle when they think they did something to look dumb and will become violent. I always wonder how these people in RL chat handle real life stress. Are they abusers? Are they depressed? It’s just sad.


It’s like goaltending in soccer, you just pick a side and stick with it. Either jump or call their bluff and stay planted. I’ve had lots of people jump over me assuming I’m gonna jump when I don’t lol.

I also think brake checking people works quite well if you have field awareness and see them coming early enough


You guys remember when The Peeps beat G2 at a dream hack and other pros were saying the Bump/Demo strat wouldn't work in RLCS?? Lol


20 in a game with professionals is totally insane. He could demo myself and my gold level all day, but to get to that level and do that…..will that record ever be broken?  (I assume it’s a record?)


To be fair, it was a 7 minute OT and he got most of them during it. Regardless, you love to see it!


I got 50 today on the cube game.


I can always appreciate a good demo, usually goes something like "oof, what, oh well alright, that's solid".


I prefer the ones that they go out of their way to do so though, that tells me they're extra conscious of *me* which gives me a lot of zoning power


You're a baby when you start being toxic because your ego can't handle something. Just complaining in life doesn't make you a baby. Feedbacks are important.


I can only apologise for not seeing posts like this. I don’t use Reddit every day. Though it’s not only not against the rules, this is my story and word for word, my opinion. Impressive that people want to just be negative in the comments rather than pose a contrasting opinion etc.


What were you expecting him to say though ? You rarely see people respond positively to being told their post is unnecessary or common.


Well you were talking about these type of posts always being made. This is one of the few I've seen while on this subreddit 🤷‍♂️


Maybe visit the sub less?


Right, I hate that mentality in any game.  Blame anyone but themselves


Nice demo!


Is the bag poorly organized, hastily thrown together, or somehow wet?   Bag of moldy dicks would have been completely ignored…throwing sloppy in there has made me think way more about a bag of dicks than I ever would have liked to…well done


Can you still smell farts?


I had to come back to compliment you on your most excellent insult.


I think we found the person that OP played against lmao


I hate it because I see them hit it so I turn to make a play and the ball is suddenly not going that way anymore lol


That's not really a counter. It more backs up my fact that it might annoy someone but people should be more observant and try defend as well as offend


I’d say it depends most on the level of the game. If you’re in a high ranked 2s lobby and overcommit on offense to go for a demo and miss you will most likely concede a goal. 3s is definetly a safer mode to go for a lot of demos


I agree with you but i don’t necessarily think there is an ”Op” mechanic in rocket league in general when playing against people of your skill level.


EXACTLY!


well, where is the ball, either you have it or the opponent has it. and the ball moves predidctable, not like the opponent, so you should at least be more focused on the opponent


Cuz you said “it can sometimes be just as hard to hit the players as it is to hit the ball.” It’s def harder to hit the players than to hit the ball imo hehe


Maybe in Diamond, but from Champ onwards a lot of people can use flips, wavedashes and/or air roll to recover very quickly from bumps. If you look at high level gameplay they only really bump the keeper to secure a goal, or bump an attacker to stop an aerial play. Outside of that, investment of boost/positioning is not really worth it for a simple bump.


0 boost being bumped to Narnia vs waiting 3 seconds to spawn at your back line with 33 boost and right next to a full pad?

Yeah, you're completely right.


I have t-boned other players to get a demo and been blown up for it. I don't understand it lol


rumble?


I would be OK with the 1 second immunity.


> What makes normal demos high skill and balanced

it doesn't make them high skill (lmao) or balanced, it makes them random


Agreed


I agree. I personally hate everything about demos. Connection based issues included


So just to be clear, you think it's silly that killing someone in your defensive third doesn't automatically lead to a protracted 2v1/3v2?


The scrub killa tweet didn't age too well


it is the record for most demos in a single RLCS match!


Why would we have a contrasting opinion when we agree with you? They were just simply saying that complaining about people who complain about demos is as pathetic as people who complain about demos. Especially when we see this talked about all the time in this sub, its not like its an unpopular opinion or anything. No shade intended.


Yeah and it's not just being told that the post is unnecessary, it was implied through a passive-aggressive comment. Albeit one I thought was funny but still there nonetheless.


I wasn't expecting anything out of someone who comes here to "vent" about successfully demoing someone, tbh. Doesn't mean it wasn't douchey


Yea, I talk about it being made a lot because they are. How does that give you any indication that I’m on Reddit all day?


For real, or here's a thought, ignore it and find something that does interest you. I swear Redditor's inability to ignore posts they don't like or care for is what is incredibly pathetic. I see a post I don't like or feel is repetitive, I downvote and continue on.


No not me, I love demos lol


Oh yeah so annoying


Well, in the context of the comment you were replying to it sounded like you were implying that there's no reason to dislike demos beyond not being good at predicting/avoiding them. And that just aint true.


I got it lol, I was not intending to say that they were equally difficult. So that was my fault.


While what you say is mostly true, if you bump a player right after they jump, they get sent to the moon and at that point id rather just get demod


beg to differ.


Even with 5 boost and a fair reaction/recovery skillset you can balance back out enough most of the time, but anything less and you're going into orbit, especially if they're supersonic.


What the client sees and what the server sees are two different things.


This has been happening to me more and more often lately.


Any mode. In ranked 2s today, the opponent was stationary in net and somehow gains enough speed moving from the net to the corner to demo me without him getting bumped towards me or wavedashing. That's not the only instance but that's one that happened today so it's fresher on my memory.


I think it's silly that it takes less time to respawn than to cross the field.


In NA. I believe there was one EU game in the past where someone straight up demo chased (didn’t touch the ball at all) and got like 22 or 25


On top of your point, why would anyone want to put themselves out there over such a blanket statement post?

“People need to stop being babies” -> “why won’t people disagree with me”

The logic isn’t adding up because the topic is already leaning in a favorable statement, so that any negative feedback would be treated as purely argumentative thus receiving a bunch of shit for. Aka it’s a bait post/karma farm style popularly against the rules of subs like r/unpopularOpinion: can’t post things that people would automatically assume to be agreeable.


Not to mention there has ended up being so many more comments telling me that this is unoriginal. My response was pathetic but I just gave up reading that unnecessary negativity.


Well if you're seeing it so often you're probably on reddit a lot then. Don't know what else to tell you lmao


I agree with you. It's understandable for those that struggle to avoid them and lack the defensive capabilities to be annoyed


Demoes are also nog always viable with certain tm8s bc the rotation just doesnt allow you to get that demo and then go back, you just have to go back


This.


Yeah but that’s like one case, and it doesn’t happen very often


Elaborate please?


That's the point. If they're going supersonic it should be a demo. The few times I bump or get bumped by someone going supersonic I just send the guy flying because of an odd impact angle. There's not a damn thing people can do about it unless they expend stupid amounts of boost. Just land on your wheels across the map and start the trek back to position.


True. It's the same with the ball glitching I was talking about in another comment. Straight wraps around someone or goes back to another direction lol


Same with the ball glitching. Seems the servers are getting worse. I get as low as a 32 ping, there should be little variation of what can happen on the screen. If I understand latency correctly.


Why is that silly?


The EU RLCS record is 14 from Scrub Killa in RLCS X. The all-time EU record is 18 from Piatrix. 

I believe you were thinking of Virtuoso, who while known for his demolitions in RLCS X, his best record is only 10 demolitions during that season, although his best in all events is 13, done during the RLCS S9 Promotion Playoffs. 

There have only been 3 players who have achieved 20 demos or more in pro play. Snowyy in SSA during the Fall Split with 23, Woody for Charlotte Phoenix during the BFC Forko Cup last year with 21, and obviously Comm with 20.


You sure you're not thinking of Allushin for Faze in RLCS X? That was the previous record. Think it was 17 demos in 1 game and he only got 22 points in the whole game. 1 ball touch and 2 exterminator medals was where he got the 22 points lol.


I’m telling you to use your brain. If the posts are very common, I don’t need to be on Reddit a lot to see them.


Yeah. I mean demos don't really annoy me that much but I don't see the value in creating this post except to virtue signal some kind of emotional strength.


less investment, don’t force it. opportunities arise and it can be beneficial. i agree that fishing for them will only be a disservice.


Rocket League: opponent just hit the ball!

Rocket League 20ms later: jk lol


Hell I regularly show a sub 20 ping on the rocket league menus and still get this stuff. Yea it definitely seems to be worse as of late.


Because being demoed is an advantage in these cases


Who was he playing?  This was a top 4 match to win which I think is crazy impressive. I love NRG by the way but still was impressive


Allushin got 18 in RLCS 21-22 Fall Split, and he had 45 points. He held the RLCS record until Snowyy in SSA broke the RLCS record three weeks later with 23 demolitions.

As a footnote, the highest demolitions for RLCS X was Scrub Killa with 14 demolitions, which is also the EU RLCS record.


Yeah its NA record, there has been 23 in one game in ~~EU~~ SSA

Comm played great saturday and sunday, it was really nice to see V1 take the W


Lol. Maybe, maybe not. But I was watching the V1 vs NRG stream live and I distinctly recall the casters saying that Comm’s 20 demos in one game was a regional record and not an all-time one


You're the only one who made a whole paragraph crying over it. It's not that deep.


That's where the phrase 'man up' comes in


That’s kind of what I was talking about yeah. Like if you’re rotating out and you can bump an opponent off the ball that’s fantastic, but going out of your way to get a non-demo bump is usually a waste in a way that demo chasing isn’t.


When I got my new Internet and got hooked up with ethernet a year ago I was getting about 18 to 32 ping depending on the server. Now I average 50 to 70 and occasionally get the latency warning and lag out for a bit or slide around. The servers are definitely getting worse and Psyonix are ignoring it


So you’re saying there should never be a wrong time to demo someone?


Yep I've always had between 15-30 ping in game.  Ever have any latency warning indicators or the little lag indicators that pop up on screen. Now the last 3 or 4 weeks I get em every few games and my ping is chilling more between 30 and 50 now. 

Don't know what's goin on but hopefully it's addressed sooner rather than later.


I'm saying a demo shouldn't put them in a better position in a shorter time. That's not even close to "there's never a wrong time to demo someone."


Client wanted lemon juice


“Now that I see it, I think it’s important that we use hedgehogs instead of lemons, and the cups should be green and made of glass.”


It's all fun and games until your idiot project management commits you to having the product done yesterday because they believed the demo too.


[When you hear that the next feature will be using glass cups](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/fc/91/abfc91e8c9f6771c083cae9ad033f1bb.gif)


What's not shown is the client's own IT staff in the background, tied up in the corner not allowed to talk on the calls anymore since they ruined the relationship with the last developer for calling bullshit


In my experience no matter how well its working right up to the demo, during the demo, the damn lemon would have dropped out of the cup


now the client has new plans

they're going to create "the next big thing:" a lemon-duplication app (limited to 2 lemons a week unless you buy their premium service, which also includes support for limes)

look what you've done


"Cool! What does this button d-"

"DON'T TOUCH THAT"

As I was watching, it started buffering when she grabbed the cups ... thought this was the joke.


This hurts.


Wow, that's so accurate.   
I do *shshshshuuuuu* too


Oh dear holy Coding Gods, grant me powers to make this lemon disappear just for this demo. Amen.

Remember volunteering for a organisation. The idea was to run a competition and to run a kind of raffle at an event, putting codes on free lollies that were handed out. I offered to organise the labels if someone else stuck them on the lollies. Took me 5 minutes to write an algorithm to save 1000 unique codes in a text file, and 5 minutes to hook up a printer to print the labels from the text file. Apparently it took three people several hours to fold all the labels around the lollipop sticks :) They thought they had the easy part of the deal.

I did actually also put the codes into a database and hooked up a page on our website that allowed the codes to be entered, checked they were valid and announce winners :) I did also code the website. So I guess it worked out fair :)

Well damn Jackie, you CAN control the lemons.

plot twist, its just the clickable mockup, and they want it ready by next month.


Oh you were facing north? Naw it won’t work.


I loved this video when it first came out. It's even funnier with "developer" and "client".


Client complains because they were asking for limes the whole time


This girl: "Mom, what's 6 \* 8?"

Her Mom: "Oh sweety, those are 2 completely different numbers"


For everyone saying the mom is playing along, I would like to remind you that there are people who LEGITIMATELY believe in bigfoot and mermaids.

"Just for the demo, pretend that isn't there, then you just do this, and bam! It works!"


"Testing environment"


Fake. In an actual demo, the lemons would roll off and the cups would catch fire.


Demo starts, dev says "well we didn't complete the sprint, so I'll describe what this one cup is going to be for.  Next quarter we'll have another cup to go with it."


I’m gonna make that sound next time I demo something.

Thats pretty awesome, you can move lemons around like that. Can we make it a lemon party? I'm sure that website name isn't taken.


Ahahaha, it’s true!


She's a witch


Anyway to get the original? I need to change developer to data engineer and client to data scientist


Client described lemon juice to dev as follows:

"Our project consists of lemons and cups. But you can't see the lemons in the finished product. Also the cups are to be inverted. Can you do this for us?"


This is a POC


Yea but look at how distracted they are.  Thats a win to me.


Underrated comment


got Lemon Demon


Client asked for lemonade and got nothing delivered in the two week sprint.


Failed to explain that up front.


But they never said it and then they asked for orange juice...maybe.


It's going to take some magic to get done on time.


“What the hell how did you do that” she says


After trying the lemon juice, we decided that what we actually want is apple sauce

Agreed. Two cups isn't enough either. We're going to need 7 green cups, some made with transparent colourless glass, some with red plastic, all strictly perpendicular. Also can one of the cups be a kitten?


"And make the logo bigger"


Penn and Teller have done Cups and Balls with clear plastic cups.


Why can't you *simply* use hedgehogs?

You're an expert developer, surely you *familiar* with invisible green glass.


Well, Penn and Teller did it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8osRaFTtgHo in the second half


I have green glass cups but no hedgehog


And can the hedgehogs come out in the form of a kitten?


And strictly perpendicular.


Is it not good that they give you feedback?


 I need 1 cup and 2 girls


https://youtu.be/8osRaFTtgHo


Phew we are on the right track then. The cups are 00FF00 afterall


Looks like it’s about done then. Hard ship date in a week?


I watched that video twice and thought they were potatoes. Saw your comment and wondered what the fuck you were on about!

 Bloody night-light mode on my phone I reckon.


| "idiot project management "

Yep


Right? 

So we got the cups working. But the lemons are hard-coded. So when you demo, you'll have to call cup.squeeze(), but make sure you set the global environment variable MAX\_SQUEEZE\_PRESSURE to 10%. Otherwise... well just make sure you set it.


Well then you'll really need a witch to save your ass won't ya?


when your live demo actually had a jr making real time updates in the database


This sums up the last week and half of my life.

"....fuck"


"Bear with me here, we can use LCD cups to visually simulate them being empty, and still keep what we've done so far. No one cares what's really going on in the cups as long as it works..."


And you get started with tech debt


I’ve been in that position. 

Then when developer couldn’t deliver the bullshit it was handed to me to get it working. Of course I spent a few months of “hard” work before resending my original explanation of why it wouldn’t work.


Pre-record your demos.


there should be a long german word for this phenomenon


Or accidentally was substituted with a live grenade


The demo works great as long as you look at it from the right angle and follow the script.


Yup https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=55xqB_pLjlk


When I was in university, my app worked perfectly, all the time... until the demo, in which it showed... but upsidedown! 

I still have no idea how that happened, it's one of the weirdest bugs I've encountered in anything I've written.

Is this the ultimate showdown? Dev vs Client?


Not true, the lemonade is ready to ship, but the cups never got signed off.


I got the story: "As a tired person, I want to have a refreshing drink after working hard." I delivered a cold six pack of beer. Apparently the client can't drink beer? I'm unclear as to whether the client is a child, a person who takes care of children, or has a health condition, but at least I've got cold beer.


I get that reference


> PM: We need 7 cups, and they all need to be orthogonal to each other, but no two cups can be in the same orientation.

Please file a change request.


The problem is that feedback is often given from the perspective of "how does this affect me personally?" rather than "does this provide value to the user?".


Yes. But changing 50% of the specs when you've already done all the work isn't just feedback. It's stuff they should have thought about ages ago.


>project management

Always important to remove redundant words from your naming, just good hygiene.


As a project manager I frequently come here to learn what not to do.


As a robotics programmer its comforting to know this is how it works everywhere else too


"We're using a neural network"


Very clever, Indeed... Just wait for client's face when you tell him we need to raise the budget to buy LCD cups, instead of the green plastic cups he was accounted for during the past review...


You have been developing for far too long.


23 and kind of new in the field. Can you give a realistic example of what a ludicrous request sounds like?


[deleted]


Then the client drops "we wanna se what happens if..."


Yeah, learned this the hard way once.  None of our stuff worked.  Some of it was due to last minute changes on our end, but some of it was also because someone else's last minute checkin hosed us.  If you're presenting, always, at the very least, BYOB (bring your own build), or pre-record it.

For some background, we were doing scrum, except leadership expected us always adhere to the schedule agreed upon at the start of the sprint, discovery work and workflow conflicts be damned.  This lead to a lot of last minute changes getting rushed in.


Excellent idea


I hardcore my demos ;). 

With covid it's hard to see what you are actually doing so you can give a live demo while being 100% the result is perfect.

/r/TheExpanse is leaking again.


That I agree with!


Because often without knowledge of programming people have no idea of what is difficult and what it easy, the entire point the video is making, almost perceiving it to be some sort of magic. They thought it would be hard work when with programming knowledge it took mere moments. Contrary wise, a client might as for something thinking it is easy when in actual fact it is far more complex than they imagine.

Jeez I didn't think the link was that far removed!


"How it was documented"  
"How it was supported"

I felt those in my soul!


A classic.

That's rather easy, just deliver lemons that aren't ripe yet. Now if they asked for red lemons...


Actually, in Mexico lemons are green and limes are yellow.


Time to move the feature to MVP!


I read it as piece of crap.

Had a requirement for a training system. It had to automatically update its employee data to match changes made in the HR system. Had to be fully automatic and near instant. Only issue was the 2 systems couldn’t be linked and we couldn’t use a third database to receive and feed the data. 

After many meetings the penny finally dropped for management when I asked them what number I was thinking of, they said the couldn’t know that and I replied that neither could the system unless we find a way to tell it.

If the only solutions rely on magic or psychic powers then your not going to have a good time. Biggest challenge is usually finding a way to explain why it isn’t possible without causing people to lose face.


Let's say you're showing a video feed. Someone asks you to make it bigger. So you increase the size of the video container. Then they ask for it to also be less blurry. So what they really wanted (but had trouble describing) was more resolution. Which is not a thing that can be done. They have to buy a better camera if they want more resolution.

So long as an environment exists where stakeholders can play, there's no issue. But whatever, you do you.

Ah, another German word I can’t pronounce despite my ancestry being mostly German...


**[Resistentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistentialism)**

Resistentialism is a jocular theory to describe "seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects", where objects that cause problems (like lost keys or a runaway bouncy ball) are said to exhibit a high degree of malice toward humans. The theory posits a war being fought between humans and inanimate objects, and all the little annoyances that objects cause throughout the day are battles between the two. The concept was not new in 1948 when humorist Paul Jennings coined this name for it in a piece titled "Report on Resistentialism", published in The Spectator that year and reprinted in The New York Times; the word is a blend of the Latin res ("thing"), the French résister ("to resist"), and the existentialism school of philosophy. The movement is a spoof of existentialism in general, and Jean-Paul Sartre in particular, Jennings naming the fictional inventor of Resistentialism as Pierre-Marie Ventre.

I get the impression he was just grouchy when he posted that.

The link was clear ;-)


I think that wasn't the point of the video.

I think the point of the video was to show how developers sometimes cheat when demoing stuff to their clients.


What's there to document? There's nothing to it.


Documentation? Never heard of it.


keep adding years I saw this in a design floor at Ford Motor in 1999 and it looked like it had been xeroxed from a fax that had come off of a mimeo


But you're the one that's supposed to be able to make our vision a reality

well, proof of concept, piece of crap, potato, potato


Also stands for “point of contact”. What a confusing acronym.


I know. Was joke.


I can do anything.

Let n = 5


Don't even need extra spatial, we already get the 4 extra dimensions we need for free. Let the first 3 cups be orthogol in R^3 position space as usual. Then either use the tangent space or the cotangent space (they only differ by a metric, so can't use both) for the next 3 cups, and of course let the last cup be in the direction of time.


Demo-driven development. I like it.


Also, can the hedgehog have no spines and a bushy tail?


As a developer, I will give your request the full attention I think it deserves.


Dev: you realize it’s already 5:00 right?

PM: ah you’re right. I don’t want to rush you, I’ll tell you what... nm EOD. Just delete it and have it in my inbox by 8am tomorrow. Thanks! I gotta get going, gotta make it to my dinner reservations


It's gone on my machine.


You don’t belong in here scrub


EOD means 6:59 am the next day right?


by end of decade? okay. It's great we just got pass one


Ah thank you. Good example. How did you end up solving that one?


Yeah I’ve seen that but I’m thinking in terms of like actual project requirements that are insane


I work in tech sales & my company just rolled out a brand new product that's supposed to go live monday & clearly isn't ready yet...1000p suggesting this to the team lol


Oh wow, I thought you were joking because it's actually quite a well known word (in Germany).

Is an opinion, I guess only the video director knows


"The code is self explanatory" - the biggest lie a programmer can tell himself


You're getting my blood pressure up because you're reminding me of that "The Expert" video


Poop of course


Context is key.


Was good joke. I got. He.


Absolutely anything.


Looks like you need an [expert](https://youtu.be/B7MIJP90biM).


 I realized my fist was clenched when the video was over


I did not intend to watch a 7 and half minute video in the middle of the work day. But damn.... I feel this in my soul


That hurts me in ways I wasn’t aware I could be hurt.


Pain. Pain of the soul.


[deleted]


Oh God... It's every frustration of my entire professional career rolled into 7 minutes of pain...


This is brilliant and thoroughly infuriating to watch.


You might be able to do it in 2D on a particular surface. For example on the surface of a sphere you can have 3 lines that are all orthogonal. Not totally sure if there’s a surface you can get 7 with though. Maybe on even higher dimensional manifolds.


I like my women like I like my code.

DDD


Like a squirrel?


Thanks bud! We need to grab drinks soon! First round's on me.


"I asked you more than 2 days ago!"

"yes, on friday at 4:47 pm and now its monday morning 8:30 am"


That's odd...still seeing it on mine.  Let me check with a few others and I'll circle back with you.


If anything you want more project managers in here to see what devs joke and complain about.


"Humor" is in the subreddit name, and you appear to be humorless...so I guess you don't belong here either.


Used a third database to gather HR changes and update the training system 3 times a day. Found the most ambitious stakeholder and convinced him it would win him points with the higher ups if he suggested the idea as his own. Dropped in bullshit bingo words like “synergy” and “paradigm shifting” and sent him on his way. Next meeting comes round and our man trots out “his” idea, we praise him for such a clever idea and his bosses give the green light to change the requirement to allow it. Went from impossible to live in a month.


it also works as a sort of collateral for the other stakeholders on the customer side. a video file can circulate around internally and create traction. also enables your presales to be more agile around starting the conversation without pulling in some poor dev/engineer to click through a boring demo (not to mention you don't have to maintain setup, finance it etc...)

that said, i absolutely hate making video demos lol.


that’s my fault. i think i screwed up my english.

by saying “there should be..” 

-	i didn’t mean: the word doesn’t exist and someone should create a word
-	i meant: i believe there is a word but don’t remember


...*mostly*?


Then they proceed to realize that it's not obvious to non coders and forget to do it anyways


"If it's so easy than documenting it will be super quick, right? RIIIIIIGHT?"


That's what I was going for :)


Piece of Cunt*


With Zombocom


Oh my God, the mad lad did it!


Holy shit! Thank you so much for sharing this. I had no idea this existed


How are those lines perpendicular?


It reminded me of too many kickoff meetings where the customer will ask something like: "Can we do X?" and I say "Oh sure, to do X we'll need to know Y and Z to determine where we can source the data required to deliver X" 

"I dont know if we can provide Y and Z, can you still do X?" 

like bitch did I stutter? The amount of people that think development is pure magic is too damn high.


I laughed at it in uni. Now watching it brings nothing but flashbacks and pain.


>You might be able to do it in 2D on a particular surface. For example on the surface of a sphere you can have 3 lines that are all orthogonal.

If you call it the "surface of a sphere" then you can't go in the radial direction, and you will only have 2 dimensions. That's why S\^2 is a 2 dimensional manifold. If you allow to go in the radial direction, then it is no longer the surface of a sphere, then it is just R\^3 in spherical coordinates.


No, a hedgehog, just with no spines and a bushy tail.


Followed by the polite "Haha yeah for sure" while both of you know that shit's never, ever happening.


haha this is so accurate


Why does a pm have so much power in your world guys? Pm is just a glorified BA, they can't do shit.


Hah... Every request has to be written. No verbal contracts allowed. Any emails are attached to the project.

If its not documented, it didn't happen.


Am a project manager. Literally just commented that and then saw this comment. I'm here because Devs are nice people,  they won't tell me to my face what I'm doing wrong so I continuously pad the budget and the schedule which makes owners unhappy.


The world needs less project managers


 Now *this* is managing up!


why wouldn't you suggest that yourself in the meetings? 

let me guess, because they want everything done their way and not *your* way?


I guess you know about [this](https://mourner.github.io/bullshit.js/).


And he got a promotion while you got a 3% raise.


Ah this brings back painful memories. Similarly, I had to convince a stakeholder to introduce an API to bridge systems.


What do you call this skill specifically? Is it possible to learn this power?


I read it as "In a perfect world there would be a long German word for this (but I don't know enough German to know if there actually is or not)"

FWIW my first language is (American) English


You're right, that's exactly how I read it at first.  
But no worries.


I think I'm also part Banana or something.


Then they proceed to write comments incorrectly telling what the program is doing because they don’t understand what they are doing.


Production on Completion


Of course he did it! He's an expert!


If course he did! He’s an expert!


It depends what type of geometry you use


Since the lines loop back on themselves, each individual line is both perpendicular and parallel to every other line.


The other ones I have gotten are the ones who tell me "We would like X or Y. Do you think you can do that?" "Yes which would you like done?" "Well your the expert you tell us." "What result would you like to happen?" "Z" (or "We don't know")...


Cooking analogies my friend. Everyone understands food.

To make a cake you need flour sugar yeast. Is just one of those things a cake?


This is true but what’s your point?


A baby hedgehog with pipe cleaners attached?


I have a solution for you. Manage your projects better and the position wouldn't exist.


If you are your own project manager, does that mean we need less of you?


I had a good laugh. Thanks for this.


Parkour on Chairs


Nah just ignore it


The worst ones for me are when you ask them to explain what they want the end result to be, and they recite a bunch of marketing nonsense packed full with buzzwords that tell you nothing about what they actually want you to do here.


That you can't have 3 orthogonal lines on the surface of a sphere, which is what you said.


I have a solution for you as well, go fuck yourself. No one asked for a pm at my company, we’d likely be faster without then micromanaging out tasks. You guys don’t know shit about or work, yet you are given control over it’s execution. Something deeply ironic about that.


According to your mom, the opposite


Poop On Cock


Ok so make two orthogonal lines on the sphere. They’ll cross twice on exactly opposite sides of the sphere. Then if those crossings are the poles the equator would be the third line that’s orthogonal to both.


Well, this escalated quickly lol. I can see I hit a sore spot.

Anyway, I'm actually a dual role of PM and feature architect so I know a little about the work.


In terms of primogems, we don't have primogems

Did he just destroy those petrified enemies? Or was that just for theatric effects? Because holy

"They say that, before he set out, he spoke these words..."

*grunting noises*


At the 0:45 timestamp I love how he creates a shield and just stands there doing nothing while 5 enemies attack him at once...his power...


Wtf is up with the cinematography?? That was sick and definitely much better than expected. I'm so hyped for zhongli let's gooo

EDIT: Now we know where Mihoyo spent all our money, and I for one have no complaints


My interest on him went from 0 to 100 after seeing that petrify scene 👀👀👀


The people who edit these character demos really go all out on them. They're honestly great.


The music in this demo is just 👌


I literally think I'm gay now I've watched this 27 times


I am Zhongli sexual

Hes so hot I cant take this anymore


Whoever edits these trailers needs a fukin raise.


That shatter on all the petrified people was sexy


Zhongli’s English Voice is probably the most universally loved voice in the English dub by far

Seriously, Keith Silverstein got one opportunity to do a hot guy (not including Speedwagon) instead of a villain and he nailed it perfectly


Okay, but why does he have so much fucking sauce?


The ult line in CN is cooler 

Instead of:

>I will have order 

It becomes:

>天动万象

Which is something along the lines of “when the heaven moves the whole earth trembles”


Saw this comment on bilibili, loosely translated into: 

All of us swooning over Zhongli on Kaeya's birthday, is this considered a kind of NTR? xP 

Poor Kaeya tho, Zhongli totally stole your limelight.


ZHONGLI'S COMING HOME!


Pspspspsss Zhongli psppspspss


Damn his character demo is on another level. Is this track his own or is it a remix of another one already in the game?


It's hilarious because you can tell how much more budget this demo had compared to I think everyone else's.

And boy did it work. He can take all my 20k F2P primo.


Zhongli, to no surprise, **IS SO FKING COOL**

And I gotta say, this is one of the best character demo. The camera works and animations are great.

Wallet: Why do I hear boss music


I'll tell you what, if anything the fellas at mihoyo knows how to make an alluring trailer for their characters.

I didnt plan to pull for any new characters after the initial venti banner, yet after watching every new trailer i've gone ahead and pulled for klee,diona,childe, and now i want to pull for zhongli without a single built geo unit.

what mind control vodoo joo joo is this? let me skip a god damn banner please.


call me old fashioned, but i was raised to take care of my husband

make his plate every night, wash his work clothes for him, make sure he’s up for work the next morning, always have a clean house for him to come home to, etc. 

and that’s exactly wife i will be


I started playing this game for the anime waifus, and yet since then I've done nothing but shell out for the husbandos.


I was brushing my teeth when this came out so yes, you better believe that I brushed for an extra 1 minute and 55 seconds. Was very worth it.


Gotta love his english VA.


This demo vid is on another level +_+


"I wish not for dominion, yet I cannot watch the common folk suffer"

*cue music*

SOLD!


THAT IS THE COOLEST TRAILER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. SORRY XIAO, DPS ZHONGLI HERE I COME.


I’m 19 rolls off a 50% pity... bless me gods for I have withheld summoning on the character banner since getting venti!


Hoooly shit, if you weren't 100% convinced to pull Zhongdaddy before, then you'll definetly will be after watching this. The moves, the voice and the music were all 11/10. PLEASE COME HOME 😭😭

PS: Is it just me or this has been the best demo until now? Damn I want them to release the full ZHONG they used on this video.


I really can't wait to see what the final contract is!

But shit this whole video was so sexy!


I have 16k primos, all his ascension mats, 450 purple books, a dream, and a team that has been neglected and forced to farm nonstop for him. Please come home!


This trailer reawakened my love for him that has never been extinguished, imagine that. Please come home, Zhongli. I need you.


This is the best demo so far! Mihoyo knew how much we simp for that spear kick


I AM ACTUALLT HHYPERVENTILATING


"What's up, daddy in the house."
Basically this video.


Wasn't expecting Jiraya-sensei to start talking 

I need Daddy Zhong to kick me like that spear


"I WILL HAVE ORDER." Yes, Daddy.


[This is for those who saved for geo dad](https://imgur.com/a/6Jlwhti)


I am at 55 pulls and 7k primos I really hope I pull him, would be my first 5 star. Bless rng


Geo daddy please come home and complete the husbando squad 🙏


Fucking beast mode!!!


!!!Geo Daddy applied wet status!!!


Does the beginning dude voice Jiraya from naruto?


Zhongli : I cannot watch the common folks suffer.

Also in the story when sea monster attacking the habour. 

Zhongli : Ok do your thing. Fire your 3 star weapons.


Imma level with yall, I dont play these games, I'm barely interested but the ads are so nice. I just like looking at a pretty guy, and ngl I'm always getting hit with anime ads for big titty women and I am not the demographic for that.


Stop, my ovaries can't take it anymore.


am timezone challenged how many hour til update and how long it take?


god damn that was the most hype promo vid yet! I’m 100% ready to blow all my primos for geo daddy


Sick beats yo.


My god, I was already ready to open my wallet but this video though. By far the best one (so far). I'm so ready for the ultimate husbando to join my team.


Did his E just affect petrified enemies??? that was so cool


damn the music's DOPE


“I will have order.” 
*Yes sir. Sorry sir. Whatever you want sir.*

Gods, Mihoyo could nerf this man into complete irrelevance and I’d still pull for him and put him on my team.

(My Childe and my Ning will have to pick up after him while he stands there looking pretty but I expect they’ll be used to it by now.)


Here we GOOOOOOO.


JP version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO3_S82III0


I worry for my wallet


The music, the animatics, the ink blot transitions embody so much of the awesome old wuxia shows I watched as a kid on TBV Jade it makes me so happy


If Zhongli doesn't have a large enough fanbase already, this video just confirms that he:

1. can sprout a thick pillar from nowhere
2. is adept at thrusting his stick around
3. can *literally* make anyone hard

I dont even care if i have to live under a bridge at this point, i will give everything to be able to see him kick his spear everywhere


Me : watches Zhongli's trailer 

My underwear : *Let the show begin !* 🎶


My credit card company is going to be so confused.


Just as a note so people manage expectations with the exploding petrified enemies. On https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/6902 they already said it deals no damage


 Zhongli's Q be like ————𒆙


I LOVE HIM 💕💕💕💕


That was sick yo


This trailer is so insane that I am considering getting him his spear while having the Primordial Jade sitting in my bag unused.  Doesn't matter if Primordial Jade is objectively the better spear but MATCHING COLOR SCHEME man.


WHICH ONE OF YOU GENSHIN AMV EDITORS DID THEY HIRE

they made a whole fancam for him...the glamour shots...the music syncing...wtf


Are we sure Zhongli is not a hydro archon? Because he makes us WET.


Damn, he’s so...refined. In everything and everything about him. Got Childe in my first pull I can only hope in vain on getting this sexy beast.


Childe banner was a bait banner after all


I hope they'll upload this video's soundtrack somewhere because it's beautiful omg


I thought Zhongli's element was Geo. Why is this demo fire?


imagine using a character this cool as a support and not main dps lmao


Offtopic: Did he pay for the tea??!?!?


“They say, that before he set out, he spoke these words...”

“Oh... it seems that I have forgotten my mora.”


My 10 fates are ready. Come to me, earth father!


Zhongli is coming and so am i


zhongli is the only geocharacter that can also apply the wet status.


This is it, my first Tall character


P5 VAs Reunited

>!Zhongli: Shido!<

>!Storyteller: Yaldabaoth!<


please please please please please come homeee.  
My dream to have an all archon team wont be complete without you!


Great trailer, however I am curious about the Hold E after Q thing. It is very likely that it is only for the effects in the trailer and won't be implemented ingame. Especially since his Hold E only destroys 2 Geo constructs and not all. But in a legal sense could this be considered false advertisement since it depicts Zhongli in a way that may not happen ingame? 
Don't get me wrong. I am not demanding that he should be broken or anything . I am really just curious about whether this is ok. Of course there is the possibility that his Hold E simply dealt enough dmg to kill all in one go.


That's like the sexiest character trailer ever. Zhongli dijun ILY!!!!!


That petrify sold it for me. Especially if it pairs with his breaking shields E (if that wasn't nerfed)

  


He's going to be so OP.


Why is HE SO HOT?!


I fucking REGRET getting Tartagila now from my pity


I really really need to know how strong the Zhongli-Traveller-Ning geo construct meme comp is. I hope his E is good lol, could make the MC usable.


me : not pulling

zhongli : At 1:17 i ll have order

where is my credit card


Just in time for the end of no nut november. I am simping so hard.


It's offical, I'm Zhongsexual.


I like how even the official media doesn’t try to hide who the geo archon is anymore🤣


Just got Childe off of pity, then Zhongli shows up and makes me regret it lol. 

Beat slaps too


TRAP MUSIC??????


.... I told myself I would save for xiao... Fuck


I’m at 73 pity and have 15.5k gems saved...praying he comes home on my pity! Good luck to everyone pulling for him tomorrow!


Holy sh-- that beat drop is SICK.


Anyone else instantly recognize the storyteller's voice at the beginning as Jeralt?


[deleted]


I'm so sad. I stopped using the banner on the 74th wish to save up for Zhongli and then, one day, accidentally went into the wrong banner and got a 5*.


I guessed he used a spear


He spoke these words: “em huh hoi te”


Soooo Zhongli is Rex Lapis, right?


The meteor scene gives me madara vibes


I won't lie, I'm fully erect


𒆙 -----------


Is it just me or does Zhongli feel like a support character rather than DPS? Mihoyo kitted him with Noblesse in his story quest seems to indicate so.

He can put up shields consistently for a long time. Building him with Retracing Bolide seems to be the way to go for DPS or sub DPS.


Holy fuck I'm about to SIMP


Can anyone find the Chinese version of this video ? I am only able to find the Eng & Jap version of it.


Inserting “OH MY GOD! Ok, IT’S HAPPENING”


That beat fuckin slaps


I thought he was the archon of geo...why is his theme so **fire**?


Can you honestly blame Childe for not recognizing that he is Rex Lapis cause Childe keeps being distracted by Zhongli's full-blown sex energy.


CUM-


yoooooooooooooooooooooo this demo might be the best one!!!!


this beat goes HARD


My heart is racing just by watching this game's character trailers.. and the music. Oooh boi
I'm not even pulling for him 🤣


He’s so coooool!!

Daddy with a capital D


That beat was a banger


I was really trying to NOT pull him.

Goddamnit MHY with bomb ass demo videos


the spear looks so good on him makes me want it ;_;


wtf these video edits and the beat are clean AF


The goddamn marketing...


DAYUMMNNNN they stepped it up with this gameplay trailer. That was so hype with the Liyue trap beats and all lol


i feel like i'm drawing ever closer to eating my shoes than ever getting to pull on his banner XD


I want to get him but I know I'm gonna fail my pity coinflip.


I'm not gay... BUT!


I love the English VA for Zhongli


Damn THIS is how you get people to spend money on a gacha game.


Why did this make me tear up


It's kinda weird hearing Keith Silverstein voice a non-evil character haha. (Not that it's a bad thing)


My pity will put me to 85. Please God gimme him. My girlfriend has 5 5*  I have 0. She doesn't deserve this one too


Isn’t zhongli geo? Then why is this beat so fire


Can't wait for Zhongli to team up with Venti and the traveler to beat up Baal The Boys season 2 style


He’s sexy, I approve


Can his charge attack hit a large target more than once?


Very well done trailer. If it weren't for Albedo, I'd totally roll for him.


I was saving up the pity... Now it is time for the Geo Daddy


Ooooooo boy this is what I've been saving up my primogems for a month for. 
Time to do 3 10-wishes


I believe in Zhongli supremacy


Ugh, Zhongli's so hot this trailer made him even hotter than before, and especially that ost that was playing in the background, I can't wait to pull him. Good luck to anyone who's rolling for him!


I'm gonna SIMP


Is he a dps or a caster?


I'm at 7.5k primos, 40 pulls in to pity and my last banner pull was Venti. I'm praying that I don't have to massacre my wallet and hit the 50% chance


Can I just get the song?


Now i know this could be too much to ask, but I want part of the demo here to be a summoning cutscene Q-Q


His hold E after his elemental burst is obviously no one shot guys. It probably jsut does a certain amount of dmg


Why do I get geo-Geralt vibes?

I’m in love with this demo


Not gonna lie, this is by far the best Character Demo video they've done and I would really like to see more. It's just... everything from the dialogue to the scoring to the animation are all \*chef's kiss\*

&#x200B;

I have been saving pity for Zhongli and I really am hoping beyond all hopes that I pull him the first pity I reach and at least get him to C1.


> MiHoYo

name more iconic duo

all character trailers for Honkai Impact 3 and Genshin Impact slaps hard. They know how to build up hype in those trailers


Japanese version?


0:48 CASTLE OF STONE


That soundtrack is just epic tbh. The moment he was showing and the beats kicked in. Just epic!


Watched 0:55 like five times. The editing for the video is amazing.


*Tabibito-san would you mind giving us some spare primogems*


I am man and this made me wet.


My 13 intertwined fate and 13500 primogems are ready for my archon team.


geo-daddy 🤩


I'll remember every single one of you that insisted he's a mid tier support at best


Mihoyo may be on that bullshit when it comes to the gacha aspect but goddamn they make a good fucking trailer.


This made me immediately regret getting Tartaglia


I've a question about the banner system:

On the Venti banner I got Venti 1st and then Mona 2nd, that means that the next 5\* I get on a banner is going to be a banner unit, right?

Thanks boissss!


Legend says u/ViliteAckerman is still replaying this character demo to this minute


It's on trending, nice.


I was finding Zhongli’s soundtrack. ANYONE can help please.
IT’S SO LIT. <3


Zhongli and the Exaggerated swagger of a Funeral man.


160 upvotes, as all things should be


time to whip out our wallets


I doubt we even have the resource to level him up to 50 right now, especially those day one players.


In terms of money, its already spent on Daddy Zhong


Chinese Trap Beat. Zhongli has good taste.


Forget spending money on primogems. I need to buy an ost of all these character demo tracks.


The section at 1:18 is so good


Ikr it's so good. Traditional Chinese music + modern beats. I hope there's this sound track whenever I play zhongli hee


50 upvotes and I spit a shitty miracle lyrical spiritual individual verse over it.


A Venti beat, if you will


Bruh, forget the 5 stars. We need a banner for these sick trap beats. Lmao.


Swaggy Z - Teyvat trap beat (feat. RLapuis and Morax$)


I think that might be the "rework" of his petrify. If that is true in gameplay then that honestly is on par with Venti's burst for me. Imagine petrifying multiple ruin guards (as presented in the video) and destroying them with his hold skill.


I think it's just his shield AOE damage killing them while petrified, like how frozen enemies shatter when killed.

But we never know!


Think he done his hold skill which breaks geo structures so maybe that works on enemies he petrifies? Imagine the Mona ult then zhongli ult right after...


If that's actual gameplay (albeit with exaggerated camera angles), then that kind of implies that Petrify DOES turn things into Geo element (constructs, perhaps).

That said, his Hold E doesn't shatter anymore, but just deals large damage to Geo elements.  If they made sure the enemies had low HP though, that could still happen.  Though I thought it was restricted to 2 targets, so it might just be theatrics.

Still my #1 thing to test during his story quest during the 12 hours between its launch and the Childe banner ending.


I’m dying to know the answer to this too


My hunch is it might still petrify enemies at 0 hp from the alt. So they arn't enemies anymore just a leftover statue making them a geo construct


Hilichurls: petrified

Wombs: shattered


I'm pretty sure that was just the petrification end animation, and they timed it with the shield blast.


I think that's just a death animation due to the petrify. It could also be a Shatter-type reaction that killed them and that's why they left no body.


C6 Zhongli


My guess is that it’s just theatric. His hold E skill does says they it “drains a large amount of geo element” but it also says from a maximum of 2 targets. Maybe, just maybe, his hold E does big damage to petrified enemies, but no way it’s like in the trailer.


Are you seriously asking if they gave him an instant kill combo?


The phrase he says in the Chinese version is more literary sounding, something like "as the heavens move so do everything below." It's mildly amusing to me that if Fishcl said something to that tone it would be viewed as [chunibyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%ABniby%C5%8D) but since Zhongli is a god we all love it.


Umbridge ruins that line for me :(


He's probably thinking what to have for lunch later with the 500 mora he just found


One of the youtube comments saying that those are wishes trying to get at him had me rolling lmao.

sameee, I had no intention to pull for him with my *almost pity,* but I changed my mind :((


Seriously I think this is the best Genshin teaser/preview to date.  No contest. It's absolutely beautiful.


The music ramping up during his combat showcase culminating in the fights on the clouds is FIRE!


Not gay enough. Need to watch it moaaar


His enemies aren't the only ones getting rock hard


Ha! Be at my level and watch this 270 times


lmao same genshin has been my only interaction for a month now and I'm seriously curving


I BELIEVE IN ZHONGLI SUPREMACY


Lmao, caught me off guard with that one.


He should kick me in the ass like fr


The target or the spear?


Isn't this ripped straight from a YT comment?


That voice is just so heavenly


I'm as straight as can be and he makes me question myself


flair checks out


[While watchin the character demo](https://i.imgur.com/CV5p5yQ.png)


My heterosexuality levels have gone to over 9000!


The entire video was sexy. All of these character demos are so good but Zhongli has the most stylistic editing by far (tbf there's only like 3 others though...)


this whole demo was dope af. It's the best one by far I feel


Please tell me that means he can just shatter petrified enemies with his E....


His voice is audiobook/NatGeo documentary worthy.


god im usually a JP elitist and even like tomoaki maeno but zhonglis english voice is SO good i actually prefer it over the other languages.


Zhongli's voice makes me wish they would let you pick a language for every character lol. I usually like their Chinese voices but Zhongli's English VA is so damn good at his job.


Rolling for Zhongli just because of his voice. Other things about him are just a plus.


Are you implying torbjorn isn’t the sexiest character ever


There's so many cool things in Chinese that lose meaning in the english translation. Everyone should learn Chinese!


They sounded quite different, EN sounds like more of a imponent father, CN sounds more to a calm god unimpressive to the enemies his facing. And JP sounds like a overpowered dude with a cool personality. The best is all the versions actually fits zhongli personality.


and korean it’s similar “the sky moves/controls all things” ^_^


Out of curiosity, where do you get "earth trembles" out of that, is that just from 万象? I initially thought it was something like "Heaven moves/controls all beings" just as a more literal translation, but my Chinese is shit and yours' is clearly much better lol


Localization issues, I suppose. What is four characters in chinese will take far more syllables to say in english.

Meaning aside though, the delivery for Eng is far cooler than JP/CN. JP/CN version of the ult is delivered calmly like any other voiceline, while EN actually has the weight you'd expect from an ult.


Finally!! I collected all his mats and hoarded mora and everything😭  

Dragging him home no matter what lol


Zhongli: *meow*


Me: pspsps, Zhongli~

Zhongli: *runs away*

Me: Come back here and take my primogems dammit!


[deleted]


My only complaint is that they didn't have a smooth transition to his animated character pull art like the other Character Demos did.

But I'm a sucker for the ink effects - holy shit this is my favorite trailer.


Definitely. From the music to animation, we can see a lot of time and budget is spent on this demo. Especially the frame transition between the fighting scene and the normal scene. Oh glob my husband deserves everything!!!


20k F2P Primo?! Did you not wish on any of the recent banners?


I think Childe's character demo was of a similar quality. Personally, I thought Childe's was a lot cooler, but I fuck w/ the music in this trailer a lot. That's some snazzy sounding OST and I hope both their trailer OSTs are put on spotify alongside the new boss OST and that banger that plays during Childe's story mission.


Shit I didn't know Zhongli talks in such a scholarly way in Chinese. it's beautiful. 

I'm a native Chinese speaker and I don't really understand what he's saying it's too profound for me 🤣😅


They somehow made him sound the best in all 3 languages lmao


Yo he sounds sexy in every voice, you can clearly see the love they gave to Zhongli


I'm amazed at how the English VO big dick knocked it out of the part with his deeeep voice.

For me it's:

- English 


- Japanese



- Chinese


You and me both, hahah. All the videos are so epic or sweet!


Aye you and me both!


Oh my


Yes I do the cooking

Yes I do the cleaning

Yes I keep the nana real sweet for your eating

Yes you be the boss yes I be respecting


I'd do that, and I'm a guy.


I would love to do that to if I could marry him.


Sounds like we had the same plan ;o;


hi ben


Gotta look good for daddy Zhong


Shen in League of Legends, Shido in P5... he voices so many awesome characters!


His VA in English really is top notch


I was lucky to meet him a few years ago. He’s SUPER nice, and he does such amazing work!


What if Xiao's banner is just as cool, if not cooler? Prepare your wallet.


There's a soft pity at 75~. Better save your gems. I pulled thinking there's no way I'll get a 5* and ended up getting Tartagila at 76th.


I'm 64 pulls in the Childe banner (didn't get childe thanksfully, got all 3 4* which is what I wanted). I have around 50 pulls now, and the next 5* will be 50/50. I will be happy if it's Qiqi, Jean or Zhongli, OK with Mona and Keqing, but will be very disappointed with Diluc (Already got Klee).

Bless RNG for Geo Daddy to come home.


Same I'm at around 75 pulls so far, so I'll have the 50/50. Pls give me Zhong


Same here, I stopped at 70 on the Childe banner because of the soft pity! 50/50 shot for Zhongli, c'mon home pleeease


16 rolls off 100% pity. Tomorrow can't come soon enough. Skipped klee and childe, finally happy to spend the primos :D


The final contract is revealed in the main story or as the chapter pv puts it >!the contract to end all comtracts!<


Woah how’d you rack up 16k promos from farming?


Dude, I didn't even make that connection til I show this! That's awesome


You mean Kenpachi Zaraki? Yeah, that voice (David Lodge) is so distinctive. It's kind of a shame he doesn't get to play a big character but I guess if they can keep bringing him in as the storyteller and random other narration npcs (Fis Event Explorer who made the wings) then we'll keep hearing from him.


Thank you! I really hope I can get Zhongli on my first pity with my limited amount of primogems!

Best of luck on getting Zhongli, too! 🥰


At least no matter what you'll get a 5 star character, hope you get what you want.


My first 5 star was skyward spine on perma banner. Hope this is fate set up by rex lapis


Kind of funny, I joined for the waifus but ended up with a husbando team.


And Kenpachi Zaraki from Bleach. Yes.


Probably around 30 hours-ish.


You can check your ingame notice, it will show you your local time.

Asia server will have his banner in around 32 hour.


For the time being I still rate the EN one, but I'm keen to hear the CN version too.


Who dictate that cool characters cannot be support?


Uh oh


Technically no, if the leaks on honeyhunter are correct then it isn't false advertising. Just very good camera capturing moments.

It just has to deal enough damage to kill them in one go as you said and that's what the visual effect would look like if they were killed while petrified. It's the same as a mob dying while Frozen they vanish in a puff of smoke rather than their usual disintegrate animation.


I got tartaglia before i hit soft-pity rolling for ning. I'm gonna blow $100 out of my $500 christmas bonus. fuck it.


Same here


really wish the banners overlapped for a day. had to decide between the two of them and i was afraid of regretting not getting tartaglia so i rolled for him, now i feel like itll be the other way around and ill regret not waiting for zhongli instead


Iirc his c1 let's you put 2 constructs down


It is on Bilibili here: https://b23.tv/dfHztt


you could say it rocks


yet


you could say it rocks

clowns will be clowns. every archon has a crazy mechanic to them and i love it. this guy is def a tank dps


The best is always the next


Yup


Maybe Mihoyo is just following in the steps of Riot and becoming a music company, because holy shit this straight fire


Yeah, its a >!Gacha Trap!< beat.


The instrument they used is most likely an erhu, if anyone is interested. Commonly known as Ancient Civilization’s electric guitar.


I particularly like the 1.1 A New Star Approaches trailer use of music and the edits are really good.


Costs $5 per roll, 0.2% chance to get a 5 star track. 

At a 100 roll pity there is a 50/50 chance to get featured track or a 1 hr video of benny’s adventure on repeat.


I'm literally jamming to that drop omgggg


What does your flair say?


Man... If that's what the rework is. Oh boy oh boy, my wallet isn't ready.


There's no way that was anything but trailer magic lol. He'd have a huge aoe instant death every 12 seconds if it were real.


It kind of made me wonder if maybe petrified enemies count as geo constructs, so long they're still petrified. If so, that would be a pretty cool and fair rework.


I feel it’s more of an execution. For example, pertrified enemies whose health are below a certain % get executed when Zhonglj uses his E. Otherwise it would be too OP.


It probably just looks like they shatter if the damage is enough to kill them. Otherwise it probably just releases them from petrify with some cracking off effects.


i dont think he can one shot shield but if it can thats op af


I dunno about any rework, but I know for sure that those aren't petrified mobs -- they're pure primogems, and that was zhongli nomming all of them straight from our wallets..

And for some reason I don't mind one bit.


since his skill page released last week, I've been guessing that petrified enemies will be considered as geo constructs and his hold-skill will probably pop them for extra dmg. don't think it's an insta kill

here's hoping that's the case.


I rewatched and his skill came out too late for it to have been a part of the skill. If you look again they explode before the animation "starts up".


the camera zooms in when he goes for the held e explosion, I think its probably he explodes smaller enemies when they are petrified but larger enemies are left intact, and perhaps take damage similar to mona's. Still strong but not busted.


I think he should be as strong as Venti. And I think Venti has by far been the most powerful of the character banner 5*’s.


I doubt that will happen. At best case we will be able to deal dmg to them instead of completely one shotting them. Imagine how much content would that trivialize, especially in Abyss. The cd is also 20s and energy requirement is 40. Yeah, no way.


I would laugh hard if that us his C6...


Let me get this strait, so he's a fusion of Madara+Thanos+Medusa?

&#x200B;

Wallet we need talk.


I'm sorry to be that person, but there's no way his ultimate can flat out kill up to any enemies that can be petrified just by holding his elemental skill afterward.

The much more likely truth is that his ultimate just 1-shot everything on screen here, and they simply die/explode after the petrify effect ends because they had no health remaining.


Would not be surprised if they literally put that in there to jebait people into thinking what I just thought. But yeah that seems more reasonable tbh. Nonetheless, looked sick.


it's probably this, there might be bonus damage on petrified enemies or something when he AOE's which would be a nice addition


If true, zero regrets saving up for him. Mona ult with zhong would be too crazy


That would be the absolute best thing that could happen. I'd love to use my two favorite characters like that


Wait it doesnt shatter anymore? Fuuuck so you're telling me Geo Traveler's garbage is gonna stay on the field *forever*?!


"large", is just 100% of his dmg.


I'll hold off judgment until I can play more of him. Mihoyo kitted him wrong though in his story. He is using a full Noblesse Oblige, but Archaic Petra or Retracing Bolide would have been a better DPS showcase. Though, I am thinking Mihoyo kitting him with Noblesse means they designed Zhongli as a support.  It's impressive how long he can keep his shields up.

Bar the charged attack animation which can teleport you off a cliff, I think Zhongli would be a character to pull for.


That actually sounds reasonable. The Burst damage from the Mihoyo info makes it out to be, quote, "massive," which likely means it would oneshot most small enemies. After seeing some hilichurls and treasure hoarders survive, I wondered if they were "dead" but still petrified.


makes more sense and technically still accurate to the description since his ult does a ton of dmg


Well, make Zhongli unruin it : D have him reclaim it from that Hag lol


This is totally a DBZ Abridged moment. "Should I send them wine? A gift basket? Gift baskets WITH wine"


*— or with the 500 mora he's about to harvest from their souls*


So you're saying his shield is nearly impossible to break....


They might not be wrong


I watched their Honkai ads when I didn't even know the game. Their animation game is top tier


I think big name companies that make F2P games have a massive marketing/animation department. In League of Legends people joke about how Riot is really a music company because of the sick songs they put out to sell skins. Mihoyo seems to be doing something similar and I would expect them to up the game when they eventually release skins


The game is just a front. Mihoyo truly is an animation company just waiting to take over Disney


Yeah I was gonna say the Klee video with the music and the cinematography was PERFECT! It had Klee written ALL over it xD


https://youtu.be/Tlnx_Q1GzNg

If anyone hasn't seen The Canipa Effect's video on Mihoyo as a studio, totally worth watching.


Without mora, I'm guessing he's not there as a customer...


>Given that the Pearl Galley is heavily implied to be a brothel

When?


He has his spear and monolith, maybe it's a part time job during his transition, I won't judge.


lmao and hes in the stage to what? perform?


Zhongli - Stoic as a rock; and twice as hard ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


Someone do the math (for the lolz)


This type of comment is very common in any type of video featuring a handsome guy, it isn't the most original idea


Sure is


Keith Silverstein is the voice actor. Also the voice of Torbjorn from Overwatch


Should watch Dorohedoro, he voices the villain.


A bro can respect a bro for being suave af, it’s all good


Yeah I used my pity on Childe and I'm lowkey regretting it now


There's 12 character demos actually


Most likely it's just he killed the enemies while they are still petrified


Imagine watching a cutscene and the characters just deadass start talking to each other in different languages


Character-specific language options would be such a blessing.  I generally adore the English dub, but *holy moly Klee just stop speaking forever, ugh.*


This can be said of almost any language. It's always better to fully understand the originals than to have to settle for a translation.

That said, I find the english translation in Genshin remarkably good anyway.


Dude the Chinese that ZhongLi and the adepti speak are so archaic and complicated that I have to download a dictionary. Genshin Impact motivated me to learn my mother tongue lol.


Good luck spending the next 10+ years trying to unravel the mysteries of Chinese 😅 It's a brutally difficult language


To preface, Mihoyo likes to make up idioms so its really up to the reader's interpretation. This is simply an interpretation I like, but I'm sure there are other people with a better grasp of it.

To my knowledge 天动万象 is not a classical idiom, so there is no classical definition. Please anyone who is more knowledgeable feel free to correct me I have not done any research.

you can think of 天 as the highest position - the emperor, as well as the celestial bodies in motion 天动 which is a clear allusion to the heavens and the notion that heaven is constant, perpetual, always in motion.

From that idea, its clear how the world/earth/(maybe you can think of it as subjects with reference to the emperor) moves only when the heaven moves, it establishes Zhongli's authority over Liyue though that is much diminished after 1.1.

In this case I think of 象 as follow rather than imitate.

I won't speak much about his fall from authority as it is a major spoiler and what I believe to be an overarching theme in this whole storyline but we do know that he once held the highest position - the only individual capable of making mora.

Hence by combining the reverent theme in this interpretation, you can think of it almost as if zhongli holds this control in his palm - the celestial bodies/facets of the universe line up with his will.

However, going along this train of thought is unpoetic to me as it boils down to how 'the world listens to Zhongli's orders' in a sense, which I think clashes with his character as a impartial, fair archon.

Hence, I choose to remove that sense of personal responsibility and defer to autonomous control; the laws of the universe, where **everything has its own laws** to follow. This removes zhongli from the picture but asserts that he has some degree of influence in this power.

**So we paint a picture of the mysterious heavens - the celestial bodies in motion, zhongli directs the universal contract, and the world follows, trembling in reverence.**


Whats his character ascension material?


[Cat Zhongli](https://i.imgur.com/N3HdxmL.png)


I want Klee's track. Seems pretty fun.


Childe's transition was perfection.


ever since i saw his art i wondered how they would do the transition, but then Mihoyo is just like "we wont" ): i still loved it in its own way though


Yeah the ink and shadow effects got me real good. I was watching it and just thought, "k I'm all in"...


17K primo + 66 unlucky streak  here

Didn't pull Venti, didn't want Klee or Childe. So now I'm just waiting for either Zhongli or Ganyu


Nope. Been saving since I started!


As someone who speaks Chinese... Definitely gonna switch the game to Chinese mode if I get Zhongli. Talk classical Chinese to me daddy.


Yo can you please tell me what his ult line “tian dong wan xiang” means? It’s gibberish in Google Translate.


His voice is so silky smooth in Chinese. I love it


Zhongli's chinese VA is one of the ?audio directors at Mihoyo

Same with Jean's chinese VA


For me Japanese first, then English close by.

Chinese is too different to other two to compare, more profound.


Same


and Nazeem


and Torbjorn in Overwatch... wait wat?


Ohhh he's shen? That explains so much for me now. As someone who spammed shen jungle after Spica played it I'm so excited lol


Saving for Xiao here will be so ready


Dude I was summoning on the weapon banner to also try get his spear last night and accidentally done a summon on Childes banner I was shitting myself until I seen it was just a 3*, would’ve been so mad at myself


May the Diluc not be with you.


We know that but what we want to know is signora's side of the deal


Haha. The farming was for all his ascension stuff and leylines. The 16k primos is from spending nothing since Venti banner and hoarding like a dragon. If primos were farmable I would have way less of a life and way more primos.


I recognized him from FE:Three Houses and Persona 5. Very distinctive voice. Wouldn't be shocked if he got to voice a character eventually.


The male characters in Genshin just hit different.


CN version: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hD4y1X7Rm?from=search&seid=14475463919009424303](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hD4y1X7Rm?from=search&seid=14475463919009424303)


Thanks a lot ClumsyLi! Much appreciated !😆. Hope you get to pull him on your first 5 pulls if you’re pulling for him !

They have a music label called HoyoMix. They're actually quite a popular company in China, they also have an animation branch


Their music from Honkai Impact is good too.  
This is the best compilation I could find.    
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FHX4IW2518&ab\_channel=Thienji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FHX4IW2518&ab_channel=Thienji)


Honkai impact also have sick trailer music recently especially those videos with osts for a featurrd valk/herschers.


You gotta roll to get the beat... otherwise you get a 3star version missing instruments. I heard the 4 star still has the bass line so that’s something.


goddamn right.


Meteor drops with the beat. **\*chef's kiss\***


It's zhongli's line in his Chinese trailer. The English version translated it pretty well: I wish not for dominion, yet I cannot watch the common folk suffer.

I just find the Chinese version a lot more poetic xP

Edit: a more literal transation is: *Although I have no intention to chase the deer, but I understand the pain of common folk.* "Chase the deer" is an ancient way to say fight for the throne. But in modern days it means to dominate, so the English video's translation is correct too.


[deleted]


I'm at 60th roll now and I can roll 20 rn, I'm saving for daddy


I want to refund my childe


Yeah I think it might be possible that he kills "small" enemies and does a lot of dmg to big enemies (?). Like Mona's ult, but that still makes it a lot stronger than what we were thinking goddamn I love him anyways lol


Most definitely isn't an instant kill, might do significant amounts of damage to petrified units though. Time will tell I suppose.  


His E is after all the crux of his entire kit pretty much.


Yeah I HIGHLY doubt that it's an insta-kill. That's busted even if it works only on 2 people. Probably/hopefully a lot of extra damage though.


Said that to Venti EM spamming fucking tornadoes everywhere. 

Small mobs can't get alive out of there. Big mobs get fucked but at least they have a bit of health


>There's no way that was anything but trailer magic lol.

As someone who comes from Destiny: this.

Things will look grossly OP in trailers, especially regarding PvP, but that's because they're not showing that the players' have like a sliver of HP left, so when you see the guy in the trailer pop off w/ an easy triple... yeah, because of that.

Makes for a dope trailer shot tho.


It probably just does damage and if the damage is enough to kill them it explodes.


He'd be able to clear a wave of fatui enemies with just 40 energy. Do it two times, and that's one chamber done. Lol


If you fight him as a boss, then his E will instant kill you if you get petrified. As a playable character? No way !


his e can only drain 2 targets remember? so i think he can do it to two enemies


With any luck, the "trailer magic" is just removing the damage numbers.


It was leaked as such at one point, but then when his kit was revealed and didn't mention it people tried to say it was removed.  But most didn't account that it might've been baked into Petrify's status effect rather than Zhongli's inherent abilities.


Would be insane if his pillar could resonate on petrified enemies like they are geo constructs


This is the more logical approach. Small mobs below 30%hp gets destroyed while petrified.  Big mobs/bosses 15%-10%


Most likely it is just damage and if the damage would kill them they explode.


He can destroy 2 small Geo shield at most, but probably deal a huge chunk of dmg to big shield and stone hilichurl.


Well the datamined aoe of his hold E is anemic dmg. The benefit was more about breaking (like physical shields)/absorbing geo from 2 enemies, and creating his shield. It would technically absorb geo shield (fatui kind) too, but that's just one type right?

Even if they made his ult turn them to geo temporarily, it would likely be limited to 2 enemies being damaged/killed by his hold E. I'd love to be wrong and it has no limit, and breaks shields.


> Mona ult with zhong would be too crazy

The 0 Mora team


Mona and Zhong in the same team is genuinely the best of both worlds, gonna be so much fun using them together! Hopefully everyone who summons gets him if they’re after him, he looks so fun to use


Well, the description says "explodes", so it might get blown up.  I meant more in the way others are saying it might be an insta-kill like you'd see in some anime.  Definitely won't be that based on the description.


So in that case do u think the petrified enemies will be counted as geo constructs?


My wallet is Abyss 12!


They’ve been practicing with hi3 for 4 years now. They’ve got this stuff on lock


yeah and the movements seems so natural. and that must be difficult to pull off with all the weird fast movements


All the thirsty players here will be his patreon lol

Video is 115 seconds = 0.032 hours long

Now, 270 x 0.032 = 8.64 hours

The [video](https://youtu.be/4oBpaBEMBIM) was released 5 hours ago.

You sir have just lied.


Don't forget Nazeem

  


"Do you get to the Yujing Terrace very often? Oh what am I saying, of course you don't"


Come join the accidentally used pity to pull Childe while saving for Zhongli club.


don't worry. we have Zhongli's wallet as a hostage


That sounds like Tekken


yes, I think the way they translated adepti, childe, and favonius are actually quite smart and still maintaining the original meaning while being more in-line in english speaking lore.


>This can be said of almost any language.

But especially for Chinese because Chinese is a very complex language. There are so many 4 word "combos" in Chinese that can't be translated to english without using a long ass sentence


I see, that makes a lot of sense. I'd assumed there was some level of artistic interpretation here, and it's really interesting to see your reasoning behind it!


geo boss drop, slime drop, cor lapis


Sir, take my upvote.


Broke ass F2P here after blowing 67 wishes on Childe banner and not getting him. On the bright side I got Beidou upto C3! 

Not sure if Zhongli will work for my team but I'll end up getting him anyway since I'll be pulling for Xinyan.


Never thought I’d ever hear that last sentence in my life, it’s 5am and I’m laughing uncontrollably in bed, thank you kind stranger


>“when the heaven moves the whole earth trembles


wtf multitalented motherfuckers


Do you get to the Golden House very often? Oh, what am I saying? of course you don't.


Also char aznable from gundam origin


**AARDVARK PAYS OFF!**


Lol


Your last sentence describes me way too much. GG my guy. Good luck


Oh my god that voice


Not quite the same but you might like this if that one did it for ya 

https://youtu.be/0mabfyYaXww


A game company with a music label and an animation studio, this is the future of video games I guess.


That's gonna be my new workout music


Even with the very little that I learnt, it was clear to me that Chinese is greatly oriented towards poetry.


I remember seeing fatui skirmishers being petrified on 1.1 reveal livestream. I guess we'll find it out tomorrow if they petrified while they still have shield.


Even if it is only limited to 2 targets, still dope. At least it would be better than what people speculating that petrify is simply a "frozen effect". 

Someone also mentioned "recent chinese leaks" says that his E press ability can also resonate with all the petrified enemies.

So basically.. E press to drop the pillar if there is a whole bunch of petrified enemies... E hold if there are only 1 or 2 elite enemies around to outright destroy them.

Curious about how it will react with elemental shields too. Worst case scenario just bring a kaeya/barbara/amber to break those elemental shields before proceeding to nuke those fatui asses with Zhong


Yeah I agree as this seems to be the case gameplay wise. After the petrification part the video then focused on Zhongli in front of the regular mobs (instead of the ruin guard that was petrified as well) that were instantly destroyed with his hold skill. But I guess we'll have to see it for ourselves once he is released. I'm still pulling for him regardless lol


Aka Symmetry in the Dawn trailer and likely Hawkmoon in the Hunt trailer


if so Zhongli would be busted on deep abyss floors


mona and venti can cc small enemy but i want zhongli mostly cause he can cc big enemy


Mona and Zhong in the same team will be good for about three days.

Then they starve to death.


Truuueee, make enemies QQ with your QQ's


Maybe something like "every x amount of petrified enemies" count as 1 geo construct, depending on how his E scales with constructs.


Zhongli too broken, he's hotter than a Pyro character and makes people wetter than a Hydro character

How can someone be 3 elements at once?!


There's two kinds of people in this world:

Those who see Pearl Galley as a brothel and those who see Pearl Galley as a casino. In reality, it's both, but the real question is what does Chaoxi see it as?


I hit Childe on the 59th pull trying to get Ningguang (still no Ningguang) and reset my pity, now I only have enough for the 50/50 chance to get Zhongli and I'm gonna cry


Well, I would say childe might be a bad example here, since they didn't manage to have it come across as a title (in the sense of signora, the fair lady) rather than a name. but in general yea, i agree, it's been fairly decent


This works, though to be more exact 万象 (wan xiang) refers to everything. Or rather, every phenomenon / manifestation on Earth, not just the earth alone.


https://youtu.be/5hwBgD_gnN8


CN voice of Zhongli is also the Voice Director for Genshin Impact CN


That's a lot of reasonably successful Chinese companies, really. They get some cash and then they start diversifying immediately into adjacent industries.


Yeah poetry and idioms.   
All of em are examinable, while it's amusing to see in game, its torture in exams.


[deleted]


The question isn't whether he petrified them cause he def should. But whether he changes their shields into geo.


Geo Damage maybe much more fun to build


I highly doubt it'd just outright destroy them that'd be way too good, however I wouldn't be surprised if it does do massive geo damage.


Yeah pulling for him regardless of whether his E destroy all or just 2 enemies when they are petrified.

After all, the title of the video is called "Character demo - Zhongli".. and the last time I checked the dictionary on what "demo" means.

>a demonstration of a product or technique.

> demonstrate the capabilities of (software or another product).
>"Apple is expected to demo the newest version of its mobile operating system at the conference next week"

So yeah.. Fingers crossed that it works as such even if it is exaggerated to explode all petrified enemies, I'd be happy even if it is just two enemies.


Or like stasis in the beyond light trailers. Oh wait....


*cof cof*
venti ulti Flashbacks


and blow your wallet harder than anemo char XD


errm... pyro?


It's not a casino. The activities are explicitly stated to be illegal, but they are advertised as a casino on a bulletin board where all ads have to pass through the millelith first. That means that Gambling has to be legal in Liyue, which implies that the ship is a brothel


Childe was used as a title, not a name, so it works in a really subtle way masking it as a name to people who are not used to the medieval term.


Hold up, his name *isn't* Childe Tartaglia?


Venti also warps the meta somewhat. In my experience any domain with venti becomes a fucking brainless slog where you just throw everything you've got into his swirling vortex of doom

If anyone else deserves to warp the meta, it has to be Zhongli


Yep. If this shit works like how it seems in the vid I will start pulling on his banner ASAP.


As the  >!Geo Archon!< , rightfully so!


tbf, outside of the Warlock melee and Hunter super, Stasis isn't nearly as OP as was implied in the trailer.


Air... Water... Fire... Earth

Zhongli is the Avatar


sorry my brain MELTED


haha, if you're serious, his real name is Ajax, harbinger title Tartaglia, and Childe is sorta like an alias, but also like a kind of subtitle I suppose. like how "the fair lady" is subtitle for La Signora. Childe itself means something like young lord.


They're both Archons so It would be fitting.


Yep. Venti is pay to win, if you compare it with everything else. No unga bunga hero can beat how useful his Burst is.


Venti and Qiqi, the king and queen of literally any domain. All mechanics get completely ignored


Archon meta. I am very excited for this release. My goal is to have a full archon team. Can't wait


I shudder the thought of when they release pyro archon. This game meta might be fucked


He’s a former archon... he should.


I'm pretty sure whoever watched the demo already knows who Zhongli is. No need to cover it anymore.


>his real name is Ajax

***Deadpool presses X for doubt***


This, with venti it's just everyone throw everything here and it's done, with. Qiqi it doesn't matter if the domain punishes electro users, she outheals most dmg sources


#YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO GET ME GOING MWAHAHAHAHA

*idk if you get the reference lol*


The in-game clock that people are referring to doesn't tell you the actual time you spend playing the game. It pauses when you check the map (which you will do very often) and when you die (which you will do very often) it'll reset back to what it was before you died.

My current playtime is clocked at around 8 hours according to the game, but my Switch itself says I've been playing for "15 hours or more". I'm still not finished with it, though I'm getting close to the end. I wouldn't worry about length.


The demo really was a blast and I'm very inclined to buy the game.

Questions:

1) You don't get to carry over any kind of progress in the demo, into the full game, right?

2) The first sections in the game are identical to the demo, right?

Which means I will essentially have to repeat everything I've done in the demo (which is not necessarily a bad thing).

3) How much of the full game is presented in the demo, in terms of length? 20%? Or less?


I bought dragon quest because of the excellent demo

I have not bought some others that I thought I would enjoy but after playing the demo realized it wasn't for me

So I guess demos go both ways


The problem is that demos are a double-edged sword. Sometimes a person trying the game out causes them to not buy it, resulting in a loss in sales whereas they may have stuck with it if they already spent their money. It's consumer-friendly sure, but not always business-friendly.


If anything, devs releasing a demo tells you more about their mindset than whether the game will work or not. Releasing a demo means you're somewhat confident you produced the game you set out to make. Whether people will like it is really up in the air and demos are not obviously beneficial in helping sales.


This is why I love my cities library. They have switch games. And a library card is free. They even have a setup online to let you “hold” a copy of a game when it becomes available, and they’ll send it to your closest location (or location of your choice). You also have 3 weeks until you gotta return them, so this give both my wife and I a chance to play and complete a game. I’m currently playing Pokémon Snap and Mario Golf. Sure I waited a bit, but it’s money I’m saving for an experience I’m loving. In the end. Bring back video game rental stores.


Even if someone doesn’t end up buying Dread after playing the demo, I think Nintendo is playing the long game with the Metroid IP (finally).  They want as many people as possible to be exposed to it, ahead of whatever future plans they have for it.  I think Nintendo has access to SEO, etc and is finally more aware of how much untapped potential they have with the IP.


Thing is, apparently demos don’t actually make any significant difference to the number of games sold.


This was easily the best demo Nintendo has put out in years, if not EVER in my opinion. Whereas most other demos even during the 3ds era felt super limited or barely gave you anything to get hooked, they gave us basically 10% of the game for FREE. NO LIMITS. Just here ya go, play the game and eventually we’ll just stop you, that’s how a demo should be good damn job Nintendo. You needed a W after Switch Online lol


Double edged sword. A demo convinces me not to buy more often than not. So for me demos are great. For the company well they've lost lost of my money


Demo one hundred percent sold me the game tbh


The game is only 10 hours but I’m 3 hours in and I’ve probably aged a year from raging. The game is fair but not easy.


For what it’s worth I think Metroid Dread’s map size is about the same as Hollow Knight, maybe bigger. Samus moves insanely fast even without upgrades so you traverse ground quicker.


I get the length thing, but there are so many 3D AAA games that last 10-15 hours but nobody complains. Is it cause this is 2D, so seemingly is less "worth it"? There's also lots of comparisons to Hollow Knight and while I have 55 hours in that game, not a single hour was more fun than Dread. Not to mention the production values are far lower, etc. I think people judge Dread in a bizarre way.


I totally agree: I had my doubts about buying the game and after 3 minutes of playing the demo I just delete the game. Saved me 60$.


Anyone remember when demo and shareware versions were the norm?


Took an hour to get used to the controls, since I'm a huge Super Metroid fan.  But after that, I've been enjoying the heck out of the game and having a blast.  So far, its my Game of the Year.


I had no idea about a game called dragon quest builders 2 but decided to try the demo. I fell in love with the game and ended up buying it based on the very meaty demo. I highly agree with what you are saying here. I never would have even thought about dragon quest builders two because I had just never heard about it before I tried the demo


I wish demos were still more standard, I remember the Xbox 360 days where the store was loaded with demos, it was like free samples at costco but for video games


I think my experience with it shows why they won't release demos for games that will sell well regardless. I really disliked the EMMI-mechanic, and decided I'll skip this one in favour of SMT5 and the new Pokeon remakes. I was already inclined to buy it, because I love metroidvanias, but don't think this one is for me after trying it.


The problem is that some study almost ten years ago suggested that game demos can have a detrimental impact of game sales. Since then the amount of demos being released, especially by larger publishers, has practically ceased. 

https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-demos-can-hurt-sales-suggests-research/1100-6410863/


All Metroid games are short. But they're really fun and really well made.


I would have loved the demo, because by all accounts (I love just about every Metroidvania, but have never played a Metroid) I should have liked Metroid Dread. I bought it, and ended up not really liking it at all, and a demo would have saved me that purchase.


Funny because after I played the demo I didn't want to buy the game anymore because the Emmis were too annoying.


This made me nostalgic for the days when you'd get PSone demo discs from gaming magazines and there would be like 6 games on it..


£50? This game is £31.99 at Curry’s (with a discount code) if anyone is interested


Thanks, the demo.  Now im sure it’s not the right game for me and i wont buy it.


I downloaded the demo for the Neo World Ends With You game this week. Great demo and progress transfers over, it’s pretty much sold me on the game! I wish more games had demos like that.


If anyone plays Tetris 99, don’t forget to do the Metroid cup this weekend for the theme.


I was gonna buy the game anyways but i wasn't sure if it was gonna be worth my money

this demo confirmed it, IT'S INCREDIBLE!!!


i'm glad there was a demo, very tempted to get this game with all the hype but i dont think it's for me. i died like 5 times in the first 20min. going back to ocarina of time


Then there are the outliers like me. It was because I played the demo that I decided not to buy it. Had there not been one, I probably would have bought it.


This was me with the Zelda game that puts you against hoards of enemies ( can't remember the name). The idea of going from a chill exploration game in breath of the wild to a game focussed on massive hack and slash battles put me off. Then I played the demo; and subsequently had to buy the full game. When you have to spend £50+ for a game, demos are the best way to make sure you like it before you spend all that money.


Well, for me it's the other way around.

I had it pre ordered, but cancelled a few days ahead of the drop because of money reasons.

The demo was a god send, so booted it up today.

I like the movement and combat, and the style, but Jesus christ, I honestly can't cope with the EMMI hunts.

After running into EMMI #2 2 times, I had to stop playing because of, Well, the dread 😂

That's how I realised it simply wasn't for me haha, so I'll be investing the money into GTA or Pokémon instead.

Still, happy we got a demo, and hope this is a trend that Will persevere!


Maybe beating a dead horse here, the idea of it being an "8-10 hour game" is very misleading for two reasons:

The game keeps a timer of *forward progress.* So that's not counting deaths, or time spent looking at the map. When you die, it resets the timer. Kind of like how a football game is 60 minutes of playtime but lasts 3 hours.

For example, I'm about 75% of the way through the game, and my time counter is 8 hours, but I've been playing for at least 12 hours.

My second point: Replayability. I can see myself starting this phenomenal game over almost immediately, I want to see if I can use different strategies and paths, and cut down my time.

Only a hardcore Metroid fan will be able to beat this in 8-10 hours of actual playtime. I feel like the criticisms for it being short are from people that are just *too* good at games like this. It doesn't feel thin to me at all.


I know this isn’t Nintendo related but this is why I love Gamepass so much. It takes away the risk of getting burned buying games I don’t like. Instead I download a game try it and either like it and play it or dislike it, remove it off my hard drive and move on. I have experienced so many games, indie and high end, that I never would have tried without Gamepass but ended up loving the experience. Currently getting lost in The Forgotten City right now and I would probably have never spent money on it if it hadn’t been on Gamepass.


What do ya mean ya bought a couple vouchers??


I didn’t realise there was a dread demo. Hmm I guess I’ll try it out then. Never been a massive fan of Metroid, but I had fun playing the pinball game on my DS lite.


I played the Demo and like it, a lot. The graphics and the controls, as you said feel so good. My only problem is difficulty. This style of games are not my forte, Ori for example I find it difficult and the same for Hollow Knight. I've heard people spending more than 5hs in the last boss. That is something that I know I won't enjoy. 
What do you think about the difficulty?


Dragon quest 11 has an amazing demo too. Its almost 20 hours of story and all progress carries over!


Alright so I sorta played a demo and ended up liking the game to the point where I wanna buy it.

But by demo I really mean that I randomly stumbled across a download link 5 days before release and didn't think it was real. So I tested it and it was totally real. 

Cool game. Didn't really think I'd enjoy it that much. This is why you have demos to test games, and it worked great in my case.


Back in the Xbox 360 almost every game had a demo. Xbox Live Arcade Games all of them had demos and the Xbox 360 indie games also all had demos.

I don't know why demos stopped being mainstream nowadays, it's pretty rare when a game has a demo now...

I personally don't like demos very much, because from my experience most of them are like "ok i'm gonna end your fun righ now, if you want to continue buy the game... waift you don't have any money, well too bad". It always made me feel bad so I avoided playing demos altogether but I ended playing a little bit of Dread's demo

Now regarding Dread's demo, since I just wanted to play the game, I think the demo shouldn't have had that very long intro it had, especially because I don't know much about Metroid's lore (I only played Super Metroid, I didn't even played Fusion which's supposedly this game's prequel)


Bear in mind that Metroid games are notoriously speedran. They’re designed for it!


Remember the days of shareware?

I miss those days.


Demos can be huge. This year I've purchased both WarioWare and Voice of the Cards because of the demos. I had no interest in either upon announcement but after playing their demos I really enjoyed them and bought both on release.


I am a couple hours into Children of Morta thanks to randomly picking up the demo and having fun with it...same with God Eater 3.

A few games ive done the demo and not bought but overall demos definitely drive sales imo


I'm going to have to try the demo. Thanks to demos I bought Dragon Quest XI S and Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity. Demo's are always a great idea.


I bought the DQ Builders 2 game because of the demo.


I kinda wish demos where more of a thing nowadays.


Dragon quest 11 demo was like 10hrs of gameplay


I feel the same way about Warioware. I was unsure if I was going to enjoy it as much as I did the Wii one as a kid and boy, it's a blast.


> I was extremely hesitant about spending £50 on a short game  

To be fair, the in game time played isnt at all accurate. Mine says I  beat it at 13 hours, but I spent about 30 playing. It pauses whenever you are in a menu, looking at the map, reading, standing still, and it resets everytime you die, or retry a boss fight. And IIRC the EMMI fights dont count towards it at all, nor do cutscenes.  

Its mainly there for speedrunners I think, not for the average player.

Theres a demo for Metroid? I’m in. 

And yeah every game should have a demo.


Bring back game demo disks!


Yep, that happened to me a while ago. I was super hyped when a souls-like Final Fantasy developed by Team Ninja leaked, which ended up being Stranger of Paradise: FF Origin. Then the trailer released and it was shit. I was 100% dissapointed and was not going to buy the game.

Buuut when the demo released (the second one, I missed the first), I absolutely LOVED it. The graphics are meh but the gameplay is awesome. I played the demo on repeat on the available days and tested every single job, easily surpassing 10 hours of gameplay (IN A DEMO). I'm now fully inclined to buying the game on release. That's why demos are important.


i remember back when i got my 360 it felt like every new game had a demo, then all of a sudden it stopped. i bought plenty a game from demos and block buster rentals. i also saved money on some really bad ones.


I'm glad to see more and more people playing Metroid because of Dread. It's been a series that just hasn't sold as well as it should, but hopefully this reinvigorates the series and we get more stuff for Metroid


It's funny you post this - I actually had the opposite experience. I lucked out and snagged a special edition the other day before the demo released, and now that I've played the demo I just really wasn't into it and am returning it, lol. The only other Metroid games I've played are the Metroid Prime games, and I thought, "surely 2d Metroid can't feel all that different, can it?"

Don't get me wrong - the game is great, it looks gorgeous, plays well, and seems like a lot of fun for people who enjoy Metroid games. I'm really hyped for people who enjoy Metroid. It's just not a game for *me.* Maybe if it ever goes on a decent sale.


Developers can’t even release stable games anymore, demos are a whole other resource of time


I agree, it was a fantastic demo! It was actually a bit longer than I expected,and I did really enjoy the gameplay. 

However the demo also confirmed my original impression that it wasn’t worth $60(Edit: To me at this moment in time), purely in my personal opinion. For some people it is definitely worth $60, and that’s great! 

I do plan on picking it up if it ever drops to $30 range…maybe in a few years, used on GameFly or something!


I always appreciate a demo! I was on the fence about Metroid Dread from what I'd seen of it but playing the demo confirmed that the game just doesn't interest me so I can save like $90.


This won't be a popular opinion, but this is really the only reason why I choose sometimes piracy. I have really limited budget if it's about video games. I can't just spend 60 eur on a game I won't like or won't be that engaging.

So, this is when I download the game, and check it out. If it's any good for me, I buy it instantly. If not then... no harm feelings, I just delete the game, the download and that's it.

Even if I play the pirated copy to the end and the game has no replay value, I still buy the game.

But I don't want to and can't pay top bucks (yeah, 50-60 eur to me is actually a lot of money) for a game I won't like or enjoy.


Are vouchers still a thing? How did you get them?


Wait...there's a demo for Metroid Dread???


Agreed, reminded me I don't really like this type of game and didn't like the GC version.

Saves me buying it and reselling on eBay.


This would’ve been the opposite for me. I would’ve not bought the game if I had tried the demo. Oh well.


I wish they had the demo at launch, as I got the game but not enjoying, don't get me wrong it's a brilliant game but it's just too hard for me and I was getting frustrated and not enjoying it


I bought it at release, but probably wouldn't have if I had played a demo.


 The demo completely turned me off the game, so thanks to Nintendo for not making me waste 60 dollars here. Game's got a very distinct narrative pacing and atmosphere building problem. Everything felt rushed, and I couldn't feel any weight on about how this is a sequel to Fusion in the timeline.

I'm satisfied with Super, thank-you.


I prefer the Steam/Oculus model of being able to return any game as long as you have less than 2 hours of gameplay and have had it for less than 2 weeks.


How are people finishing this game so quickly?  The bosses are awful, I have to do each boss fight 20 times to beat it.  I've been stuck on the same one for a week now because every attack drains at least two energy tanks and I'm dead after four hits, it sucks.  Then, when you think it's over and you're almost dead, they have a second stage.  Also, the controls are not good, controlling a sidescrolling game with analog sticks is a pain in the ass, it's just ok with the joycon analog stick, but forget trying to play it with a pro controller.  I bought a controller that has dpads instead of analog sticks and it's much better, but there are some parts where the analog stick is still required unfortunately, so I have to switch between controllers.  The super precision aiming required for some bosses also sucks.  I hate games that are so hard that you keep dying 30 times and a row and you just get frustrated and give up.

I love Metroid and have followed it since Metroid 2 first came out on the Gameboy, so this was an instant buy for me, no demo needed.  I'm enjoying the game for the most part but there are some things that could have been done differently.  I also agree that having demos available is a good way to get more potential buyers.  I remember getting PlayStation demo discs and later buying or renting the games from the demo because I liked them so much, Tomb Raider is a good example.


It was release late so the community didn't had to deal with a bunch of crybabies derailing every discussion and throwing temper tantrums like that one MORON who supposedly "created" that glorified, late 90's edgy brawler "God of war"


>the controls were nice

Really? I feel like they're just awful. In order to aim and fire a missile you need 3 buttons and a stick at the same time. It felt like playing old game boy game where you have to press couple of buttons to perform a task because there are not enough of them on the console, and considering how complex modern games are 12 button layout we currently have is all you need.

But the thing is - I'm partly sold by the demo, I watched some streams and it felt boring but after playing the demo I actually enjoyed it. On the other hand I enjoyed metroid fusion at the beginning and then just got tired by constant wall licking.


I've always thought that if every developer put out a demo it'd put a stop to like 90%+ of piracy. A lot of people pirate just to try out a game. But once they have the entire thing downloaded, why should bother to go through official channels. Giving an official way to try the game would stop those people. And the people it doesn't stop from pirating, were never gonna buy the game anyways.


What's funny is they waited 3 weeks after the game's release so everyone will buy the game before even releasing the demo. Not sure why we're praising Nintendo for that, it's kinda shady.


People can tell you how fluid metroid dread is, you don't realize until you play it yourself.


That is the biggest reason why I pirate games, I want to see if I'll like the game without having to buy it, find out I don't like it, and go through the trouble of getting a refund, when that is an option, which isn't always the case. 
If I enjoy the game, I usually end up buying it afterwards.


Bit of a tangent but I really wish people would stop comparing cost to time spent to complete. I completely understand that money is short for some people and they want their money's worth out of something but I'd rather pay £50 for a well paced, exciting experience than a game that's been padded for no reason. I've put 10s of hours into some games and have then got bored of them due to the middle padding and never ended up completing them.


I agree. I played it for 10 minutes and uninstall in disgust. Cant believe they RUINED metroid.

Now to be fair I felt the same way during my first 10 minutes of metroid prime and i quit that game only to come back to it a year later and actually truly appreciate how well they did transition the gaming into an FPS. I still despite the FPS genre as a whole though

metroid dread just feels shallow. early on you get your first missile expansion and theres no fan fair.. the music in the game is just vomit. I get what they were going for, an eerie ton to make the encounters feel more tense and scary.... that probably works for a lot of people. I saw the trailer. I know when i see an EMMI i just need to run. which detracts from how ive always taken my time to explore the areas. I am not a fan of the melee counter. While i dont think it shouldnt have been added to the game from what i read in reviews you dont really even need missile expansions for bosses because its 100% about melee countering and quicktime events. which is a mechanic in games ive never been a huge fan of. Thats not metroid to me. now i cant say for certain as all i did was play a bit of the demo but the sound design alone just really put me off. but when you do kill an emmi and make a zone free to explore i dont think the music changes. metroid is known for having amazing music and this game throws that away for a false sense of immersion. I think this immersion aspect would have much more suited a FPS metroid moreso than this as the limited viewing angle and not being able to see behind you would be a much bigger deal. though running from an EMMI in an fps would be annoying as hell.

furthermore the games frame rate drops when it decides to shift into cinematic mode vs the locked side scrolling mode. that just pisses me off. i would literally pay double for nintendo games if i could play them on my PC. its like going into the korok forest in breath of the wild.... did they not test this game? why have so much foliage that the framerate drops to like 5 FPS.... nintendo has always had the weakest hardware. the fact that the dock doesnt add any power to the system then whats the point in it being a home console? 98% of my play time is docked ive only gone hand held when the powers out. as an adult i drive myself places so its not like i can game in the car like i did as a kid with metroid2


I disagree completely on that whole “demos negatively impact sales” thing. Other than that, it really makes me wish we gone back to the days when more demos were released either before or after the releases of such big games instead of say, locking them behind pre orders like we’ve seen with many AAA titles in the last few years or, as we’ve seen too many times with Oculus titles, not releasing one for any of them at all.


Demos have a 1/8 chance of increasing sales from a stance of pure logic. Let's say your game sucks and the demo shows that, you'll get less sales because you released the demo. Let's say your game is okay and the demo sucks, then you'll get less sales. Let's say your game is okay and the demo is okay, then you'll get less sales purely because there's a contingent of players who will play a demo and leave the game behind after that. Let's say your game is great but your demo sucks because your game doesn't have a simple vertical slice or the story doesn't easily slice into a demo, you'll lose sales! Let's say your game is great but your demo is mediocre, you'll lose sales partly from the people who write the game off and the people who play the demo and move on. Then there's the game that's great and the demo shows that, it *might* increase sales but so will trailers, reviews, and word of mouth. Then you have medicore games where the demo is awesome, like Doom having the best maps/stages in the shareware but the rest is adequate, that probably will increase sales but other factors are likely at play. Then there's the last one, your game sucks but the demo is great. That will increase sales for a while and probably would make the demo worth it. But you'd likely be just as well served by using your good demo and building off it.

So you can see that from all those scenarios you have consumer habits that encourage most games to not have a demo.


I was 100% expecting this to be another "wtf nintendo why you no 4k celebrity-VA handjob" post

im pleasantly surprised

Im glad you're enjoying Metroid Dread, OP. get ready for people screeching about how it isnt a 100+ hour, fully cinematic game that could double as a hollywood release


Imbarreslingly the best time I got into a new game was when internet goes out & Im active on xbox.

When you gameshare you only have access to your friends purchases  & while we do play lots of games together we have our own interests too, we had a big internet issue up here with Midcontenent at one point.. anyway he got really into Battlefield campaign & I got into Darksiders. Neither of us would have touched those otherwise.


Fun fact: I've never bought even a single game that has a demo.

I'm not sure why but when I see that a game has a demo it's almost the kiss of death.


Aside from potentially hurting sales, every developer I’ve heard discuss demos and presentations being shown at game shows (eg E3) hates them because they require weeks of dedicated time to make which is taken away from the final product. Time spent making a demo is unique to the demo and doesn’t improve the full game. Given that 99% of developers are under time constraints to push games out to meet publisher & marketing expectations, contracts, angry gamers etc, a demo can end up hurting the quality of the final product.

If they release the demo after the game comes out (ie when they actually have time to make the demo), they then get accused of trying to cheat fans like numerous comments in this thread have already done 😅


wait.....
THERE’S A DEMO?!?!??!


It makes more sense for new IPs. If you need a demo for Metroid…


Demos isn't this huge new thing it has *always* been a gaming thing for the community back in the day, developers(reffering to console, handheld developers not pc cause I know there are plenty of steam games that have demos that we can all try out like bless those who still do it ♡♡) that you see now for those of you who are new to gaming, stopped pushing out demos they used to do it without a problem back in the day to get the correct feedback from the customers, like look at the developer for bravely default to splatoon releasing demos till this day for us to get a feel of the game - I title those two folks real game developers(example here) that care for the customers voices instead of the ones that used to do it back in the day to stop doing it just to be selfish greedy terrible people that now care for whale cash -_-...and want to scam you to get you spend lots of money on trashy games. 


I miss having demos...it was fun to know how the game feels before buying it..sad that new gamers real ones not the clout chasing woke plastic people but real new ones never got to experience what we did back in the day T-T

Edited.


>I was extremely hesitant about spending £50 on a shor

Most games are short

The 'true' lentgh of the game is the fastest possible speedrun of. The goal of a game is to finish it, reach the credits. If you could do that in less than an hour, that is the game's true length. The 10 hours (for me btw it took a little over 7 and the game kicked my ass consistently) comes from things like cutscenes, game overs, getting lost, etc.

My point is that deciding wether or not to buy a game based of how long it takes to beat is dumb due to most games being short (I'm only saying most cause every now and then you'll have something like Persona 5 that's just naturally long as shit). Your only deciding factor when buying a game should be "will I enjoy it?"


Why did you not buy physical so you can sell on when you’re finished? Like you say, it was only a short game.


Wow this game is full priced!?

I thought it was 20 bucks :I


Then you play GOTG demo and don't feel anything on if you want the game or not


[deleted]


I understand why some would not though. I think its about 50-50 that demo gets me to buy the final product. In many cases, the demo stops me from buying the actual game because now I know it's not for me, or not something I would pay full price for (looking at all the Bandai Namco games here).

Demo is not just "take this part out and let people try it out." It's probably the most risky marketing tool in many cases. The amount of work that goes into having one that is not easily exploitable while showcasing its strength well (and hiding its shortcomings) might just not be worth it for some devs.

That being said, Im definitely downloading Dread demo even though I already beat the game cuz this game needs all the hype it needs so that Metroid 6 doesnt take another 19 years.


Im in the same boat as you as far as price/playtime goes. I do love hollow knight, so i’ll check the demo out (didnt know there was any)

Imo every game should have a demo. If a demo negativly impacts sales, then the game isn’t good enough


I just remember beating it yesterday tho I did get stuck in the water section, for like 20 minutes


Demos are always gonna be a double-edged sword and I do firmly believe you can't have a demo for every game. Some games are really complex and deep and kind of demand a real immersive sink into the gameplay or world to have a fair impression of it. Others are really just about what you present for the demo. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite was a great example of a terrible demo conceptually that hurt impressions of the game.

Metroid though is the type of game you could honestly put out a 30 to even 60-minute demo of if you wanted and would likely sell tons of people on it. The general gameplay loop of exploring is so fun, and it's a very honest game in it's presentation where if you like it you're gonna keep liking it, nothing is really going to throw a wrench in to make it less fun, only more as you progress.


I think it just comes down to fairly old studies showing that demos have a clear negative impact on sales. For example, a study in 2013 showed that the average Xbox 360 game sold more than twice as much in the first 6 months if it didn't have a demo released and instead just showed trailers.

You can argue back and forth pros and cons, but a company isn't going to put in the time, effort and money to make a demo if it's statistically shown to make them sell less of the game.


Demos definitely drive sales and I don’t understand why they slowed down on doing them. If I’m unsure about a game and there is no demo anywhere, I pass up the game entirely until I can try it for free, borrow it or sail the high seas to try it.


Vouchers?


I was thinking about picking this up as well the timing is perfect gonna try out the demo for sure


let's go back to the shareware era... everything is a demo until you unlock it. Embrace tradition.


I have similar experience


And also they should release on game launch


Others might be able to chime in but it certainly feels 60FPS except in a few areas.


>Of course demos can negatively impact a games sales but if the developer is confident enough in their game I don't see why they can't release a short demo.

It's not a matter of confidence. You simply cannot convince everyone. No game is 100% liked by everyone. A demo might convince some to buy the full game, but it might also confirm others that the game's not for them.

If your game is big and popular, you're probably better off leaving it to peer pressure. Those undecided will feel more inclined to try the game out to see what the fuss is all about, and if buying the game is the most straight-forward game to test it, then many will just buy it... And then maybe re-sell it if they're not pleased. But you've already made money on that purchase; If you release a demo before launch, that same people will just play the demo and not make any purchase.

If your game is not that well-known, then a demo is probably a better idea. Let people try it out before buying to get an idea of what it feels like, since there's no peer pressure to play it that could convince them otherwise, and people would be less inclined to spend money on something they don't know or that doesn't seem popular among other people.

That's why a demo some time after release is probably a good way to go for big publishers. You've already done the bulk of sales, those that could've caved in to peer pressure have either already bought it, or peer pressure is decreasing fast since the highest push happens at launch. If marketing, hype and novelty hasn't made the yet undecided buy the game, a demo now to try it out first hand might be the only thing that could help convince them.


To put things in perspective, I too but about 80 hours into Hollow Knight across about 2 and a half playthroughs over the course of about a 4-5 weeks or so. Since Dread launched I've played over 70 hours. I've done between 12 and 15 playthroughs, half of which were 100% playthroughs, and I just can't get enough of this game.

But if I'm being honest, I only liked Hollow Knight because it reminded me of Super Metroid


I just started the demo and I think I’ll get myself Metroid or Christmas. Without the demo I might have forgotten about it by then. Clearly an amazing game. Can’t wait for SMTV though.


It might big be so dire to have a demo of Nintendo had a refund policy like stream.


I'm still super hesitant, mostly because of the 10 hours thing. I know lenght does not equal quality, but it's usually harder to get immersed in such a short game for me.


I didn’t even know there was a demo lol straight up went in blind and loved it


My birthday is coming up next month and I intend to ask the game as a gift to my girlfriend. I'm 100% sure I'll end up buying the game as soon as I play the demo, so I won't even download it for now, lol.


No idea there was a demo! Thank you stranger!


The demo has also definitely made me want to buy the game. But I’ll wait for a sale.


it came after i Bought it (Second trailer was enough to sell me the game).

but is good that there is a demo available for those undecided.


the demo was my final push to finally buy the game. I sold my Witcher 3 (don't have the money to buy multiple switch games) and right now I'm going back home with Dread in my backpack


There's only one reason why companies might not release a demo. Because they think a demo will prevent people from wanting to buy the full game. The only reason why that might be the case is if your game sucks. 
 
But it's the integrity of a company to release a demo. It shows that they are willing to come under fire because **they believe in their game**


I tried the demo last night it’s a great game I’ll pick it up eventually. I’m not happy Nintendo though if you are listening. The n64 isn’t the best and even though I’m still going to buy it it’s because I know you’ll have paper Mario on there. But please improve your own IP on your own HARDWARE!! but like always hobbiest and clever people always seem to pump out the superior emulators. Hell I even remember being 12 years old and writing to Nintendo via my Nintendo power monthly subscription about emulators back in early 00. Asking how are emulators even possible and will Nintendo release their own. Crazy


I tried playing Super Metroid on the switch and really enjoy it. I didn’t know there was a demo for dread but I’ll definitely check it out


Statistically demo's lower the amount of sales for a game, but what it does do is create happier consumers who do buy the game after (generally). Demo's is most certainly a pro-consumer move than it is pro-business. I also always have this fear that a demo represents a game poorly, both intentionally or unintentionally because businesses will always do business things.


It's a simple business decision where it apparently makes sense to not release a demo most of the time. 

They released the Metroid demo because it made financial sense - I imagine sales weren't what they originally anticipated prior to the demo


Why would videos not work for what you describe?


I didn't even know there was a demo, and I was holding back as well.  Now I'll try it out.


Some games just don't translate to demos well, though


I got the full game before playing the demo, and I gotta say, the game is awesome. I'm an over-40 gamer and played nearly every single Metroid game that's been made (my claim to fame is that I beat the original Metroid 2 on Gameboy nearly 30 years ago, which was a crazy-confusing game to navigate) and this one is right up there with Super Metroid for me. Someone said this in a later comment, but it is also harder than any of the others that I can remember, even now as a seasoned gamer. I've died numerous times, but never unfairly. Really great game.


Demos disappearing in recent console gens is a trend I will never understand. 

I loved RE2 as a kid but when the remake was set to release I was like "eh, I've played that to death already" but I was at friend's place we decided to boot up the demo and it floored us, I bought the game on launch because of it.


Wow, vouchers.  I forgot for a moment those use to be a thing here.

Glad you are liking the game though.


If demos were shown to consistently improve sales, then they would be released more often.

Demos are 100% a good thing for the consumer. For an adult on a tight budget, it helps that adult decide if the game’s worth the money. For a child with no money, it’s one more free thing they can clutter their home screen with. For someone whose most limited commodity is time, well, they can just ignore demos. For people who are buying the game anyway, an early demo lets them get a taste to tide them over.

But for developers? They’re putting a little bit of time and money into porting a chunk of the game to run without the other chunks, or if they just put gates in on an otherwise full game (if it’s a pre-release demo) then they risk leaking the files of the full game early. And that time/money investment could potentially prevent more sales than it brings in. It’s a gamble on top of an investment.


To be clear, you're unusual. The data shows that often demos have a negative effect on sales.


what's the content of the demo?  first level of the game?


It runs both ways. 

The monster hunter rise demo actually turned me off from buying the game because i was planning on getting it, I loved world but then when I played the Demo for rise I was like. I’ve seen this game before and had this experience so I think I’m fine with not playing it. 

I also didn’t like that I couldn’t find weapon training anywhere and had forgotten all the stuff I learned from world. 

I have no doubt Rise is a great entry. I’m just really bad at playing sequels unless the sequel is very heavily narrative driven. If it isn’t. It feels all the same for me.


I wish devs released secret demos hidden in games like they used to. But in the age of digital downloads I can see that being more of an issue if someone doesn’t want the demo.


I mean with the way Steam handles refunds basically every game on there has a demo now (even if it's officially not supposed to be used that way). I'm for it.


What was interesting in THIS CASE is the demo came out a week AFTER the games release.

Not before, like every other game.... perhaps it wasn't selling as well in the second week and it was the final marketing tool?


I got the game for £35 at Curry’s just so you know.


>feels 60fps but no idea

It's 60fps, until late-game when you can get stuff with crazy particle effects and large numbers of things on screen.


I'm mixed on demos.  They're a hard thing to get right.

I think Nintendo's unique approach here -- launch the game, wait until sales start cooling off, and **then** put out a demo for it -- is probably the best one for most games.  For early sales, I think demos don't have much potential to hook people who wouldn't buy it otherwise but *do* have the potential to turn people off.  But after the early buyers, I think the demo *can* have the potential to get a few more players in.


\+1

but from a dev point of view i can understand why they don't want to. they're most of the time under heavy pressure (crunch) just to get a proper working version out of the door come release day.

sadly the big corps (ea, activision, ..) take the cheap route and instead of a demo offer "closed beta" access codes when you pre-order. which offers player a glimpse of the game, while at the same time not taking up many additional resources an actual demo would need.


I bought Hollow Knight because of the Dread Demo haha


Agreed. Sold me the game. I was planning to buy it to play it on my vacation time.


I was on the fence about the game until the demo, but after I played through it 5 times in a row I’m having a hard time waiting till Christmas lol


I was in doubt but the demo was so good ! Cant wait for the full game


They used too. Idk why they stopped.


Thing is statistically demos cause people to buy games less. Never looked into why. 

Also creating a demo space can be a bit troublesome and take away from the game's development. There's definitely some.games it works for but not every game should have a demo


Even for high quality games, for every 1 person convinced to buy it there are numerous who change their mind as a result of playing the demo.


Yes demo's is a sign of confidence in a game. I have had the pleasure to play most of the Metroid games and it's a fantastic series. I'm glad there is a demo to let new people play the game and get a feel of this awesome series.


Oh for sure! I grew up in the nineties with Super Metroid and although I love the new games, there's just something about a platform Metroid game that makes me feel home.


>There all I really have to say to be honest but I'm pretty sure of that demo didn't release I probably would never have bought Metroid ~~unless it dropped to half price~~.

May as well get rid of that, pretty much redundant with Nintendo...


Didn’t know there was a demo for this and going to download it right now


Big companies like Nintendo should always release demos.


That demo got me hooked!


On the other hand, I was really excited for Voice of Cards. But my interested evaporated entirely upon actually playing the demo.


Time played is enough, but forget worrying about that, it's enjoyment from start to Finish. I don't agree with most high scoring Nintendo games but this one really is great .


Yeah, I wish they released the demo when the game launched because I would not have bought the game. It just doesn't feel like metroid. Way too linear and not enough exploration.


It certainly is 60fps. Very stable as well


Convinced me not to spend $90 CAD on the full game. I’m just struggling finding my way through the section with the EMMI. Just keep repetitively getting caught when I just want to explore, and I’m just end up feeling I’m not that good at this type of game. Loved Ori. As polished as this is Metroid is, the one and done death trying to escape isn’t getting much sense of satisfaction for me.


hold up there's a demo  


what


You hit the nail on the head. Had a long trip to my sister's baby shower today and decided to download the demo last night to play in the car today. Holy heck I would have been missing out had they not released this demo. This game is actually SO GOOD


I also tried the demo and I loved it, and to be honest I’m very inclined on buying the game however do you guys know if I buy the game will I start where I left the demo or do I need to start all over again?
Thanks ! Game is awesome btw


Since Nintendo notoriously refuses refunds— even seconds after purchase, demos should be mandatory. Just the first 20-30 mins of a game is enough to give most people a good feeling of the game and if they want to purchase it.

With the overwhelming, staggering amount of crapware and shovelware on the Switch coupled with **zero customer rating system** (💩💩💩), a demo should be standard practice.

P.S. I have purchased **EVERY SINGLE GAME** that I played a demo of. Example: I wasn’t planning on buying Metroid Prime but after playing the demo, I ordered a physical copy and had it delivered next day! 🥳🥳🥳

All of those games I was on the fence about or had no initial thoughts of buying it until I played the demo, so, I have to disagree that “demos are a double-edged sword”. No, if you have a decent game, the overwhelming majority of people who play the demo, buy it— unless you are peddling straight up garbage crapware/shovelware so obviously you don’t want people finding out before they buy it. But “tricking” people into buying a shit game only galvanizes those folks to hit up social media and call your shit game out or post YouTube reviews rightfully crapping all over it and refusing to buy anything from that dev again. Crapware/Shovelware devs shoot themselves in their own d!cks.


The short length is a valid reason to be hesitant to buy the game IMO. I say this as someone that considers Dread the game of the year. If you're not exactly in a position to spend a whole lot of money frequently then it makes sense to hope for more hours from a game.

That said, Dread respects your time super well and the experience is really condensed and carefully paced. A game twice its length would give you less interesting content.

Hollow Knight is a fair comparison but, man, it just happens to be the best software deal in gaming since the Orange Box. Hollow Knight is just ridiculous.


I just played some of the demo and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Now granted, I haven't played a Metroid since Super Metroid on SNES so I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience of this game. It did feel good to play through again, I may hook it up to my display and dust off my Pro controller and give it a go.


I just buy the cheapest physical copy i can....that way if i dont connect with the game i just resell very quickly and it only cost me a couple of quid...and I am not liking Metroid Dread at all!


Demos are where it's at! I always looked forward to every new issue of Xbox magazine back in the day for demos alone lol


So if you end up purchasing the game after playing the demo, do you have to start over? Or does your progress transfer over to the game?


The demo really sold me, I was on the fence on whether I want to blow $60 on a game I’ll play through once most likely. The game ran so smooth and I really enjoyed the gameplay and the music. Had this demo not existed, I probably would’ve held back.


metroid is a great franchise, no matter which one you decide to play youll have quite a challenging experience, especially if its your first time, or if its been years since you played a particular title. the came can be incredibly easy once you beat it knowing how to get past certain bosses or "dead ends" metroid zero mission for the game boy advance is the only one i got to playthrough countless times. quickest ive beaten that game was a few minutes shy of two hours....that being said, i couldnt tell you how many times i played that game to accomplish such a quick win. until i play dread, i will say that the best title in the franchise is super metroid. i still have a challenge playing that one


100%💯💯💯

I was not going to buy the game until I played the demo and craved more of it. Developers and companies should release a part of their game so people can try it before spending 60-70. I loved receiving the demo games in the old playstation and xbox magazines. They need to bring em back.


thats awesome! I had a similar experience. Dread coming out is what got me to finally play the metroid series (which had been on my list for a while but i had never gotten into them). But I also think Dread is a special case when it comes to demos. It absolutely needed one because metroid was completely under the radar, and only those who were already metroid fans were really excited for it. Nintendo did absolutely nothing to give people easy access to the older games to give newcomers a feel for the series, so dread was essentially just dropped on us. The demo was probably a more useful tool for a game like this then for a new Halo, Fallout, GTA, etc. because those games are widely-known and don't really need that piece of advertising, thus developers are more concerned with their selling points and might not want to release demos.


Gamedev here. Whether or not a game releases a demo highly depends on the publisher and platform, and not as much on the developer. Also some games just work way better as a demo than others.


Yes I feel the same! I was always interested in it because its in space and has a female protagonist (those are hard to come by in video games) so I played the demo and Im getting the game and the amiibo for christmas. Just finished the demo a second time


Spend money to make a demo so people can say “this game sucks” and not get their money? As a dev id rather i get all ur money


I speedran the demo and got 36 min. Not the best time for most but it still is my personal record. I died at lest 4 times and it's 4gb of recording.


Yeah took me 20 hours to 100% (which came to 12 hours on the in-game clock). And I’m well versed in Metroid, though I do like to take my time.


That makes perfect sense.  I know I've spent far more time than 15 hours in the game. Most of the difference must be either dying and repeating an EMMI section or boss, or studying the map.


Thanks for this information, I was wondering what the hell was going on with the game clock when I would spend two hours playing and it would say I played less than an hour. I knew that it wasn't just a question of dying. I finished the game 100% and my clock say 13 hours of play time but I actually played near 23 hours. A very solid game, well deserving of its price tag.


I did several play throughs with a lot of idling. My Nintendo play time says about 70 hours while my actual runs through the game were like 16 hours for the 100% and like 8 hours for a couple speed runs on Normal and 3.5 hours for a speed run on hard.  So that’s like 27 hours what the game counted as me actually playing and nearly 43 hours of map checking, deaths and leaving the system on while doing something else. That still seems pretty high. I was switching between consoles and I wouldn’t be surprised if something glitched and it accidentally doubled my time or something.


Yeah my 100% first run said 13 hours and I knew I played much longer than that. Switch says over 20 hours. An absolute blast the whole time.


> My current playtime is clocked at around 8 hours according to the game

I had the same experience. I loaded up my game and it said I was about at eight hours, and I had spent *at least* twelve hours, maybe more like sixteen.


Is under 20 hours for a full price game go good now?  I could never justify that when hollow knight, valheim, Stardew, etc have given me over a hundred hours each for 20 bucks or less.


So basically, it pauses when youre not playing the game? Sounds accurate to me.

In my first playthrough, which took me about 7 hours to finish (IRL time), I only looked at the map twice. Some boss fights I died a lot, others, like a certain returning boss, I didnt die at all because it was actually a proper Metroid boss.

Dread is just a short game for people who play a lot of Metroid.

EDIT: Nintendo fanboys suck. Say anything about a Nintendo product that isnt 100% positive and youre wrong. Lol. What a joke. Dread is not the best Metroid game. Get over it.


You do not, they are, first 10%


About 10% of the game.


If it goes up to the first real EMMI it’s basically the tutorial, less then 10%. 

For reference I rarely replay games, and the only game i did speed runs in was Tropical Freeze. I have 70hrs in Dread from replays trying to get better times because it’s just fun.


In every demo I’ve played on the Switch, I’ve been able to transfer my save to the full game. But I don’t know about Metroid Dread specifically.


Demos best describe what they're selling.  They let you find out for yourself whether you're likely to enjoy the whole game.  It's a gutsy move by the devs, because it can backfire.  I think in this case, they were pretty confident it would lead to more sales.


I bought monster hunter stories 2 because of the demo. It was really engaging and being able to see and feel how the game played sold me on it. I will probably get dragon quest eventually because of the demo. 

I really want to get SMT V when it comes out but a small part of me is worried I won’t enjoy it. I really would love a demo and it would probably seal the deal handidly for me.


Not having a demo in today's day and age is probably worse for sales, especially with new IPs.

I'm interested in playing Returnal. I'm not sure if I'd like it though. There's no demo, and Playstation Store doesn't let you return games. Therefore, I'm just not buying the game. Now I only buy games if they're on sale, or it's an IP I already know/love (Ratchet & Clank, Mario, etc.) I no longer take risks with new IPs. 

Digital games should either have a demo/trial or the stores should have a return policy similar to Steam. Otherwise, with game prices increasing (PS5 games are now $90CAD) people are going to be less likely to take a risk on a new IP.


This is exactly what happened to me with that Square Enix card RPG. Demo completely turned me off.


Yeah, from a business standpoint, demos risk driving away sales in equal or greater numbers to sales they generate. It’s hard to convince companies to spend money creating something that has little chance of returning that investment and a chance of actually losing them money when those resources could be put towards something more productive from the company’s perspective.

In general, I think demos are most useful for high quality but under-hyped games, usually from indie studios. For a really good game, the biggest hurdle is getting people to take a chance so word of mouth can spread and a demo is helpful there.

For anything that doesn’t check both of those boxes, demos are a mixed bag at best. I think in Dread’s case, this might have been a good way to go. The game plays *very* well, so that weighs in favor of giving people who are hesitant a taste of it, and there have been enough concerns voiced about other aspects like playtime or being 2D that there are still interested but hesitant players.

Meanwhile they waited until far enough after release that the demo doesn’t risk undercutting the initial hype, but still comes out soon enough to entice people for holiday.


That's why it makes sense to put out a demo AFTER the initial wave of sales (like they did here).

You get all the sales from people who are interested, and some of the sales from people who were on the fence and decided to give it a shot.  Then after a couple weeks or a month, you put the demo out, and you get more people who buy it that would have otherwise not at all.  Even better if you coordinate the demo release with the first minor sale (say 20% off).

You're basically creating another big sales spike, but you already got the people who were curious in the first month, so the demo hasn't risked losing those people's money, instead only giving you a secondary sales spike without needing the typical big half-off sale to create that sales spike.

A late demo is a win-win, IMO.


Yeah. I think that's why something we've been seeing recently is the demo getting released some time after the game comes out instead of before it. At that point, the people who were going to buy it but would've lost interest after a demo would've already bought it.


Technically speaking it's very rarely business friendly.  


Good Game, Good Demo? Good.  
Good Game, Okay Demo? Bad.  
Good Game, Bad Demo? Very Bad.  


Okay Game, Good Demo? Good.  
Okay Game, Okay Demo? Okay.  
Okay Game, Bad Demo? Bad.  


Bad Game, Good Demo? Good.  
Bad Game, Okay Demo? Good.  
Bad Game, Bad Demo? Bad.  


As you can see, the better a game is the more potentially harmful a demo is, demos theoretically benefit bad games more than good, although it's more complex than this massive oversimplificaiton.


That’s the opposite of a problem.

I loved Dread and want it to do well, but I want it to be bought by people who know they will enjoy it, not by people who got swept up in the hype because they felt like they had to only to find that they spent $60 on something they don’t enjoy and getting soured on the franchise.

More people paying for games they enjoy and less people paying for games they don’t enjoy is a good thing for everybody.


Or sometimes the demos are just too **good**. I was playing the Puyo Puyo Tetris demo and was like "omg this is all the content I need, there's very little reason to buy the full game." I'm not complaining but that demo may have been a little too generous for their own good.


Demo needs to be a thing with digital media. With physical you can always sell it back and get at least some of your money back.


Yeah. I feel like companies 100% know this and that’s why some of them choose not to release demos for certain games.


Selling a customer something they’re immediately unhappy with is not “business-friendly.” It’s short-sighted and counterproductive.


The world needs to become more consumer friendly this is why cyberpunk was released on ps4, this is why companies have micro transactions out the ass. Because its business friendly.


This is what happened with me. Tried the Metroid Dread demo and from what I played it was fun but I'm not willing to put up with the frustration of having to revisit multiple rooms multiple times to try to find some secret to progress to the next area. On top of that (and this isn't the game's fault), in a game requiring such precision input it's very annoying to be fighting against the game design (not in a perjorative way but it is a game designed to be difficult) and joy on drift simultaneously. Drift issues have greatly impacted how much time I spend on my switch.

I also understand that this is fundamentally what makes a Metroidvania but this one is not for me.

edit: autocorrect


>Sometimes a person trying the game out causes them to not buy it, resulting in a loss in sales whereas they may have stuck with it if they already spent their money.

I fall into this category. I was thinking of buying the game, never played a Metroid game but it's so highly regarded I was going to give it a shot. Played the demo - it's a super well-made game and the controls are tight but eh, it's just not for me.

With that said, there are probably more games I've bought after playing demos than haven't bought. Back in the PS2 days, the majority of games I bought were based on the demo discs I'd get in Playstation Magazine that I otherwise would have never even looked at.


Not to mention that a demo should take atleast some effort. I know some devs just use an "older version" of their game but that isn't really representation of the actual game or could still have bugs in it that may allow people to basically play the full game in a demo.


But that being said, a game always should have a demo. You can watch gameplay of games but you never truly get the same feeling as playing the game yourself.


This would have been me.  I'm a huge Metroid fan, but I'm finding Dread to be super frustrating, and I've all but given up on it.  I think if I'd played the demo I probably would have passed on the game.


Why should I care what the fuck Nintendo gets on a sale?


Ehhhh, if the devs are confident a game is good and it truly is, I think it’s mostly beneficial. Problem is most games aren’t released market-ready these days. But you still make a good point


But should players be baited and trapped? If people are just sticking to it because they feel they have to after spending their money, well that’s all kinds of wrong. A game should be fun and compelling, not some forced exercise based on a perception of lost funds.

If a demo doesn’t make you want to buy it then the demo has done its job. Not every game is for everyone. It’s better to be honest upfront for both the consumer and the businesses image.


Yep. I wouldn't have a bought it. I played for 30 minutes.  Hated it. Oh well.


But in that same vein, if only the people that bought the full game can post reviews, then only people that loved the demo and bought/loved the full game will leave reviews.

That's an easy way to get things to 4-5 Stars if the eshop ever had such a system.


Not releasing one could also be a double-edged sword too, though. Many times, people wait for reviews to come out and end up not buying the game at all because a reviewer didn't like it, even though they might have actually not agreed with the reviewer if they played it themselves.

Both releasing one and not releasing one have their own problems and the value of a demo is going to vary from game to game and depend a lot on the quality of said demo.


From a business perspective it’s arguably better that people who won’t enjoy/like your product don’t buy it, because it ensures that your existing customer base as a whole is happier and more receptive to future marketing efforts. This is especially true if you’re a company like Nintendo who release a wide range of products for different tastes - they’d rather people feel that they didn’t waste their money on Metroid Dread if it makes them more likely to consider buying other games in the future.


If you're confident that your game is great, it shouldn't be a problem.


This is true. There are three outcomes to demos:

1. Customer likes what they tried out a lot, and buys.

2. Customer likes what they tried out, but not enough for a purchase

3. Customer does not like what they tried out, and doesn’t purchase.

It’s a higher change of no purchase, for working on a demo. That’s why it’s not worth a demo to larger developers/publishers.


Everything Nintendo has done with Dread leading up to release shows their confidence in the game. They know it's good and they want everyone else to know, too.


I wish I had a library like that in my city. Unfortunately I live in a country where Nintendo has no presence.


Dread probably cost a fraction of what  Metroid Prime 4 is costing. They have to build up hype for the heavy hitter and as a Metroid fan, all the better.

Bring that Prime 1 remaster as well, Nintendo!


What is SEO?


I’d be interested in the numbers on this based on the timing of the demos. With a delayed demo like this, you still sell to that initial wave, but have potential to bring in more people who were reluctant to buy day 1. With a demo before release, you risk people playing and deciding not to purchase.


Speaking from personal experience, most of the demos I’ve played resulted in me NOT buying the game. However, I wouldn’t have bought those games regardless so demos have actually caused me to buy more games than I normally would.


That was the general consensus wasnt it, that was years ago though right?


Because most games are bad.


If anything it might hurt sales

1) People who already want to play it will buy it

2) people on the fence might eventually buy it out of FOMO or an impulse purchase after thinking about it for a while

3) people on the fence may play a demo and realize they don’t want it

Like, a demo rarely sells a game (especially one as formulaic as a Metroid metroidvania) but may turn people away


I think a nod should be given to the dragon quest xi demo, which was published and distributed by nintendo. I played that demo for 15 hours before it ended and was a huge chunk of the game, it was crazy.


To be fair, Nintendo has been fairly good with demos in the Switch era. A lot of their games have it.


Cadence of Hyrule demo is great, and so is Ori.


That’s what happened to me with Dread. Played the demo, finished it, felt good for finishing it successfully and then I was like “that was awesome! Let’s never play that again”


That’s a good thing for the consumer, surely. Failing to see the issue. Means they have to make better games.

Edit: I didn't realise this place was so anti-consumer. Makes a lot of sense now.


[deleted]


Was a bit short lived for me tbh. Bit I guess I can't complain since it's a demo.


I spent a good 40 minutes fighting the 3rd EMMI. Might not sound like a lot, but considering each encounter was around 12 seconds - it was pretty enraging.


Metroid Dread’s map is most certainly not bigger than Hollow Knight’s. But it’s big enough where even though you move fast it doesn’t feel small


Iirc mirrors edge was maybe 8 hours, and can be beaten much faster once you get the hang of it


Any Halo game. Campaign is 8-13 missions. Most commonly 10 missions. Can be beaten in like 5 hours at a decent pace. 

I get that Halo has multiplayer. And for some that's the whole reason to buy a Halo game. But for those of us who like Halo campaigns more than the multiplayer. It's 60 bucks for a handful of hours.


The comparisons to Hollow Knight annoy me. HK is *too long.* Tightening it up to reduce play time and increase the pacing would result in a better game.

People seem to forget that shorter action and platforming games are more *replayable*. Most Metroidvanias since SotN are built for multiple playthroughs, either through alternate modes or challenges to finish a run under certain criteria.

As someone who likes RPGs I've actually found that long games make it hard to control my backlog even when I go on spells of not buying a new single player game for 3 months.


Saying Hollow Knight has less production value than Metroid Dread, is basically the same argument as 3D AAA over 2D (Dread). It’s hard to compare 2D illustrated style against 3D render, but for the style Hollow Knight is going for, it’s production value is top notch. So is Dread, for the artistic style they are going for.

Just to be clear, I don’t disagree with you on length, 3D AAA vs 2D game value etc. just saying IMO Hollow Knight doesn’t have any less production value than Metroid Dread, gameplay aside both are top tier production value.


Do people not complain? Everywhere I see a AAA title with that length, complaints follow.

Some people say they'll wait for a sale, others are fans and don't mind the length, others want to know if there's endgame content or replayability, others are more interested in quality etc. And I've seen all that reflected with Metroid Dread, maybe just more so (outside of Metroidvania circles) because it's a more niche franchise from a publisher who famously doesn't decrease the price on their games much.

Maybe that's more of an indication of where I hang out though. You may be fully correct and I just don't see it.


For that matter there are so many 3D  AAA games that last 30-80 hours. Game length is understandably a factor for minors and people with limited disposable income, but a lot of people I discuss games with already have a significant backlog. Like do you really need your next purchase to be 60 hours when you haven't even touched The Witcher 3 expansions and just bought a full collection of remastered games on sale for less than $20?


The main argument is that nintendo dropped metroid for so long, allowing indie Devs to revolutionize the genre, making it the standard to release tons of content for a reasonable price. 2D Metroidvanias are almost seen as indie-only games right now because the last new 2D metroid was 20 years ago and only indie devs have been making similar games since.

I really liked dread, but when compared to games like hollow knight or Ori, the amount of content pales in comparison while the price is multiple times higher. And these are fair comparisons to make because most people consider HK and Ori to be some of the best in the genre, a quality Nintendo may have met with dread, but certainly didn't surpass. So all things equal, people are not thrilled that this game has less content for a higher price. And that's a valid and fair criticism, especially when Nintendo basically created their own competition by lying 2d metroid to rest for 2 decades


Yeah, those were good times to be a gamer. I really wish shareware games were still a thing.


They get both better and worse in terms of being annoying, but they're not in as much of the game as you might think.


I had a ton of demo discs from Pizza Hut when I was a kid. The warehouse level in THPS got a lot of play time


Speedruns are down below 1:15 for any% and 2:10 for 100% so far.


I've only done what feels like one main boss so far, a monster that turns invisible and I feel like Hollow Knight is harder. This game doesn't feel too difficult though I can't speak for the rest of the game. I died several times against that boss but each time I got further, learnt more, realised I can also use the environment and the time I killed the boss I did it fairly easily. 

If you're worried maybe try to get the game cheaper or watch some gameplay to try to see if it looks okay. I guess if you don't mind dying and learning then you should be good.


They added it earlier this week.  It wasn't there at launch.


My biggest turn off of a game is that the Demo is often unstable. The final game could be patched up and well updated but I’d never really know if my first impression is test copy that hasn’t been touched since it’s original launch.


Good luck on waiting for it to drop that low.

Nintendo Switch first party games rarely drop that low.


Out of curiosity- why isnt worth $60? It's presentation, feel and gameplay are consistent with a AAA title and 10 hours is standard game length.

I'm genuinely curious, not picking on you or anything.


Obviously not as large a library, but that was my favorite thing about gamepass for PC. I had it for 3 months and it was awesome to be able to jump into a game and not care if I "got my money's worth." Tried so many games and when I got tired of them I didn't feel pressured to keep going. Been thinking about grabbing it again, but "the backlog" is hanging over me :P.


Don't try to justify piracy.  The argument that you'll buy games you're playing for free if you like them is going to ring hollow.  Most people won't believe it, and so they'll think of you as a liar in addition to a pirate.


Yea, feel the same way, I like to eat my food and if I finish it I’ll pay for it but if I only ate some of it then no, I just can’t afford eating out. 

I like to get a massage, but if the message isn’t any good I just leave and don’t pay, I cant afford massages.


They got rid of vouchers in North America but not other regions. In North America, you can often find better sales than the voucher offers, anyway, which is probably why they did away with them.


Here in the UK and the rest of EU I believe we still get vouchers. No idea why to be honest but I can't complain. Nintendo doesn't make sense sometimes.


Yes, it was released earlier today.


Well the end time recorded doesn't count the extra time you used if you died to a boss a bunch of times and then quit until staying until you beat it.  So for example, I tried the final boss like 25 times, but the playthrough where I beat it, it took only 3 tries, so those other 20 plus tries don't count towards my play time.

And on the topic of bosses, you really need to learn the mechanics of each phase.  Also, it doesn't hurt to look at a guide if you're having trouble.  To be honest, while I found many bosses to be hard, once you get the hang of the fights, you really shouldn't be getting hit at all.

For most boss fights, once I got the hang of them, I was able to finish most boss fights near full health.  Your extra health in this game doesn't really do anything, because as you noted, enemies hit to hard.  It's all about avoiding attacks.


The game uses every button, and the layout makes perfect sense, it may just take a bit to get used to as few other 2d platfomers are as mechanically complex. 

No one thinks twice when an fps has you hold one button to steady your aim, press another to firs, move your hand off your second stick to reload, hold a button to bring up a weapon wheel and select with another, ect… There just arnt other games with similar schemes to Metroid as 2d games tend to be simpler mechanically.


As someone else mentioned, demo's have been shown to negatively impact game sales regardless of the game's quality. So the fact that a demo was released at all is impressive.


>I really wish people would stop comparing cost to time spent to complete

Why? It's not an invalid thing to consider when deciding whether or not a purchase is worth it. You might get bored of long games, but other people probably bought those games and loved every one of the 50 hours. Saying that you "wish people would stop" is just patronizing.


Imbarreslingly?


Why would the true length of a game be the time it takes for an expert to play the game instead of the average


>The 'true' lentgh of the game is the fastest possible speedrun of. 

Heavily disagree. Usually, a game isn't particularly made for the speedrunner, and you need to practice a lot to go anywhere near WR territory. Anyone trying to go for the fastest way to beat the game will, ironically, have spent more time in the game than a casual player playing the game how they want. You can't grab a statistic taken from the best players, who have practiced sometimes for years and know a game like the palm of their hand and say "yeah, this is the true length of the game".

Casual players play one way. Speedrunners play a different way. Completionists play another way. You can't say there's a "true" length of a game because everyone approaches games differently. At the very least, there are 3 lengths a game can have: the speedrun, the usual playthrough (the one most people will play) and the 100% route.

>My point is that deciding wether or not to buy a game based of how long it takes to beat is dumb due to most games being short

I disagree again. The length of a game can be an important factor when choosing a game to buy. If the game is short and you want to play it casually once, then there's not much content for you here. Why wouldn't you buy a different game that suits your gameplay style better? A game can be amazing for speedrunners, but not worth much for people who can't or won't put the time and effort to master it, and a  game can be fun to play casually but not to speedrun it.


"super mario world is a 40 second game, actually"


Just my personal anecdote, but I just got the OLED and after that didn't have too much to spend. I chose BOTW as my first game in part because I figured it would last me the longest because I doubt I'll have much extra money for gaming any time soon.


> I imagine sales weren't what they originally anticipated prior to the demo

[Metroid Dread Is The Fastest-Selling Game In Series History In The UK](https://screenrant.com/metroid-dread-game-sales-series-uk/)  

What, pray tell, WERE their sales projections?


I had to borrow the Metroid II game pak back when it came out from a friend.  The stereo main theme in those cancerous earbuds blew my mind at the time.  The music for Metroid II was one of many reasons why I bought a Handy Boy...


Since demos actually need to be developed as a demo I would imagine it was planned for a while just for Halloween.


With the EMMI the solution is simply to rush through that section and find the right exit. If you die just try to remember which direction you went and eventually you'll get the ability to kill the EMMI of that section and then you can explore. 

Also if the EMMI grabs you there are usually two times when you can deflect their grab and kill move but it's a very small window indicated when theres an orange flash.

I hate EMMI too but rushing through its area and getting the ability to kill them made it more enjoyable. In the full game as well you get a cloak and other abilities to help you hide from EMMI.


Start over.


Quick question: without achievements on switch how do you know you’ve 100% the game? Honest question


The EMMI sections are the only part of the game I really don't care for, have those been a part of past metroid games?  I beat OG Metroid back in the mid 80s but haven't played any of the follow-ups until now.


Rule of thumb? No, not to me. I play a lot of cheaper indie games, and most of the AAA games I play are in the 50-80 hour area.

However, there are *degrees* of enjoyment. A truly brilliant, exhilarating game can make up for a short length. And Metroid Dread does that for me comfortably. If you only look at expected hours in a vacuum then you aren’t really assessing the game’s value very thoroughly.

Plus, it has replay value.


What a miserable experience gaming would be if *every* game were 50, 60, 100+ hours long. I would never want to finish anything. Metroid Dread gives you an infinitely better 12-20 hours for $60 than Far Cry 6's or Assassin's Creed Valhalla's 100 hours of mundane busywork that's there simply for the sake of padding out that playtime.


Value is subjective, of course, and I've also played games like hollow knight which give superb value for money in terms of playtime. However, I feel Metroid Dread is well worth $60, in spite of the short playtime, because the game is so polished and refined, it feels like a totally enjoyable experience every moment. Samus moves so well. And I say this as a new Metroid fan, this was my first metroid game. 

Not just that, the game encourages you to replay it. I've played it three times already (first run was just 34% completion in about 11.5 hours, next run was 100%, after that I did a sub 4 hour run). You get different ending screenshots based on your time and the difficulty level. I still haven't tried hard mode but plan to do it at some point. 

Ultimately, it's your decision how to spend your money (I personally never buy games out of sale because they are expensive for me, Dread was the only exception, I might do the same for BOTW2), but I can say you'll really enjoy it if you get it. And now there's a demo for you to try as well!


Length isn't the only way to value a game, though.


I probably wouldn't have bought Metroid, it was gifted, but as one my my favorite series, I have played each main release at least three times -10 hrs first play, 7 hours second, 4 hours third.  Dread is on par with my other favorites in the series.

I played super Metroid the most.  First was probably 15 hours.  Now I beat it once a year in about 2-3 hours.


I prefer a shorter amazing game compared to a lengthy game filled with repetitive and boring content. Metroid Dread is great value.


I have played Rocket League for 1200 hours and that is $0. Doesnt mean all games have to match that, even Hollow Knight would be a really expensive game and a bad deal compared to that.


> now

sub 20 hour games were a norm for a long time, and still are very very prevalent. Basically every resident evil game ever made is under 20 hours for example


Yes a 20hr game is more valuable to ME than a 50hour+ game.


Metroid Dreads 15 hours I played are far better than any 15 hours from Far Cry 6s 60+ hour “gameplay”.


Well it depends if you define playing the game as studying the map screen for where to go, and if you define the time spent retrying after death as playing the game, then I would argue its not super accurate for how long most people will be playing for.


Well, that's not very accurate. Checking the map to find out where you go is playing the game. Dying over and over while fighting a boss is most certainly playing the game. Some bosses took me over an hour to beat, and there are many bosses. That's a lot of inaccurate timekeeping!


Clocks on most platforms include everything from boot time to loading and pause screens.

But I think the real question here is how did you only need to look at the map twice?


>Dread is just a short game for people who play a lot of Metroid.

its the longest 2d metroid game


What does it go up to? >!Kraid?!<


It actually goes up to second EMMI encounter, until you kill it and get the power up.


The Metroid Dread demo doesn't let you save at all


Imo you don't really need the transfer anyway. 

Once you know where you're going replaying the demo section of the game will take most players 20ish minutes.


Yeah I’m enjoying the Stories 2 demo a lot more than I ever expected I would. That said, I hated the Rise demo but I’ve been told it’s not necessarily a great demo for new players and I’m glad I bought it anyway.


I didn't get the newest Monster Hunter after realizing that MH games are just not for me during the demo.  I am so glad too because I was ready to drop 60 dollars on the hype.


Voice Of Cards: Isle of Dragon Roars?


And just to keep the theme going, I am now HOOKED on getting that card game as soon as it goes on sale. Without the demo, I would not be a prospective customer.


Double-edged sword is the only description.


Same with Triangle Strategy.  I was all-in after Octopath, love strategic combat, it was a no-brainer.   Then I played the demo and oh my gosh it was so boring.  Maybe because they dropped you in mid-story and there was sooooo much text about stuff I didn't care about, but yeah it really put me off.


It's probably better for you to download the demo and not like it and not buy the game than it is for you to buy the game, hate it, and then trash it online for how terrible and what a ripoff you thought it was. 

As it is, you're just like, I tried the demo and it just wasn't for me.


Capcom keep doing that for me with their *Monster Hunter* demos. They always feel so absolutely awful, and I'm not spending full money just because people are telling me to "give the game a chance."


I was blown away by the demo. It was incredibly immersive and fun. Like playing a perfectly planned game of D&D.

It’s full of details too! Like how the edges of the world are close to the end of the table, so you nature and grass in the background. Or when you use an item the card always has a matching animation.


Definitely did for me XD everything felt very generic and repetitive. This was all within 10 minutes.


Aren't you glad the demo saved you that money?  Good demos are the most honest way to describe a game to potential buyers.  If the devs are confident that they're putting out a good product, they should be happy to let you sample it before you buy it.  In this case, I'm guessing Nintendo figures it will create even more sales, after people who weren't going to buy or were on the fence get wowed by the demo.


> 
> 
> 
> 
> In general, I think demos are most useful for high quality but under-hyped games, usually from indie studios. For a really good game, the biggest hurdle is getting people to take a chance so word of mouth can spread and a demo is helpful there.

Also I think some games are just much more "demo friendly" than others.

For example I can't imagine a possibly good demo for either Xenoblade game.


> although it's more complex than this massive oversimplificaiton.

I do think the complexities heavily affect your conclusion, though. You've got to weigh how *likely* it is to get a bad demo from a good game. Chances are if you've got a great game on your hands and you just let people play it a bit, they'll like it. It's *unlikely* you'd end up with a bad demo from a great game, unless you go out of your way to pick the bad parts or present them in a bad way... which happens, but not a lot.

In fact I'd say it's easier to get a good demo from any game, since you can curate the best parts to present to people. This might lead to the conclusion that most demos are probably a *good* idea, since you can pick a curated experience for people who are unsure. Even if the game is bad you can just show people the best parts in the demo.


Money > gamer happiness


You’re not thinking like a corporation.


[deleted]


Of course, I'm not denying that. But you can see why most companies opt not to have demos at all.


Especially on stores that don't have any sort of return policy. I have a PS5, I want to try Returnal but I'm not sure I'd actually like it. 

With PS5 games now being $90CAD, there's no chance in hell I'm going to risk buying it without trying it, especially knowing if I don't like it I can't return it.


Which is why refunds are a thing. Of course, Nintendo doesn't get that because they are living in the past.


You made a great point


You need a good balance. Being overly consumer-friendly doesn't help if you allow fans to change your design philosophy away from what you're looking to make. It's a case-by-case basis.


MTX’s also benefit consumers when done correctly as it incentivizes devs to keep up support for games with new content to keep people playing them. Nintendo just straight up abandons most of their games compared to how much content Xbox, PC, and PS games get that sometimes keep the content flowing for years.


Predatory MTXs and stuff are bad of course


You shouldn't, but you are not the one who decides whether they make a demo or not.


Because if Nintendo doesn't make money on games, then they stop making games. If you love Metroid as a franchise, you should absolutely care that it sells well. If it doesn't, then they stop making games in that franchise.


It depends on the studio. Obviously a corporate giant like Nintendo can market their games to hell and back. But smaller studios and "AA" ones generally don't have that same money to spend on advertising so demos generally aren't going to be done all the time.


True, but smaller indie studious generally don't have that luxury. You're way less likely to see non-AAA studious come out with demos for that reason.


I live in a country where libraries have no presence. I guess you can't win them all


Sry I have to, A country where Nintendo has no presence rules out europe, North and South America, Australia, Japan maybe South Korea, Russia and some parts of Africa. China, the Middle east or some African country comes to mind. Mongolia? North Korea?


It had like 50 people on it for 4 years, Dread was not a cheap game to make


Search engine optimisation. Making sure enough people (and the right people for your product) find your site or online storefront. 

For example, making sure the keywords people use to search for your thing, actually appear on the website. If people are searching “Metroid Switch” instead of “Metroid Dread”, you want to make sure the search engine directs the user to Metroid Dread and not some other random thing.


Probably search engine optimization, ie the big N is hopefully finally getting their heads out of their asses and starting to pay attention to the internet at large like basically every other major or for that matter minor brand name that exists right now. Rant over, lol


I feel like that was VERY much intentional on Nintendo's part, it's not actually standard (and I have no idea why), but they really seem to be doing everything they can to get Metroid to succeed.


You are correct, most games are shit, AAA and quality indie games are a small percentage of the total games available.


Didn’t see that one guess that’s fair then


They’ve done a few yeah, just none have felt as thorough as this to me, this is the only demo that’s really SOLD a game to me is what I mean


That might have been the case with me.  I've played just about every Metroid in existence, and I find Dread too frustratingly difficult and confining.  It loves to lock you into short sections until you beat a sequence of brutal encounters.  To me, the pinnacle of the 2D series is Super Metroid, which excels at opening itself up to the players as they progress.  If I had played the Dread demo before buying, I probably wouldn't have bought the game.


Look, at the end of the day, what’s good for the consumer and good for the company sometimes line up and sometimes don’t. 

But just like I don’t think that companies should go out of their way to adopt egregiously anti-consumer practices, I’m not going to expect them to spend their own time and money developing ways to discourage me from spending money on their product.

It’s a balance. I think there is a difference between doing something being consumer friendly and not doing it being anti-consumer.

Some things are decidedly anti-consumer if the company fails to do them. Some things are just nice to have, and are very consumer friendly if they do but not anti-consumer if they don’t. Free shipping is consumer-friendly but having to pay for shipping is not anti-consumer, for example.

I consider free samples to fall into the nice to have category. It’s definitely consumer friendly to be able to try a product out for no obligation before purchasing it, but I also don’t think companies are obligated to let you try out their products and services for free or else they’re anti-consumer, either.

You’re free to disagree.


I think you got downvoted for contradicting the guy you replied to.  Egos are a terrible thing, but we all have them.  I upvoted you, because I think you're right.  But that just got you back to zero as of this post.


DLC should not exist the game should be full at start and then if you want to expand it there should be significant amount of stuff to get like xenoblade 2


I’m glad I’m not the only one who screws that up repeatedly!


It probably is bigger, but the Knight moves
Far slower


Yeah...there are plenty of examples. Wolfenstein 2 I beat in 9 hours, that was $60. But I guess cause it's 3D it gets a pass? Don't know, it's just odd. Maybe there was a benefit for buying Game Boy games for like $50 growing up haha.


Yeah I remember people complaining about God of War 2018 only taking 30 hours to beat. That's insane, the original trilogy combined is 30 hours.


I'm a little biased cause I'm at the age where 60 hours is like...two months' play haha. So for me, 10-20 hours is something that I know I'll finish and won't get tired of.


You're right about Hollow Knight but I don't remember Ori being significantly longer than Metroid. howlongtobeat says it's about 11.5 hours and many people say that that's about their playtime on Dread, just the in-game clock doesn't count continues and such.


I dug the game and paid full price for it. I would again. But I think this is a fair criticism and I don't know why you're being downvoted.


Definitely! I had more than a few games that I was just happy with the shareware version of.


Hum... Pretty convincing. There are a lot of things in this game that I like very much.


Yes. And some people can run a mile in 4 minutes.

My point is, this is a 10-15 hour game for the average Joe.

I don't know why people's speed run times are being held up as a criticism, simply because it's popular among speed runners.


i often find a lot of deals around the 2 for £60 mark at christmas time or just after. that’s how i got luigi’s mansion and yoshi last year


True, I may be waiting a while! I did snag Pikmin 3 Deluxe for $30 at Target earlier this year so it is def possible! And GameFly often has some great deals on switch games! https://www.gamefly.com/browse/store/switch-store-usedbestsellers


You can find them if you look hard enough. All my first party games have been ~£25.


Thanks for asking nicely! :) I’m not saying it shouldn’t be priced at $60. It is worth $60 to many people, and it really looks like a great game.

For me personally(as I stated) I am not ready to spend $60. It’s just not my favorite genre, I have no past history with Metroid(not invested in the story/characters), have many other games in the backlog or things I would rather buy and play. 

Everyone is willing to spend different amounts on what they like. For example some people may spend $60 on Just Dance and get tons of fun out of it, while others wouldn’t find that price worth it. I wasn’t trying to diss the game in anyway…but we all know you can’t have an unpopular opinion on Reddit without getting downvoted!


Not OP (and am somebody who preordered Dread, which I rarely do) but it’s not unheard of.

• not everybody loves 2D games 

• not everybody loves Metroid, at least not with a $60 fiery passion

• backtracking is a dealbreaker for some people

• getting lost without waypoints is not everyone’s favorite way to spend their free time

• they have other unplayed games in their backlog they’d prefer to tackle first 

• they have other unpurchased games they’d prefer to buy first

• just don’t have time to play games at the moment and can afford to wait

• even a high-quality indie game in this genre with polished gameplay goes for $20, can’t justify spending the equivalent of three of those on one game if they’re not in love with it

Everyone’s different, no game is for everybody. Dread was great and I hope it does well but it is a very specific thing targeting very specific people.


Like other people said. It's more than 10 hours. The in game clock doesn't count pausing the game or deaths. Playing the game once usually puts you at 15h factoring that in.


Too short for me to spend that much. If I’m spending that much it better be a game I can drain hours into.


Its*


Would love to see something like that at Ninty's.


> Most people won't believe it [...]

Honestly, I don't care. It's about **my** gaming experience and **my** wallet. This won't cause me sleepless nights.


cool story, bro


Odd timing, but sounds perfect. I'm one of the odd ones who has never liked a Metroid game, but I love the genre. Squirming over whether I should risk full price for a short game during a period in which I'm desperate for something to kill the next 2 weeks, the demo will probably at least help me make up my mind one way or the other. Ended up just starting a replay of Nier Automata instead for now.


Yeah, it takes a few tries to get their pattern down and figure out the weak spots and when you can do finishing moves.  Some attacks are really hard to avoid. It's still incredibly frustrating to die a thousand times and feel like you're never going to be able to beat them.


Because then Shadow of War or Assassin's Creed Odyssey happen. Developers needlessly stick grind walls in place to make you tempted to pay to skip the grind.


Because it’s tiring to have people discredit games you like because it’s shorter, and it’s pointless to post “its 10 hrs not worth it” when for many it absolutely is. Basically you got upset for the equal and opposite reason.

That, combined with the fact the time/$ mindset has led to many bloated games is really frustrating for people who enjoy tight fast paced experiences. 

Also, for the record, because Dread is so fast paced replaying remains fun forever, and i got like 70 hrs in it already. A games runtime to one completion is nearly totally irrelevant to how many hours I have in it.


Because of, everything I said in my comment.

The goal of a game is to finish it and see the credits, thus its true length is how fast one can finish it that the system can allow. The only reason it may take you a handful of hours instead of mere minutes is because you got stuck, or died, or whatever. That is not a true representation of how the game is. You can realistically get through the whole thing with minimal setbacks, if any, and that's what actually matters. Why would the average time be considered the true length? How would we get said time?

Let's go back to the Dread example. OP heard it takes 10 hours to beat. It took me just a little over 7. I'm fat garbage at Dread, yet still managed to beat it faster than whoever OP read/heard this from. Who's experience is more valid when trying to deduce the game's true length? Why would that be? It's really just an arbitrary line in the sand

Runs in games can be perfected, in fact Dread actively encourages this by timing you. Even a naturally long game like Persona 5 game does this as its about time management. As you complete more and more runs, you shave off just that much extra time. My first run of vanilla I needed multiple real life days to complete Palaces, by now on my third playthrough (second playthrough of Royal) I can get through a whole Palace in just a handful of hours. I've naturally learned more, I remembered solutions to puzzles, I know the layouts, I have more experience with the combat system, I can skip cutscenes if I so desire (which I actually have been doing for non-voiced, non-confidant dialogues).

Another example is Hyper Light Drifter. My first playthrough took me like 20 hours. Now I've played the game so much I can beat it in like 2, amd those runs aren't even minimalist, nor do I utilize glitches.

My point is, and inexperienced run of a game is not a true representation of how long it takes to beat, because you're inexperienced. The truest length of a game is the fastest possible speedrun


*with glitches

I don't count glitches personally, tho Th3Birdman (the one who made me conscious of this mindset) does


BotW is like, endlessly repayable tbh so that's a good choice. I forgot to mention replayability in my original comment oop

BotW is still a short game regardless tho. Right now the world record speedrun is just under 25 minutes. If we assume that is the most optimized possible run, that is the game's true length


The Handy Boy was the bomb as a kid. It was like the luxury upgrade for the system. It is SO ridiculous in hindsight! I remember blasting the Ballad of the Wind Fish from Link's Awakening on those speakers. Such a nostalgia trip!


Metroid games tell you the % of items you found when you finish them.


It has a percentage completion on the map and main menu


On your save file (and it should be on the clear screen like the other Metroid games but it isn’t 😤) there’s an item completion score


Holy shit do people think 100%ing refers to achievements?


We need achievements on switch ASAP


EMMis are a new mechanic for dread. But they are sort of building upon the SA-X from Metroid fusion. 

The SA-X though had a few scripted encounters where you had to run/hide from it for a bit. You won't encounter it again until the next scripted encounter (and then the boss fight where you actually stand a chance against it). Whereas the EMMIs each stay within their area until you destroy it with the omega canon. 

So I can see some people being equally bothered by both mechanics while some may appreciate the EMMI for having more depth. Or some may dislike the EMMI for being more intrusive.


I like the EMMI sections. They are a nice change of pace and as they got trickier I really had to plan my approach. The counter attack escape mechanic was great too, if they EMMI got you there was still a sliver of hope that you’d manage to squirm your way out!   

Three cheers for EMMI sections!


No.  Instant-death progress stoppers have never been part of Metroid.  *Never.*  I hate these too.  I don't like the direction they took the franchise, in fact.  Emphasis on brutally hard fights in locked areas instead of exploration.  You're basically guided by the nose from obstacle to frustrating obstacle.  Play Super Metroid (available in the Switch's SNES app) to see what I mean.  You still have challenging boss fights, but you can use your brain in addition to your twitch reflexes to find ways through them.  You can generally explore and find extra tanks and missiles.  It's all about finding your way in the world, and obtaining the means to do so.


after i beat it, i immediately jumped into a hardmode run. currently working on 100%ing all of the areas before i finish it again.


That’s right, I actually play games for enjoyment. If I want to do hours of monotonous boring shit I’ll do some house work or go dig a garden bed or something of that nature IRL. At least there’s some benefit to that.


I also enjoy playing short games, but prefer for them to go on a large sale, which Nintendo will probably never do with this game, sadly.


F2P games are such a weird beast, they'll either be the cheapest game you play, or quite possibly the most expensive.  The F2P model exists because it squeezes out more money per user than upfront pricing.  Just look at all the mobile games that make over a billion dollars a year.  Once the game gets their hooks in someone they can really suck them dry.


Tbh I often pause games while preparing food or other stuff. Sometimes for hours. Pause should definitely stop the clock.


> Dying over and over while fighting a boss is most certainly playing the game. Some bosses took me over an hour to beat, and there are many bosses. That's a lot of inaccurate timekeeping!

Map definitely doesn't count against your time; I verified it by leaving game paused for like an hour and saving, then comparing before/after play times on the title screen and seeing that it only changed by the few seconds it took to reactivate the save point.  

However, I don't know how accurate the "deaths don't count toward your time" claim people keep making actually is.  I saw everyone saying that, so I played my second run through using the "restart at checkpoint" choice after deaths, and it bit me in the ass.

You see, on the second playthrough I did, I wasn't quite playing for pure speed but I was skipping stuff to save time while goofing off with a bunch of sequence breaking stuff, which resulted in me getting a bunch of stuff out of order and saving just before the final boss with a time 03:49:50 and no space jump. I knew the last boss would be a pain in the ass without space jump, but I was *so close* to being under the 4 hour mark, so I decided to just skip it and finish because the final fight and end sequence aren't that long...

Except I kept getting my ass kicked due to the lack of space jump (plus a lack of energy tanks).  Took me a while to get the hang of not getting destroyed by phase 2 especially, about 30-ish minutes of real-life time dying and going back to checkpoint.  So, when I finally beat it, the final time was 04:25:34. That means ~30 odd minutes of boss-die-checkpoint-repeat turned into ~30 odd minutes added to my play time.

That sounds a lot like dying and choosing to respawn at checkpoint *does* count against your time.  However, going back to title screen instead, which then loads you at your last save point instead of the point right before a boss or EMMI room, verifiably does *not*.  It's possible that **manually** reverting to the checkpoint instead of dying doesn't count, though? Haven't checked that yet.


Dread's world is specifically designed like a funnel so that you pretty much never get lost and always end up in the right place.


White EMMI (the first one after the damaged tutorial EMMI), right before obtaining Spider Magnet


take out the spaces between your spoiler tags.


Up to the first boss.


Yea, but the first one being the broken EMMI which is a tutorial, so we mean the same one


Can confirm. I finished the demo after playing blind and it took me about 3 hours. I did a second play through and it took me less than one.


Monster Hunter demos can't capture the core loop of the game properly, and they generally make the game out to be far more difficult than it actually is, which I think turns a lot of people off to it.


Having terrible demos is basically a Monster hunter tradition. You just can't throw a new player into a hunt with preset gear and expect them to have the faintest clue WTF they're doing.


I've actually been really enjoying playing voice of cards so far (~4 hours in), but I have heard that the demo pushed a few people away from the game.


Huh. Demos really are a double-edged sword because I actually enjoyed the Triangle Strategy demo. The narrative, though slow-paced, really gave the atmosphere and tension needed in preparation for a battle, especially with the decision part. That is what I liked about Final Fantasy Tactics. Story-driven tactical gameplay.  
Though I could see why you would say the game is boring. The slow pace will put off some people.


Same. After the first battle, I stopped for the day. The next time I turned it on, I played for a half hour and didn’t even get to the second battle. Holy shit they need to trim that down.


I can only imagine how boring Triangle Strategy must be when you came from Octopath, loving it. I thought Octopath was almost unbearably boring. It is probably one of the most boring games I've ever played. This doesn't sound good for Triangle Strategy...


Exact same situation as you. I was super hype, then I tried playing the demo and… it was pretty unplayable to be honest.

Bad press from somebody who made the choice to buy a game and then disliked it is only somewhat important if you're not a big company with lots of fans and lots of praise already.

A demo might be good for small publishers and indie devs. But for Nintendo, it's best to make the undecided buy the game, reap that benefit, ignore the bad reviews (as long as they're a minority), and wait for the hype to die to THEN release a demo for those who didn't cave in to peer pressure and novelty.


> It's probably better for you to download the demo and not like it and not buy the game than it is for you to buy the game, hate it, and then trash it online for how terrible and what a ripoff you thought it was.

It's not obvious that avoiding the negative impact of a single customer is worth losing a $60 sale. We're not that important.


The problem with MH demos is that they always seem designed to hype up the game for returning long-time players who were already probably going to buy the game, not players who are on the fence.


okay so I loved mhw but I HATED the rise demo cause I didn't remember anything and you drop me in against a mid level monster??? come on Capcom


People always say those demos are for returning players to see the new mechanics, not new players. So where's the demo for the new players, then? It's a lot of money for a game that has a demo that I didn't like.


Not long-term wise.


Thank you, I consider that a sincere compliment.


Yeah, honestly, RPGs are generally like this, and I may be putting my hand on fire, but Hack n Slash games too, I freaking love DMC and Bayonetta, but when the games get really good is until you buy atleast 3-6 diferent moves or unlock another weapon, and it is almost law to buy the move that let you move while attacking (Stinger in DMC, in Bayonetta you have many options, ABK is maybe the one with more mobility), it isn't as problematic as JRPG but still the genre usually takes some time to become total joy as you unlock moves, weapons and in some cases, a gauge to activate something.


Steam has it down. refunds given before 2 hours of playtime or within 2 weeks, whichever is sooner.


I barely played donkey kong country and yooka laylee as i was not enjoying them. But i am stuck witht them. 

(I like platformers, loved odyssey.)


I don’t care about Metroid


India


Oh, I didn't mean Dread is a cheap game in any way. However, I'm pretty sure Prime 4 has a pretty lofty budget (especially considering it's been rebooted after who knows how many years of development) and is still a couple years from release.

I'm sure Nintendo is going to do whatever is necessary to hype up the game and recoup their investment. And if that means smaller Metroid releases in the meantime, well, go for it.


Yes but Prime 4 is probably a massive money sink for them at this point. Restarting development is not cheap. There's a chance they can't make back what Prime 4 costs.


It's the first new 2d Metroid content in 19 years. Yeah, we had 2 remakes of the terrible 1st and 2nd games, but that's not new content. Metroid spawned an entire *macrogenre* of games, of it didn't live up to it's predecessors, the IP would die.


There are so many worlds in Hollow Knight, all very large. Samus moves faster in Dread but even in early game without her speed booster or flash shift she can traverse an area pretty quickly. The map screen is a little deceiving in Dread because it makes it look larger than it is.


Yes sorry I didn't mean to suggest Ori was much longer, just that the price is much lower. I looked at the stats recently and if I recall, Ori was actually the 2nd highest dollar amount per content volume behind dread, and was still less than half of what dread was charging


yeah i would say they're about 30% of the game? maybe a bit higher, but much more of exploring and other bossfights.


>only a hardcore Metroid fan will be able to beat this in 8-10 hours

100% because of this singular statement.

Also, I'm a hardcore Metroid fan, and I was about 20 hours actual playtime before my 100%.


That’s an awesome attitude I wish more people could state their opinion like you.


Yup, I’m similar to you. was reluctant to buy it at 60, but found some random old games to trade in and got it at $30, and couldn’t have been more pleased. Honestly after beating it though I’m like I definitely wouldn’t have been pissed paying even $50


Yea, i think the frustration in the community comes from matter of fact statements discrediting the idea that a 2d Metroid could be worth 60$ and anyone who thinks that it is worth 60$ is an idiot. 

The game to me is well worth it.


Exactly all these things - hit the nail on the head! Thanks for the response and glad to hear you enjoyed Dread! I hope to be able to play through it in full one day :D


[deleted]


I don't want to sound mean, but being poor doesn't justify being a thief. Live within your means. If you can't afford a $60 game, then don't buy a $60 game. Replay a game you already own, buy a cheaper game on sale, or do something else with your time. The world doesn't owe you the ability to play any game you want any time you want. You are basically saying that you would shoplift a game from a walmart to "try it out" and then go back and pay for it if you liked it. It's a crazy concept. If you are that tight on funds then you shouldn't be buying new games at all.


>Because it’s tiring to have people discredit games you like 

It really shouldn't have an emotional impact on you. Hell I agree with you, I barely play games longer than 20 hours these days, but saying you wish people would stop having an opinions because their opinion is "tiring" to you is peak reddit gamur mentality


A true representation of game isn’t a speed run of it. By that logic we should calculate a run of Persona 5 Royal as 15 hours instead of 100. Now I haven’t seen a speed run of it, but that likely means skipping all cutscenes and dialogue, doing few if any social links and knowing the best personas and all weaknesses. At that point you might as well just not play it if that is the true way.  P5R might be my favorite game of all time, but I wouldn’t turn it on to experience just the combat and simple puzzles.


This is dumb as shit lol


Dread also gives you percentages on the map, and per area too which is a nice QOL enhancement.


Thank you!


I'm pretty sure they just didn't know that metroid displays progress and an achievement saying you found 100% of the items would be an alternative way to let you know you completed it.


Some people do, which has always seemed weird to me. I've always felt like achievements were "outside" of the game, but some people think they're a part of its completion.


Yeah... beating the game is just beating the game. 100%ing is doing everything. That's always been my understand.


Nope. I just was curious how you would know without an achievement.


As I understand it you're only on rails up until you get the morph ball, and then the map basically opens up like classic Metroid. I'm not there yet so I can't confirm.


I do feel way more railroaded in Dread than traditional Metroids and I agree I don't care for it. So often I would get a new move and be exploring around a new area only to fall through a block floor and be blocked from backtracking. I like exploring and experimenting, finding my own way around, but Dread is much more linear in the way you move through the map. I'm not a fan of that. I also agree that the E.M.M.I. areas are annoying, espeically the purple E.M.M.I. that can see through walls.

That said, the gameplay is overall great. The moves work well together and combat is much more fluid and engaging than past Metroids, which I love. 

So for me it's definitely a mixed bag. I'd give the game maybe 8/10 overall.


As someone who sucks at games with thatvrequire twitch reflexes, I was able to beat Dread with ot a little difficulty, because there isn't a single fight in the game that requires twitch reflexes.    
      
Pattern recognition, timing (for counters), and the ability to effectively understand how to use Samus' movement options to avoid an attack are the only things that game requires in order to master a boss fight.


Yeah I can totally understand that. Best time this might go on sale is at least a year from now, if you're lucky. Either way it's your choice.


Pausing, yeah. If it's just that, a pause screen.

If we're speaking about a menu screen with options, a map, planning... Then it's part of the game.


This happened because *cutscenes* count for the ingame timer, even if you skip them. And there is a lot of cutscene time at the end, so your final time will always be around 30 minutes higher than the last save, whatever you do.

EDIT: I may be wrong. While cutscenes do count , this may not explain the discrepancy you've seen. I've seen posts saying the *last* boss fight only doesn't reset your time when you reset it upon dying.


Excuse me. We call him Stubbs


He was in the trailers, so it's not a spoiler either way.


*1st EMMI. If you follow the intended path, it ends after you beat the white EMMI

However, you can sequence break and get to the first boss early. The demo crashes after you beat it though


I completely forgot it would be out by now, I need to jump on it.


I've heard the game is really easy and short. For that type of game I would have loved a way longer experience than 6-7 hours and more voice acting. (Assuming people ain't lying)


oh is that out? I really enjoyed the demo. Perfect to play on a lazy Sunday


For me I enjoyed the demo, but the art really threw me off. Some of the character designs felt really out of place.


I prefer when give you the first hour or two of the game, leaving you wanting to continue playing to see what happens next. The Metroid demo is actually good example.  Pikmin, too.  

Not a fan when they just give access to random missions or sections from the middle of the story with no character development and a clunky tutorial.  

If they'd started from the start I might have been invested enough to sit through half an hour of story between gameplay, but that wasn't the case with that particular demo unfortunately!


I don’t think Octopath and Triangle Strategy are comparable gameplay wise. They have similar graphics, but are completely different types of games. I hated Octopath (bored me to death) but I’m really interested in Triangle.


If everyone liked the same thing, we wouldn't get to enjoy all the variety this hobby has to offer! 

If you didn't like Octopath, TS probably won't be your jam, but there's so many games coming out next year that you should have plenty to enjoy.


It seems to me like the story won't appeal to the same people at all. Octopath was very episodic, with no real overarching elements between the eight paths and sometimes barely a real connection between the chapters of a single character. The stories are incredibly small, easy to skip in favor of just jumping in to the gameplay. At best, they'll deliver a general mood or will surprise you with a line or two, but they're very basic.

Triangle Strategy wants to position itself as the new Final Fantasy Tactics, so they'll have to pull off an extended overarching story. They went from making a game that called for disjointed anecdotes more than a story, to one where the scale of the story will really define the final product. What's the point in designing a mechanic to sway side-characters and factions to your side if you don't spend significant amounts of time hearing what they think, what they want and who they are? By design, Octopath didn't need a good story for the gameplay to work. This one, by design, will need the characters to be compelling and act in a way that's not strictly predictable, otherwise the entire thing will be a wasted opportunity. I would be worried if Triangle Strategy didn't feature 20-30 minutes of reading between fights.


All I said was I found it boring and there was a lot of text.  I'm not sure what they would have changed that would address that?


I only played the v2 demo, so what you described might have been the first. You can still play the demo and you can choose which mission you want to go on with each mission having a different difficulty.


So get your ass kicked until you relearn? I don't get your complaint. There were two other easy fights you could do.


The investors don't give a f\*ck about "long-term", they want their money and they want it now


Seems to be working for EA


But thats kind of how we got here right? The Metroid games have always made the Metroid fans happy (cough cough go away Other M). We want sales to be great, even if the game isn't perfect for everyone. That way Nintendo can take the criticisms and make the next one even better. We won't get a next one if it doesn't sell well.


>donkey kong country

Yep, went on a spending spree when I got my Switch. I don't play a huge chunk of the games I bought.


Im aware, I have played HK. I think their map sizes are comparable with Dread’s being slightly larger but Samus just moves thru every room much faster


>and people who haven’t played Hollow Knight yet.

Huh, I’m giving Dread a shot because I played Hollow Knight and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would think there would be solid overlap between people who liked hollow Knight and people who would be interested in Dread.


So you calling people patronizing and telling me I’m emotional isn’t? 

Im not saying people can’t have that opinion, I’m saying after having many people tell me my opinion is invalid because it’s short is kinda tiring, you ask why the OP “wished” it wasn’t a thing, and that is the answer. 

You invalidated the OP’s opinion, told him he was patronizing, and ignored a rational explanation thru insulting… that’s also peak reddit my friend.


>A true representation of game isn’t a speed run of it. By that logic we should calculate a run of Persona 5 Royal as 15 hours instead of 100.

If that's the world record speedrun, then P5R is, in fact, 15 hours for a minimalist run getting the true ending.

I ask you again, do you not shave more and more time of each consecutive run due to now having max social stats, stupid powerful personas, and enemy weaknesses now being recognized by the game off the bat?


>At that point you might as well just not play it if that is the true way

I never said the world record speedrun is the true way to experience the game, just that it's the truest length. Two different things

>P5R might be my favorite game of all time, but I wouldn’t turn it on to experience just the combat and simple puzzles.

I mean, speak for yourself.

I already said that I my current playthrough I skip pretty much all dialogues except for voiced lines and Confidants. My favorite part of P5R is the combat, that's why I chose to replay it. I'm also currently reading the manga, tho it's slow going as I wait for localizations and such. Once I have the full manga, subsequent playthroughs will likely have all visual novel segments fast forwarded as the manga will just be a more digestible way of experiencing the story itself. I like the cutscenes so I wouldn't skip those. Like, in all honesty, this game gets pretty tedious on subsequent runs if you don't FF. I forgot how borderline boring the stretch between Madarame and Kaneshiro's Palaces are


And yet you nor anyone else can actually make an argument against it


So did Samus Returns, and most Metroidvanias of the last few years


The map also flashes rooms where you missed items. I was very thrilled to never have to look up a single item guide


Maybe I'm misunderstanding where you're coming from, but you're aware the idea of game progression existed long before achievements right?


Sort of not the case. There's a lot of backtrack shortcuts that are blocked off till lategame kittens are obtained, and there's a bunch of one way areas that you have to travel almost the whole planet to get back around.

My biggest complaint is that hell-runs and lava dives are impossible.


what do you mean? the morph ball is LITERALLY the first thing you get in every metroid game. its like the foundation of the game is morph ball first..


Excellent new video from Game Developer's Toolkit today that explains ["Why you didn't get lost in Metroid Dread"](https://youtu.be/5pop-cc9kmY). 

Starting Dread soon and I have mixed feelings about the "hand-holding". Like, it is frustrating to explore and keep hitting dead ends, but it's also way less satisfying to feel like you don't have a choice or don't have to explore.


Wouldn't Stubbs be the first Emmi, the damaged one with the missing claw/hand, i.e., a stub?


I only ever watched the reveal trailer and avoided all other media of the game up until launch, so I was actually surprised to see him in the game. Glad I wasn't spoiled on it beforehand


I never bothered to watch the trailers because I’m not interested in Metroid, so I was spoiled that a character I’ve heard the name of is in the game :(

Maybe I’m wrong, but as an outsider, isn’t that the same thing as putting a spoiler tag around Bowser Jr’s name? Like, maybe he’s not there 100% of the time, but from what I’ve seen he doesn’t seem to only be a rare appearance that deserves a spoiler warning.


He's been in almost every metroid to date, if not literally every title, it'd be a spoiler to say he WASNT there


Anyone "thinking about" buying this game probably isn't a metroid fan and probably doesn't know who or what that is.


Ty, I haven’t played it myself but I’d heard that you can get up to the first boss after the white EMMI but the demo ends before fighting him.


Not played the full game but I've seen footage of what people are referring to as the first boss >!the monster that turns invisible!<. While its not as exciting a fight I still feel like the Mother Brain type battle that's included in the demo would be the game's first bossfight and the post-demo boss would be the second. You're locked into a room against an enemy that was built up by cutscenes as you approached, has loads of health and can't be damaged by regular shots. At the very least its a miniboss.


The game is on the easier side. The regular mobs are definitely easy, but I've had a few characters die during boss fights. Haven't had a party wipe out yet or anything like that. I'm okay with that level of difficulty - this game feels like the video game equivalent of an audiobook, especially with the narration style. Kind of like something cozy to enjoy, not something to induce stress.

I'm 8 hours in now, but I did grind the card game mini game for an hour or two to unlock some extra customization options. The harder rulesets are very RNG based so it takes a bit of luck to win.

I'm on chapter 5 and I think there are supposed to be >!7 total.!< Some of the reviews I saw suggested 10-15 hours of gameplay, which sounds like what my pacing is. I like to fully explore the dungeons and get every chest too, though.


Yeah, they did pull some character designs out of context into the demo. The demo is a prologue story, the real game has a different storyline with different protagonists. So you won't see the same stuff. 

For example, the demo has a >!really buff guy that allows you to take his boat across some body of water to get to a cave.!< In the demo, that is definitely an out of place character design, but in the full game, that character >!is in an area where there are a lot of muscle-y bodybuilder types!< so it makes a bit more sense.

Some of the more generic NPC designs are reused throughout the game though, which is a little unfortunate but not a deal breaker.


I wholly agree with you. I was engrossed with how they presented the graphical quality, tactical gameplay and narrative pace in the demo that I clearly have completely ignored that character development had little presence in it.


If it's like Octopath or Bravery Default there will be another demo.


You're right, but they're wrong.


Oh yeah? Well I think that Samus moves fast but the map is big, while hollow knight has a slightly smaller map that takes much longer to traverse.

(Yall have been making the same exact point for like 3 or 4 replies)


In your own words you’re referring to “consecutive runs” which a lot of people don’t do and a lot of games with longer playtimes simply aren’t designed around. The first playthrough of a game is the one that matters most, you only get one chance to make a good first impression on your consumers and it’s the metric of ‘average first playthrough time’ that companies observe because they want maximum player engagement and time spent in game.

I feel like your original point of ‘avg completion time shouldn’t sway opinion as much’ kind of got a little lost in here, which is a shame because I 100% agree. I don’t think using speed runs as a metric is the right answer though, so much of that time spent engaging the player with characters, dialogue, set pieces, cutscenes etc is all lost when you just try to blitz through as fast as possible, this is especially true for the earlier example of P5R. I personally love speedruns but that should only ever be half of what you get out of a game at most, without a great first time experience behind it to suck you in and make you want to come back to it it’s difficult to justify repeat playthroughs.


Even Fusion and Zero Mission told you whether you had collected all Missile/Super Missile/Energy/Power Bomb tanks in an area. A % is better of course, but Metroid has been pretty helpful in this regard for a long time.


Metroidvanias are kind of special in that regard, as they had a completion percentage before achievements existed. 

What’s a 100% run of FF7? Does it include levelling all materias to max or just finding them? Do you need to find every final limit break? Do you need to get a high score on every minigame etc? Or a 100% run of SMB3, does it include every white ship or just completing the game without using warp zones?

Achievements did define how you quantify a 100% completion for most games.


Yea, I’ve been playing games since 1986. What I was curious is how he could be so confident it was a 100% completion run since the game is still new and there could be secrets no one found yet, ect. Didn’t realize the game itself told you.


In dread there's a significant chunk of game prior to getting the morph ball upgrade. You still spend the majority of the game with it but I've "finished" the first major area and still have yet to get it.


You do have a choice, which is why that video mentions sequence breaking. And when the game opens up you can explore to find all the inaccessible items you've been teased with throughout the game.    
    
Honestly, the game handles exploration in a far more elegant way than previous metroids. 

The classic metroid formula that video vouches for is ultimately one that prioritizes exploration as either a trual-and-error game or memorization game. In other words, mastering navigation relies on familiarization rather than problem solving or another form of skill-based learning.    
    
In contrast, Dread continuously puts the player into smaller areas that act as environmental puzzles to be solved. For instance, exploration of an EMMI area matters because understanding how the various areas relate to each other is vital to survival. Mastery relies on the player's ability to overcome discrete instances designed to test their navigational skill and traversal abilities.      
     
As far as I'm concerned, self-contained instances of exploration-as-a-challenge are far superior to larger instances of exploration-as-a-chore.


>Starting Dread soon and I have mixed feelings about the "hand-holding". Like, it is frustrating to explore and keep hitting dead ends, but it's also way less satisfying to feel like you don't have a choice or don't have to explore.

Just finished Dread about 2 weeks ago and this is one of the worst parts, for me. Without any spoilers, I was backtracking any time I could for like a quarter of the game but at some point I realised, backtracking is totally not worth doing everytime you get a new item so I stopped doing that until like 5 rooms before the final boss.  


I really liked the game but most of the time you want to backtrack, you'll suffer and pretty much waste time (at least in my experience). I also just watched that DG Toolkit vid and KingK's 2D Metroid Retrospective that he released like 2 weeks ago (no Dread spoilers) and it kinda helped me see the problems more clearly.


Me too! I avoid trailers pretty strongly because they almost always end up being spoilee, even when people say they aren't.


The difference with Metroid is that it has continuity. This boss reappearing is a surprise because he was thought to be dead. Bowser Jr isn't a spoiler because all Mario games are standalone and don't have much in terms of plot anyway.

Personally I didn't look at any Dread media after the initial announcement so finding him was a cool experience.


No, he hasn't. Literally only in Metroid 1 and Super Metroid up to now.


>Not played the full game but I've seen footage of what people are referring to as the first boss the monster that turns invisible.

Because it is the first major boss. Those "Mother Brain-like" fight you mentioned (It is called a Central Unit in-game) is just a miniboss, again, like you said in your last sentence

Think of it as the demo makes you fight a miniboss and ends it right before the 1st major boss, like most other demos (the first boss isnt right after the white EMMI but you dont need to progress very far to reach it)


Maybe the first 2 hours is filled with lots boring dialog.


I hope so! Otherwise, I'm happy to wait for user reviews.  I'm still interested, this was just an example of a demo being a disservice to the game if not executed well.


Depends on the circumstances too though. Metroid developers are wrong bc it’s a name brand series. Long term is important and they probably have the funds to survive a less than stellar sale of a single game. A game like hollow knight has to earn the money at that moment if they want to survive because there is no guarantee they’ll earn more profits to cover their investors.


Prime hates you and refuses to help in that regard.


If I recall those games only showed completion rates after beating them once, unlike Dread which shows you completion rates from the get-go


Thank you. This is exactly what I meant. When someone says they 100% the game, I imagine not only beating the game but doing every single possible thing the game offers.


I think the other thing that made it worse was the long load times going between areas. While exploring I started planning my route based on how few transitions it would take to get somewhere.

When you backtrack after getting a new power, only to find that they blocked off more progress, then you have to go through all the areas back again.

I think that was the only thing that I really disliked about Dread. While I would have preferred a slightly more open routing, the game did manage to feel open without actually being which is pretty interesting to me.


It's way easier to clean up powerups post credits. After beating the game, if you reload that save the teleportals are unlocked and you can go to any of them instead of needing to use them in pairs.


Metroid 1, 3, and 5 so far

He is a pretty odd guy


Phazon Elite is how I know  Prime hated me


Prime 3 actually tells you how many items you've collected on the pause screen, so they eventually caught up.


Booooooo


A fairly odd pirate, if you will.


Also Zero Mission if we count remakes. We've seen him more often than we haven't.


He's in 60% of the main games in the series. Last I checked, that's still a majority.


As well as having the option to launch probes to show you the location of each collectable. That was cool. It still felt earned too.


Key being the user in question said 'every Metroid to date', not 'every main game' or 'every 2D metroid' to date.

big difference :shrug:


Finally, chongyun's idle quote is complete

>Heart be pure, evil be erased. Mind be purged, world be saved.


Shenhe is now officially auntie Shenhe


"Your temperature seems unusually high.... This one friend of yours hasn't mixed Jueyun Chili into your food again, right?"


What surprised me the most was that Shenhe is actually Chongyun's auntie, as in blood related based on his reaction in the demo


Asian mom moment


Every Asian kid is used to this growing up, lmao.


Wow Shenhe looks so bea~~uti-~~

**CHONGYUN CONTENT**


pls it was so badass and cute and the same time. definitely one of my favorites, perhaps i'll roll?


Chongyun, after realizing she's his auntie: Shen-huh?


Maybe this will explain why Shenhe dislikes Xingqiu? Because Xingqiu always play tricksters on Chongyun.


This is precious.


This demo made me want to roll but I don’t have any crying dps and her in game model looks so dreary compared to the cutscene one


r/chongyunandme material


guys maybe it's not about his popsicle. maybe that's not why his temperature is hot. he ate peppers again SMH


This will inspire tons of fanart.


Fun fact : In asian culture(at least mine),Family hierarchy is taken seriously and some things are determined by that.It doesn't matter your age.How you are related by blood with other family determines your position in the family.So you can have a uncle or aunt who is much younger than you or a nephew or niece older than you.


For example,I have a cousin who is over 50 years old and her daughter who is 28 is my niece.I am only 21 but by hierarchy,I am in higher position than my niece lol.If she married and had a child,I will be a grandpa technically lmao.


[removed]


I was never interested in Chongyun until this demo came out. So he's related to Shenhe huh, I wonder if we'll ever see more from their family.


This got more upvotes than the actual demo post lol. Shows how Chongyun was the real star today.


I don't main Chong anymore but he will always be my favorite character


auntie stop, youre embarrassing me


Shenhot... You will be my tomorrow! MuaHAHAHA!


I need 200 chapters of this manga


Imagine you eat 40 ice creams a day to stay chill and then someone says your temperature is high


the next aunt Cass


she better self isolate 
For 14 days if Chongyun has COVID symptoms?.


Are they the first playable pair of blood relatives? They beat the Kamisato siblings to it it seems
Edit: whoops there are the traveller twins and Jean + Barb


This made me smile, truly awesome


Chongyun was my first character I started with. My first lv 90, and then was slowly back seated as the game hardly holds a place for him. I’m so excited to get his full value with shenhe :) love her


Move over Auntie Eula, the real Auntie's in town.


I’m so scared for all the ship stuff I know is going to come from them


so my hsbando is my waifu's nephew now. That's  interesting 🤔


My heart can take my boy finally having family. If only I was interested in her kit or had any cryo characters that needed buffing. Although needing C6 for that full potential and no limits would be hard to get…


Hottie auntie


The fact that he isn’t ice-cold is the biggest surprise here 

edit: lmao sorry guys i haven’t done his hangout yet


Was skipping but when I saw this Im insta pulling tomorrow.


very wholesome auntie nephew moment


"Hey, Auntie"


People will make and upvote comments about them having sex / how cultured the 'oneeshota' tag is and then wonder why everybody else thinks this community is full of pedophiles lol.


This explains chongyuns new voice line about her, I’ve been wondering if he’s her son or smth


The real question is, will Xingyun come out stronger or weaker after this reveal.


people who ship them are ew


I thought she would be his mum


this was almost as strong as eula sneeze kind of bait 😰


This was so cute 😭 I hope we see more in game interactions with them that would be amazing- :/ I can only dream


This has, predictably enough, sparked a debate even worse than the Kaeluc situation. Fantastic.


How? He literally eats a popsicle every minute 😅


Next episode, aunt is stuck


They are fuking related stupid community


I'd be hot too if I were Chong in that instance. Nothing to do with Yang energy.


oh my...temperature


This is literally all hosed out when chongyun goes "wait ...that means ur my auntie?"


Pointing to Traveller, "He is your new uncle, Chongyun", Shenhe said.


xq don't like it


I swear, Chongyun NEEDS to be part of Shenhe's story quests. I want a real family moment because the traveler's sibling won't let us.


You can almost hear the fanfics writing themselves.


Doujin artists at full swing


I can already tell some of u sick people will some nasty stuff about this 🤢😂😂😂


I was about to ship until I realized that apparently they’re blood related. 😞

Chongyun didn't know she was his aunt at this point so I'll forgive him for getting a bit hot watching her.


I'm confused, does this mean Chongyun is adepti? Or a half adepti?


My man simped for his auntie lmao


He's gonna get her pregnant tonight


Chongyun be horny rn


too hot :D

shenhe: nice popsicle you got there

Chongyun: 😥

later... 🥵


Chongyun has always been a favourite character of mine even though I barely use him in my comps. I wasn't going to pull for Shenhe before but now I want to more than ever. Sucks that I've got too much cryo and I really want kazuha to come home soon

Xiangling and my char after his hangout: "What chili?"


Idk, my temperature would probably be high if I was around her too.


Achievement: Use the wrong recipe and ~~just fucking murder Chongyun~~ provoke Chongyun's pure yang spirit.


I read somewhere that in CN, Chongyun calls her something that means "Mom's younger sister". She could be in her twenties. I myself became an aunt as soon as I was born hahaha


Yeah,how old is she?30 or 40?still very hot anyway.


His “About Shenhe” voiceline (leaked before this came out) shows us the moment he realized Shenhe would be his aunt based on how their family tree is structured. It’s pretty funny. 

I assume that if the voicelines are taken as any sort of canon, this interaction occurs after that since he identifies Shenhe as his auntie after realizing who she is.


Wasn't it obvious they were related? Since the first time they showed her I knew she was a exorcist.


I had a sneaking suspicion she was related somehow based on Xingqiu's comment about her:

>I find that Miss Shenhe seems to look at me somewhat fiercely, so I daren't approach her lightly. Bizzare, did I inadvertently upset her? Or maybe... upset someone close to her?

However, without any further information, I was just grasping at straws.


I think I read somewhere, that aunty for China can just mean elder but idk so don’t take my word

Edit: Misunderstanding


- You should drink more water

- You been eating too much heaty food

- You've been using your phone too much


Kid: Mom, how should I call this auntie?

Mom: well, it’s complicated…


I personally feel this as the second youngest of my generation with multiple cousins 5-10 years older.


Even after growing up


I always feel that putting another character in a specific 5 star trailer as a cameo or for a short time enhances the quality. Bonus points for when they are somewhat connected and we see their interaction. But standalone trailer also have their own charm too

Boy oh boy, does Chongyun have good news for you.


I have this ongoing thing called Family Reunification Project. It obviously doesn't work, since I don't have Diluc, Klee, Ayaka (for my future Ayato), and now I won't have Shenhe, because I want to pull Xiao. So yeah, me too also almost want to roll for Shenhe.

That is the most bizarre subreddit I’ve ever seen lmao. What’s the backstory/tea?


Just gonna hope it's the wholesome kind.


“Fanarts” someone add that face for me plz


hopefully not any with broken arms


Oh no


I'm still curious why chongyun and shenhe hardcore nsfw more well received than diluc and kaeya holding hand?(I'm not shipping them btw).


"What are you doing step-aunt?"


Relatable. It's super awkward when my much older cousins calls me big sister because her dad is younger than mine and I'm like...I know this is our language and all but it feel so strange!


Hmmm so I guess I'm a uncle


i’m egyptian so not asian but have the same thing. one of my father’s cousins is younger than me but to me she’s like an aunt but i never called her that whenever i realize it tho i’m just like uhhh..... hmmm..... okaaaaay.......

also one of my father’s cousins’ who’s the oldest in the family by now is older than his own aunt by TEN YEARS. when she was born he’d play with her as a baby and the family would be like bruh she’s your aunt


Lol true I literally have a toddler nephew and I'm only 18


I think it's usually because Asian families generally tend to have more children. And since the age discrepancy gets bigger and bigger as the family gets bigger and bigger, you sometimes get uncles and aunts who are younger than you. Like in my case, I'm 23 years old but I'm technically a grandpa. My niece (who I treat as cousin, btw) was older than me by a year. She had a baby at an early age, so technically I'm a grandpa now and my parents are great grandparents. I also have a nephew (which again, I treat as a cousin) whose older than me by 10 years. Me and my siblings just treat them as cousins, cuz it seems more normal that way.


That's not just Asian culture, that's just the definition of aunt/uncle.

If you have a sibling way older than you and they have a child then you are that child's uncle/aunt.

It's just uncommon because usually the age gap isn't this big. You don't often hear about someone's brother being 25 years older than them.


YEEEEEESSSS
CHONGYUN BANNER!


this is me but with shenhe lol had no interest in her at all but now seeing her relationship with my fav popsicle boy i might roll on her to make his auntie come home


You mean shen-huh ?


Tbf, people are more likely to upvote image post because they can't bother clicking a link to Youtube.

If anything, the reason this got so much traction, is the Oneshota dynamic.

Lol'd at this. But she's by far the thiccest tall female character in the game. Shenhot!


Jean and Barbara


jean and barbara: Bruh


Travellers technically


Ayaka and Ayato will be. Semisiblings are Dilic and Kaeya (adopted) and Klee and Albedo (call each other siblings due to Alice). 

Qiqi and Baizhu have a father/daughter relationship. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. I think we'll probably have more as time goes on. I'm always a fan of more character relationships (family or otherwise).


Isn’t Shenhe Chongyun’s aunt?


me too...
but it's too late, read comments above. they're so excited for shenhe/chongyun vanilla hardcore incest doujin 😔.


that sounds like the title of a slice of life anime


There's a song about that I think it's called I am my own grandpa


He is >!pure Yang human being although his vision is cryo. He has to constantly consume popsicles to keep his body temperature low. !< It's in his quest.

Shenhe is mortal. Not adepti. Just trained with them for years.


Nope, Shenhe is not an adeptus, she just trains with them!


Neither, Shenhe is not an adepti

Cloud retainer took to her and raised her. The adepti are fond of her, that's it


Eh, Shenhe is 100% human. Just cursed, homicidal, isolated from the rest of mankind... And eventually taken under her wing by cloud retainer.


no, shenhe isnt even adepti to begin with

Yeah, I was actually referring to Xingqiu since he often pulls those pranks. Xiangling not so much


I meant Xingqiu. He likes to put chili into Chongyuns food

Edit: my bad, responded to the wrong comment lol


then maybe you have covid


Thats okay Shenhe has a cryo vision so she can cool you down!


> "Mom's younger sister".

Well isn't that an aunt?


I'm 7 years older than my aunt


shenhe is not old cope


Nah, that's just a generic term used for older women.  It's normal to use familial terms to address strangers.  For example, you might call a young adult male stranger "big brother" or an older male stranger "uncle".


You can have a very distant aunt/uncle that can even be as old or younger than you. For example, I have a nephew that is 25 while I’m only 16


I am 26 and my "nephew" is 19. 

It can get pretty convoluted


Aunt doesn't have to be your mother's sister. Your grand's sister's/brother's daughter can also be your aunt. My aunt irl is only 5 years older than me, my mom is 22 years older.


bruh.. my aunt (dad's youngest sister) is 2 years younger than me and the other aunt is same age as me.


depends if she has any sort of adpti-ness in her like Ganyu. Ganyu's like 100+ right?


She's still ripe too.


ZAMN SHE'S 40?! 🥵


Leak voicelines spoilers >!she thought he was threatening traveler when he whispered to them and xingqiu would have probably "dissapeared" if traveler didn't fix the misunderstanding immediately.!<


I think in this case, the specific Chinese word he used means his mother's younger sister.


I'm pretty sure they're blood related somehow, Chongyun's reaction in the end was in a form of shock rather than respect


Something as specific as *my* aunty 100% doesn't mean random elder woman here.


Auntie can be any woman in an older gen (usually your parent's). But the Chinese video calls her a word that is much more specific and used only for blood relations. So she is in fact his aunt; the English really should have dropped the -ie and saved everyone confusion.

(It might be because the Chinese calls her an aunt that is *younger* than your mom, so they kept the -ie to imply youth, but it's a bad translation and doesn't work well in English imo. Genshin EN makes a lot of weird choices.)


The general term for "woman quite some years older than you" is 阿姨 (ah yi, aunty). The term Chongyun used specifically was 小姨 (xiao yi, literally means 'younger aunt' but basically is a specific term for 'my mother's youngest sister'. And no, this xiao is not the xiao in Xiao's name). 

Chinese is a very specific language when it comes to age-based terms. We use different terms for paternal vs maternal grandparents, for older vs younger siblings, for different generations of relatives, etc.

Shenhe is a dedicated cryo support? **CHONGYUN META**

I know what I'm about, and I will not be deterred.


Agree. The presence of chongyun here made both characters better


Yes, definitely prefer to see them interact. It enriches the world, I think. They don't exist in a bubble, that you can transplant them anywhere else and it would make no difference.


Shenhe is a Chongyun support, pass it on


If you already have Zhongli or if you are pulling after Xiao, I call that a decent continuation of the project


I love themed groups. I can't wait for the next Klee banner so I can finish my Albedo group (little sister Klee, apprentice Sucrose, and penpal whose books he illustrates Xingqiu).


Thats what the guy you're replying to was saying. They dont want to pull because they dont have any Cryo DPS to pair Shenhe with


Well yeah, that's what they mean.

They have no c̶r̶y̶i̶n̶g̶ cryo dps for Shenhe to support.

there is a small movement called r/Waifuism  where people act like they are in a relationship with a fictional character to the point where they actually start to believe it. The girl that runs this subreddit is “in a relationship” with Chongyun.

I don't ship Diluc and Kaeya either, but without getting into whether or not one ships them that way + them being adoptive and what I've heard about the sworn brothers concept in China and the ways it can be interpreted... 

It's just some things being held to different standards ~~and why~~. So many people will immediately ship the most degen M/F like this (Chongyun is also one of the youngest feeling of the boy models) or rather support/want the porn of it for their fetishes, yet at the same time you'll always get a bunch of people saying gay pairings like Eula/Amber or Ganyu/Keqing only see each other as sisters (good friends) despite the characters never saying that out of their own mouth. But then when you get actual family with a nephew and his aunt and *this* happens. So with reddit's demographics I wouldn't be surprised if there are more people into straight incest than those who care for any kind of (platonic) relationship between Diluc and Kaeya.


It is even stranger for me because she was a teacher at my highschool lol.


My friends ask me if I know her and when I answered she is my niece,they all went "Wack?" Haha.


You missed the part "Taken seriously".I am not saying it is only asian thing definition.I am saying it literally impact the way you interact with other family members.


Western people don't seem to mind the uncle/aunt thing.They just take this as technicality.They will just interact with each other depending on age.


Not in my culture.For like family reunion for festivals and such,the interaction between family members largely depends on that relation.And so many things are still running on that hierarchy thing.


Ah, a fellow Kokomrade. Our social credit score will be legendary!


The literal fucking twins when you start the game


Jean and Barbara are sisters!? So thats the big sister barbara mentions in her voiceline.


**end credits sequence rolls out**


Correct on everything except Qiqi-Baizhu


That especially encourages shippers


That’s exactly what scares me


never stopped the internet before


I’ve played Chongyun’s hangout ((he’s one of my fav characters)) but I still don’t understand how pure yang energy works :,D ((I just learned through this post that Chongyun have a lot of chaos energy (?) ))


This is the way.


Incest is wincest after all

Genshin impact community genshin impact community


That's not a man

That's a shota


Sweet home….?


So it's a non-sexual relationship. Like traveler and paimon, no?

Still got potential for cute fanarts, interactions and scenes.


and?


I'm aware


Ah i see, my bad


Oh, i didn't know that


Wasn’t one of his voicelines something about Shenhe being his auntie? he says something like “There’s no way i’d have to call her “Auntie Shenhe” right…?”


nah , i'm just a good hunter


\*Guts theme plays*


Senhe: No happy. Only horny

Chongyun: B-but! You're my aunty!!

Senhe: Did I stutter?!


Doesn’t take a genius to figure that it’s all part of Mihoyo’s plan to get us horny so we open our wallets.

*looks at Mona*


[deleted]


Tbh this community is still not even close to being the horniest. Given how Genshin is much less mature than Gacha like Fate, Azurlane, Last Origin, etc, the community there makes Genshin community almost look family friendly.


you should take a look at Honkai impact 3rd community since it's also Mihoyo's game.


Horny if intended to be is not that surprising. There's way worse communities that sexualize the living shit out of random stuff.


It's an game where 70% of playable characters are female.It is *intended* to get you horny.


Everything is relative to what you know of.

And you know nothing, Jon Snow.


You should go to r/goodanimemes , that sub will make this sub feel normal


Yes, we proudly are!


Evil be erased!


I can feel the vibe


Aunt Alice when?


As a prank, iirc. Though if Chonggers rampages, Xinqqiu takes responsibility and pays for the damages.


Chongyun's vision, "Am I a joke to you?"


Yes, but unlike in English, naming family relations in Mandarin is quite complex and can be very specific, to the point where even native speakers may go "wait, how are we supposed to address <this relative> again?"

In Chongyun's case, the term he uses is typically for a mother's younger sister, as /u/TeamLValdz02 mentioned.


Yes, what they meant was the chinese term specified if shenhe was an older or younger sibling of chongyun's mother.


yes! but a lot of honorific-based languages usually have to distinguish whether the aunt is paternal or maternal, younger/older than your parent, or if they're an in-law to get the title correctly!

shenhe's title as "mom's younger sister" would be very different from, say, chongyun's "dad's older sister-in-law"


It is. But in Asian culture, a lot of times Auntie is just an honorific. I wanted to specify that Shenhe is his mom's younger sister because otherwise her familial relation to Chongyun would had been up in the air


Yup, it’s just Chinese words for relatives are more specific, e.g. there’s different words for “aunt” if the aunt is from the mother’s or father’s side / if the aunt is younger/older.


The Chinese languages are very specific about the exact relation. There are actually different words for grandmother and grandfather too based on whether it's paternal or maternal.


There are different words for aunt on your mom and dad’s side as well as if they are older or younger than your parent. Same with great uncles and aunts as well


My dad is my sister


Can relate. Got a distant uncle who just finished primary school, or at least close to. I'm well into my 3rd year in college


I’ve got a cousin who’s 20 now, and I know at least two people older than 30 call him grand-uncle.


Lmao same here, my mom married my step dad and I have a cousin who is 46 years old while I'm 20😂


yep, had a friend in high school who was going to school with her aunt that was in the year above us


I have two aunts that are only about 15 years old


Yep, me and one of my nephews are separated in age by a month, happens all the time.


I have an aunt who is 3 months older than me


I have a nephew that is the same age as me. He has a stable job, a wife and kid, I have Yanfei C6, we're pretty much on even ground.


The word he uses in Chinese is specifically for his mother’s younger sister.


Shit can get pretty convoluted in Chinese since we have different names for father and mother’s side of the family. 姑姑（Gu Gu）is the aunt on the dad’s side while 姨妈/小姨(Yi ma/Xiao Yi)is on the mom’s side. And when your uncle marries a woman that woman is called 舅妈 which is also aunt in English. Even grand parents have different words for them such as 爷爷奶奶 姥姥姥爷 外公外婆 etc depending on regions. In Chong yun’s case he meant mother’s sister for sure


She's not adepti at all, she's a human disciple of the cloud retainer. Ganyu is also 3000+ years old


Shenhe is a human who has been initiated along the path of immortal cultivation. I remember the old man from the shiki taisho event would also qualify for being something similar; he learnt adepti arts so would have improved his longevity.


It says in her profile that she drinks mountain dew so she likely has extraordinary longevity


Ganyu is atleast 3000 years old and Shenhe is a mortal. Assuming that she's Chongyun's Mom's younger sister, she shouldn't be very old


3000+... She's over 3000 years old.


Yeah, it wouldn't make sense if he was thinking "Oh my god, you're older than me, so I should call you auntie!" or something.


LMFAOO, the mobile one is waay too accurate.


This is so false. We don’t have Xbox es


You mean Gameboy/Nintendo.


&#x200B;

Add Eula & Albedo's trailers to that list, the cameos from Amber and Klee made them do memorable and fun.


YES


That's a pretty good point.


Ah okay


Please don't use terms like that when someone is just showcasing something they like. Especially when you play a game that is literally basically legal gambling 

I dont really see anything worth insulting them over with there.


Vin Diesel can tell him nothing is more important than family.


Oh no!

I see snakes surrounding a table?


so the reason is actually about the"gay ship"? 😭.
remind me with someone in one discord server. he called me disgusting when he found out I draw childe and zhongli as couple (soft kissing scene). but this same people who called me disgusting, also actively share klee lolicon doujin, or rape hardcore onee shota doujin in nsfw channel. glad I left that discord server.


Hahahah, feels good to meet other Kokomrade


You’re not wrong but for now you can’t have both twins on one acc


> The literal fucking twins when you start the game

You cannot play both of them


Cant blame em, sometimes I forget barbara exist


We know about that since 1.4


theyre half sisters i think


Basically yes. The game kind of assumes people already understand because it's Chinese feng shui.

The short version is that nature, including humans, has a flow of negative (yin) and positive (yang) energy. Yin is associated with order, calmness, stillness, darkness, cold and death. Yang is associated with chaos, intensity, motion, light, heat and life. Having too much of one or the other is bad for you, and feng shui is all about keeping the right balance, both through internally through inner peace, and externally by literally creating a "balanced" environment (ie kitchens are heavily skewed towards yang and bedrooms are skewed towards yin, so there's all kinds of complicated esoteric rules about exactly how to construct houses so that every individual room balances out, or else the whole place gets cursed).

Instead of having a natural balance of each, Chongyun was born a walking power plant of Yang energy that constantly builds up inside him and throws off the balance of everything nearby. This makes him a *super* good exorcist, since auto-smites all evil spirits in a mile radius without even doing anything (much to his own disappointment). But it's also a constant curse. Having too much yang energy means all the things associated with yang, like heat and emotion, get taken to an unhealthy extreme. He has to balance out his yang energy with yin from meditation, popsicles, the cold from his vision, etc.  If anything throws him out of balance again (getting worked up, eating spicy food), he'll literally overheat and turn into a chaotic emotional frat boy.


In xianxia webnovels sometimes characters might have unique constitutions they're born with, think like a bloodline in naruto.

Yang usually gets associated with fire, masculanity, life,sometimes ambition/recklessness/you know the trope, etc...

Yin usually gets associated with ice, femininity, death, serenity, etc...


Since chongus has a pure yang body he is basically genersting a ton of heat and might go a bit crazy for a bit if it gets too high.

~~not so fun info: usually in certain webnovels yin bodies can also grant vitality to people that have sex with them which results in them being sought after in certain novels for this reason~~

~~>!another not so fun info: in other certain trash novels yin body female characters might be the youngster of the clan or sect that stands above their peers while being unaware of their unique constitution, eventually yin energy might build up too much and result in them experiencing pains and such while hiding them or their parents not being able to figure out the reason, then you have the mc with pure yang body figure out the problem and suggest to "help" them by fucking.!<~~

Don't let your dreams be memes


😦


😐


That's okay!


Yes, but that's just a mistranslation. Well, not exactly a mistranslation actually, since there's kinda no word for it in english. 

But either way, auntie's (here) used for relatives older than you as a way to show respect. In the CN Ver of Shenhes demo I hear they used basically "younger auntie".


nice bro


Almost a year since Miura's passing. Damn...


We’d be straight up like onlyfans for anime characters if the CCP weren’t standing behind Mihoyo


More horny than the Fate Community? I though that universe had the most h-doujins of any series.


Imagine being gay in a fandom of a game full of girls, cant be me ,, haha


I'm convinced they created Eula to make people complain about climbing less.... prove me wrong.


Yeah Genshin got nothing on AL for horny


the honkai community is kind of hilarious that way. one second, it's all, "the story is really great. try to avoid spoilers. don't rush. who's cutting onions?" and the next, it's "segggggs wid big jiggle tiddiez grownup brONya!"


Just 70? Feeling generous with the ratio today, aren't we.


If you think the 30% of dudes aren't there to also get people horny, you are wroooong


That's why I said "One of the Horniest".


Mind be purged (post nut clarity)


>"wait, how are we supposed to address <this relative> again?"

I remember whenever an extended family member visited home for the first time, I would have an entire discussion with my mom and dad to figure out what the fuck I am supposed to call them 😭


> "how are we supposed to address <this relative> again?"

Ah yes, me during Chinese new year when my parents want to visit some relative I've never seen before.


Yeah...gotta remember the order they were born in, mother or father side, extended family or not etc etc. I've given up on understanding the complexities, I just think of it as their name, I'm not calling them anything else anyways.


Suddenly I remembered coming home for Chinese New Year, my parents introduced me to aunt, two aunt, three aunt, ，，，nine aunt, little aunt.


Where is the source that in CN, Chongyun uses a specific term to call her the younger auntie?


Or in the case of 小姨太, Dad's side piece.

Ands it used to be socially acceptable and even encouraged to marry 1st cousins in the same generation on the maternal side but not the paternal side. Sexism mostly, to believe that somehow your mom's genetics matter less in producing children with genetic disorders. Thank god that practice is out.


It could be something very specific to my upbringing. But I immediately assumed familial relationship with the word aunty. Chongyun’s surprise further validated it.


Why tf did this make me laugh


Wait wait wait.. didn’t this happen to Ted Bundy…


I'm my own grandpa


So your dad is trans and he had you with your other dad, who is also their dad?


My cousin(from my dad's brother side) is married to My another cousin (from my mother's brother side ).
So I am Confused what to call her.in my country we would call our brother's wife as "Bhabhi" ,which is kinda embarrassing to say for me at this age so I would stick to cal her sis.


My sister is my dad.


My two half brothers are younger than my 9 yr daughter


You got a link to the CN lines?


Mama i feel cold and have a headache.


Yep not allowed to have gaming consoles because it will distract from your studies.


Or how 2.3 trailer was practically Bennett's trailer lol


Sara's appearance in Itto's trailer, too.


Please go to the sub and really think about what they’re saying they have an unhealthy obsession and did you see the thanksgiving photo, in the comments they also mention them not talking to their family and putting on AirPods. Also the whole weird beef they have with a person and the whole idea of the sub. I mean cmon they genuinely believe they’re in a relationship with a **Fictional** character. It goes way beyond then just “showcasing something they like”


She really does need mental help. She isn’t just posting about something she likes, she genuinely believes she is in a romantic relationship with chongyun, and she’s completely obsessive about it, to the point where she carries around a cardboard cutout of chongyun to go on “dates”.


In what way is building a shrine anywhere close to sane? Like imagine if it was a real person, suddenly it'd be creepy as hell. But even being obsessed with a fictional character is still absolutely not normal.


How is it gambling? Not everyone uses money you idiot


Cyro and Delusion are stong but not as strong as family


I still feel bad for Gorou


I know, so sweet.


She actually does have some wholesome or normal art aw well.


I think OP didn’t know the gender of that person so they decided to use the gender neutral pronoun as to not accidentally offend anyone.

Edit: irony is that even though he tried to not offend anyone, someone still managed to be somewhat offended


[deleted]


These faces are amazing. How do I use em on Reddit? Just copy paste?


Holy shit I actually see it too now


 Where are the snakes and where is the table? I'm trying to see it that way, but I can't.

Edit: I think that I figured it out. In order for that to be seen, the white must be perceived as negative space


It’s a ahegao face


more like 1.0 \~ 1.1


full sisters. their parents separated.


nah; they are biological sisters. Their parents kinda divorced and went separate way; each took and raised a daughter following their respective career path. Because the sisters have been separated since they were small; they found it akward to communicate as siblings now.


What half sisters. They're sisters both in blood and law.


Omg thanks for clarifying! This is in-depth to me <3

That’s interesting that you mentioned yang is associated with fire🔥! because in Chong’s character profile it is revealed in the “Vision” section that and I quote:

>!”…One day, he will become the greatest exorcist in Liyue, control his abundance of yang energy, and rid the world of evil spirits.”!<

>!Perhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor — that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of "Cryo" rather than "Pyro."!<


Up until I read your explaination, I don’t see why Pyro need to be brought up, I know in Genshin lore theory that Pyro is a high drive of passion while Cryo is like something “opposite” in oneself. I thought since Chong is born —for lack of better term in my vocab- “chaotic” but tried his best to control the chaos in him, this action is more prevalent than passion. But now it’s clearer to me! Thanks a lot for your explanation <3


Because in Taoism they actually do believe all the sex thing. Hell, many of them practiced not nutting so they wouldn't eject yang energy.


Inazuma


The word ship itself can be used to mean non-romantic/sexual relationships. But no one uses it like that anymore, it's always a romantic relationship nowadays


I reserve the right to ignore any weird implications and instead talk about positive and wholesome subjects, even when people are being weird.


in the chinese sub Chongyun describes Shenhe as “Mother’s Younger Sister”, but maybe that’s just a mistake on my part for hearing it wrong or whatever


I missed him a lot today.

But yeah where has the time gone.


I just wish, even if it's naive thinking, that Miura left some notes of how to end Berserk so his assistantes can finish it. At any rate, I will most likely re-read berserk again in the future, his work is way too good after all.


According to my... research, there's about 11k of fate (grand order+ stay/night) and 18k of touhou at least on nhentai.


Lol, 90% of genshintwt is just lesbians


they already had lisa.


~~yatta~~


I hope we're not counting the kids in that ratio...


For a period of time I just gave the fuck up and called everyone 舅 and 姨 to minimise the probability of me getting it wrong.


And it's near that time again, the chinese new year.

Brb gotta consult with my mom.


That's my question about most my relatives, as a russian person


But we gotta act excited anyway for the 红包。


At the end of the Chinese demo the subtitles show “我的小姨？！”.
我的 means "my". 小 lit. "little" indicates Shenhe is younger (by context younger than Chongyun's mother) and 姨 is sister of mother.
Could have also meant that Shenhe is the youngest among her siblings.


Did you miss the dozen characters in the game with aunt/uncle in their name who are not of family relation?

Or even in the last event with eula when the kid called her auntie eula.


same lmfao i burst out laughing and i'd been depressed all day haha


Thank you


Oh shiiii


Ohhhh the “you married a 90 year old widow and your dad married her daughter thing”? Haha classic.. yep.. my family tree looks like a tumbleweed.


Back to the Future What If


Oh I have no idea I just try not to think about it tbh


*\*Inhales\*-*


I mean a shrine could be a kind of funny decoration, bringing a cardboard cutout to thanksgiving on the other hand…


Yeah like Aether learning how to write Liyue (Mandarin?) in a day and writing a essay about Keqing’s tits😂


I don't think anyone was offended... that person was just correcting the commenter.


haha, now I look like an asshole for seemingly demanding a gendered pronoun. Originally, it said "his".

Oh how the turn tables!


I've seen people on twitter get offended with they/them... i dont even know anymore


Well it just proves that everyone is horny


Let me introduce to you the apparently novel concept of a lesbian


"good nsfw artists" it's nasty and awful what are you talking about


>Just copy paste?

Yup.

Huh what about the something something archipelago that Barbara Jean traveler and klee went to, then at the end a bunch of other characters came too


np <3


smh ikr, there's a ship in friendSHIP too. But nope, people tend to believe romances are deeper that friendships lmao


I wish I had that power.


Just like a harem protagonist.


"BuT WhErE ArE ThOsE WhO ShArE ThE MeMoRy?"


Not so naive, Oda has confirmed to have done so with One Piece's ending. It's not out of the picture to assume Miura could've left behind some notes, even if they weren't intended to be instructions.

Still, I'll admit that someone else finishing it probably wouldn't live up to the hype. (not that the people doing it are incompetent, but without strong guidance from its author, manga and anime fall prey to corporate meddling all too easily)


Damn. I stand corrected.


Touhou been around longer though, FGO is relatively recent comparatively. 

Also I feel like Pokémon got everyone beat…


For science, of course


*Says this on a platform ruled mainly by men*


Non Mandarin speaker here, what do those words mean?


Except they could be 叔 and 姑


I forgot my colors but that's red right? I can read that but forget what that is


Act excited? More like act like I don't want it, theres a whole dance of pretending to refuse it but actually I want that shit lmao


Worth it, look at all the Welkins I can buy


I stopped receiving those in my early-20s :(


I don't know what this reads, but I strongly assume it has to do with certain red envelopes


It being part of the name to me felt non-familial. Everyone calls them aunty/uncle that’s why the character name itself has the word.

But when a character calls out someone specific as aunty, my first thought is familial.


Glad me and sis could help


you got some explaining to do 🤨


"Video games"


You'd think Genshin fans would be well-acquainted with them by now, considering.

 Varka isn’t father to either, it’s Simon Pegg. He is currently on Varka’s expedition tho


I thinks it is simply a bit of awkward not full of friction.


The problem isn't that they have trouble properly communicating as sisters, though they DO have that awkwardness.

The problem is their respective social positions (and their parents not getting along I guess). Jean as the Knight's Grandmaster and Barbara as the church's Deaconess. They both have certain standards for appearances that they're expected to maintain. Not to mention they're both extremely busy with their jobs.

During the archipelago event they were both on "vacation" and away from the public eye so they were able too relax to an extent and actually get to spend time with each other more as sisters. Trying to push and encourage this sort of relaxation and bonding was also a big part of why Kaeya, Lisa, etc "helped" such as sending the bathing suits with them. Then again you could also definitely say a lot of that was Alice's doing as well.

Everyone else that ended up on the islands as well already knows about Barbara and Jean being sisters and it's not like they would care in some negative way so it's not a big deal to see them acting that way. Well with the possible exception of Razor but that's really not something he'd care about, plus he might actually already know since he's relatively close with Lisa due to her having taught him how to use his vision.

"Got it memorized?"


Touhou did start 7 years before fate, but I doubt the pc98 era games generated much material. The series hit its stride with EoSD, that was only two years before FSN.

Oddly enough pokemon doesn't have much on nhentai, only about 1k, ehentai has 6k if you only include doujinshi, manga, and western tags, but IIRC they don't include loli/shota content onsite so that'll effect the results.


Uncle and Auntie. Maternal side


that means red packet! chinese new year things


Hm. My family tends to skip the bullshit, it's straight to the 'thank you's and the four-word blessings.


Again in the albedo/eula event, the kid called her out specifically as auntie. A lot of other cultures do it, not just china. That's why the other commenter was pointing out that she was indeed the mothers younger sister. 

Not everyone is an American on the internet.


you're killing me lmao


So your sister loves dad jokes, that's great


Unfortunately, I’ve been sworn to secrecy 😔


I'm sorry you thought women?? don't get horny????


You mean Seamus Pegg. Simon Pegg is the actor.


Normal Albedo: Moment of DEATH


I feel like the Fate franchise really hit peak “popularity” with FGO, given how wide the cast of characters became, whereas with SN it’s just the three girls. I guess my point is that while Touhou has way more overall, I think in the past 5 years FGO is king. 

With Pokémon I think there’s more individual pieces of artwork compared to full doujins. All anecdotal though, and I’d check pixiv for numbers but I’m at work lol


Thank you very much.


Ah thanks I suspected as much but wasn't sure. I need to reassociate my colors


In those instances the context was established. Albedo and Klee aren’t related by blood. Nor are Eula and that kid. But in case of Chongyun and Shenhe, the relationship wasn’t established beforehand. And Chongyun’s surprise to me was a big hint for a familial relationship. I won’t get that surprised to randomly find a neighbour or parent’s friend.

And finally, not sure why you mentioned the last line. I know everyone on the internet is not American. I am not an American myself.

I am getting a feeling that you are a bit angry with my responses. But my responses are purely based on how I perceived things. I could have very well been wrong in perceiving Chongyun and Shenhe’s relationship.


Well I'm not American, but what u/pixelRaid said, was also fairly obvious to me.


Yeah, long term, unless grand order drops in popularity and stops updating, they'll overtake touhou. Even if it's just the couple comics you get from a new character being introduced, fgo makes more characters per year.

Agreed on the pokemon comment the series attracts both the normal degens and the furry ones.


Mind you its maternal side, there're different words used for dad's side and you must never EVER use the words meant for the mom's side for the dad's side, its considered extremely rude and demeaning.


FYI there’s a specific term for your maternal/paternal older uncle/aunt and younger uncle/aunt, and if there’re multiple uncles/aunts there’s a specific word for each of them too. And that goes for their kids (your cousins). And their spouses. Chinese is confusing.


i think their just trying to tell you how they perceived the relationship, in my opinion though, we should just wait for her story quest and see if it involves chongyun, otherwise, do whatever weird shit


Die 6 Ottos von links setzen sich leider durch.


Sind bestimmt alle mit dem Auto zur Demo!1!11!


Links wären bestimmt mehr gekommen wenn "die da oben" nicht alle Parkplätze weg gemacht hätten


Ich liebe Autofahren einfach extrem, bin in meinen 6 Jahren Führerschein 100.000+ km gefahren.

Aber ich verstehe wirklich nicht warum manche Idioten so geil auf Autos in der Stadt sind.


Reaktion auf die Schilder von l.n.r.  
\-Gibt nichts öderes als Straßen und Parkplätze  
\-Warum?  
\-Beachte die Sprache. Es wird von Vernichtung geredet. Welches Bild beschwört das herauf? Und dann setze das in Konrast zu dem was tatsächlich an die Stelle der Parkplätze tritt: lebendige Straßen


Die Forderung nach noch mehr Parkplätzen im urbanen Raum ist für mich kaum noch nachvollziehbar. In meinem Stadtviertel besteht eine mittelgroße Straße aus zwei Doppelspuren und jeweils einem Parkstreifen für Autos links und rechts. Ein relativ schmaler Fußgängerweg quetscht sich auf beiden Seiten außen lang und ab und zu gibt es irgendwo dazwischen noch einen oder zwei Fahrradweg(e).

Gefühlt beanspruchen relativ wenige Autofahrer schon ziemlich viel mehr öffentlichen Raum.
Die Gegenüberstellung versinnbildlicht für mich dieses Ungleichgewicht.


AutoKai legt den Rückwärtsgang für Berlin ein.


Weil Fahrrad einfach Top G unter den Verkehrsmitteln der Stadt ist, vor allem im Norden.


Als ich das letzte Mal ausnahmsweise mit dem Auto statt der Bahn in Berlin war, war ich überrascht wie wenig Parkhäuser vorhanden sind.    
Wieso ist man in Berlin der Meinung, dass es Sinn macht Autos nebeneinander statt übereinander aufzubewahren?

Und dann erstmal alle Parkstreifen zu Radwegen machen.

Ich bin aber auch dafür, dass Parkplätze grundsätzlich kostenpflichtig sein müssten. Niemand hat das Recht öffentliche Flächen kostenlos vollzustellen und damit andere zu behindern.


Ich bin gerade wegen einer Fortbildung in Münster und es ist erstaunlich wie gut das hier mit den Fahrrädern funktioniert. Du bekommst quasi an jeder Ecke eins zur Miete angeboten, es gibt sogar Parkhäuser dafür.

Daheim in der Stadt, musst du um dein Leben bangen wenn du mit dem Fahrrad am Verkehr teilnehmen möchtest, weil keiner Rücksicht auf dich als Radfahrer nimmt.

Man hat mir direkt am ersten Tag geraten, ein Fahrrad zu mieten und "Fahrräder haben immer Vorfahrt".


Ja und wo steht der Ehrenlose berliner Ober Cduhrensohn? Demokratie in Deutschland ist leider oft ein Trauerspiel


Lieber Parkplätze als Radwege, jeder weiß das Radwege das Kryptonit aller Radfahrer sind.


Ich habe keine Ahnung wie erfolgreich welche Demo war, aber man kann von jeder Demo Bilder machen, die sehr erfolgreich oder sehr erfolglos aussehen. Von daher sagen diese Bilder erst mal nichts aus.


Naja, die Einwohner in der Hauptstadt haben sich ganz klar die Union gewünscht. Jetzt sollte man sich nicht wundern, dass Berlin für Radfahrer zerstört wird.


Wie soll man auch zu ner Demo wenn man arbeiten tut und ne Familie hat ? Können ja nicht alles arbeitslose Studenten sein


Die Geringverdiener mit ihren Fahrrädern 🤣 logisch… wenn ich nirgendwo hin müsste, könnte ich auch aufs Auto verzichten 😂

Aber so zu tun, als würde jeder diesen Lifestyle leben mit Hummus im Salat und Jute-Beutel in der Hand ist doch etwas ignorant 😅


Autofahrer haben tatsächlich nen Job


Warum sollte man auch eine Pro-Auto-Demo machen, wenn Autos erlaubt sind? 😅

Oh man das ist hier doch schonwieder ein Vergleich von Äpfel und Birnen.


Links kommen bestimmt noch mehr, stecken wahrscheinlich nur hinter einem Hund aufm Fahrrad fest der meint mit 10kmh zu schleichen.


Ich hoffe die 6 Ottos von links setzen sich durch


wir sind immer noch im land der besten autos, von fahrrädern hör ich wenig wenn ich ehrlich sein soll

Honsi. Dadst ne a song dos die, die für die Wong sein, zünfdig in der Merheit san?  Isses ned so, drink nu a seil.


Leider ist der Bürgermeister auf dem linken Foto. Das sagt ja schon alles


Vernichtung? Lol. Passt auf, bald reden vom Autofahrer Holocaust.


Alles schön und gut aber denkt bitte an die Leute die nicht aus Städten kommen und auf ihr Auto angewiesen sind


Bin damals zu den sechs auf dem Linken Bild runter, das war ganz in der Nähe von meinem Zuhause und wollte mich bisschen mit denen streiten.

Kernaussage: 30 auf der Straße, auf der die standen, ist'ne Frechheit. Dass da keine zwei Minuten von weg eine große Schule ist, zählt nicht, schließlich habe der Kollege in grün ja auch drei Kinder durchgebracht, von denen nie eins überfahren worden wäre. Armes Deutschland /s


Schaut doch mal die vielen neuen Radwege in Berlin an. Selbst im Sommer gähnende Leere.
Sinnlos, davon noch mehr zu bauen. Daher: richtige Entscheidung, mit dem Auto-Hass shlusszumachen


Haben Sie leider :/. Erste Reihe von rechts: Ehemaliger Angeordneter im Bundestag für den Wahlkreis Berlin Schöneberg und daneben der aktuelle Berliner Bürgermeister. Beide CDU und die hat gerade bis auf weiteres alle Radwegprojekte in der Stadt gestoppt.


Der Rest hat es ohne Auto nicht da hin geschafft


Links wären eigentlich mehr , aber der Rest sucht noch einen Parkplatz /s


Tja, ein paar main chars gegen einen haufen NPCs. Was erwartest du?


Wieso leider?


Wenn sich wenige für viele durchsetzen, kennt man irgendwo her.


Deswegen sind da auch nur 6 Leute. Weil sie sich durchsetzen. Würden sie es nicht, dann währen dort Millionen von Menschen.


Immer diese Grüne Doppelmoral !Einself


Bin da bei dir, hab in meinen ersten beiden Jahren jeweils weit über 30.000km gemacht, mache im Job aktuell auch nichts anderes.

Aber warum Leute privat in Berlin alles mit dem Auto machen wollen, bleibt mir ein Rätsel. Berlin ist da sogar noch fast ein Positivbeispiel, ich glaub wir haben ne Autofahrerquote von ca 50%.

Besonders in reichen Städten wie Hamburg, München, Stuttgart fahren aber deutlich mehr Leute Auto und ich checks nicht. Es macht dem Fahrer keinen Spaß, es macht dem Auto keinen Spaß, es macht den anderen Leuten drumherum keinen Spaß. 

Wenn ich in der Stadt wohnen würde, würde ich auch weniger rumfahren, aber ich hätte ein Interesse an Anwohnerparkplätzen, weil man ohne Auto außerhalb der Berlins halt echt aufgeschmissen ist.

Ich komm leider (oder zum Glück lol?) von außerhalb, bin also wohl oder übel auch aufs Kfz angewiesen.


hört hört


Wenn die Kleber Hinter dir sind …


[deleted]


Und guck‘ dir nach Münster nochmal Amsterdam an. Das ist erst richtiges next level von dem jede Deutsche Stadt leider noch so meilenweit entfernt ist (und jetzt sogar wieder riesen Schritte rückwärts macht)


Ich würde es sehr zu schätzen wissen wenn du mal nen Bild posten könntest, das eine Pro-Auto-Demo zeigt, die gut besucht wurde bzw. "gut fotografiert" wurde. Eins reicht schon.


"Ganz klar die Union gewünscht" würde ich nicht sagen, die vorherige RRG Regierung hätte auch nach der Wahl ja weiter regieren können. Giffey hatte aber Angst vor einer Bild-Kampagne gegen ihre Person und ist deshalb mit der CDU zusammen gegangen.


Weil die ganzen glatzköpfigen Achims und die ganzen Boomer-Anetten auf dem rechten Bild, die sich unter die Millennials und Gen Z gedrängt haben, selbstverständlich allesamt arbeitslose Studenten sind; ich glaube es auch. Zumal Studenten nicht arbeitslos sind, denn sie sind eben genau das, nämlich Studenten. Wenn die eigenen Gehirnzellen zu keinerlei gedanklicher Leistung in der Lage sind, sollte man öffentliches Posten besser unterlassen.


die stecken wohl eher hinter der stoßstange des autos vor ihnen. das ist das wesentlich realistischere szenario.


Es geht hier um eine Straße in Berlin, wo alle Jahre wieder Radfahrer umgefahren werden, weil es für diese zentrale Verbindungsstrecke keinen Radweg gibt.


>noch im land der besten autos

Du hast leider die Propaganda geschluckt.

>These are the Most Reliable Car Brands by 2022  
>  
>1.Toyota 2.Lexus 3.Kia 4.Honda 5.Buick 6.Mazda 7.Hyundai 8.Genesis 9.Acura **10.BMW**

Ich schau garnicht erst nach "most cars sold" das würde noch schlimmer aussehen.


Wir bauen ehrlich gesagt richtig gute Fahrräder innkeeper Disziplin


Made in Germany ist halt nicht gerade billig, aber entsprechend hochwertiges Zeug bekommst Du im Fahrradmarkt dafür. Rohloff, Pinion, Schmidt, Alber, Bosch (gut, dort kommt alles aus China), Supernova, Lupine, Busch & Müller, Ergon, Hebie… Und das sind nur die Komponentenhersteller.


…noch, BYD + Tesla haben in China schon übernommen!


Ja dann zeig doch mal nen Bild von ner Pro-Auto-Demo in Berlin bei der mehr als diese paar Hanseln rumeiern. Gerne auch in einer VoRtEiLhAfTen PeRsPekTiVe. 

Und diesen Ablenkungs-Murx mit Daytona500 kannste dir och klemmen. Das hat NULL Komma NIX mit dem Thema zu tun.


keine ahnung warum du so gedownvotet wirst. es ist komplett korrekt was du sagst. der futzi im anzug sieht so aus als würde er pressewirksam ein gespräch halten... also ein foto dafür machen. ob er sich da drei andere peinliche typen rausgezogen hat oder das, so hoffe ich, die einzigen dödel da waren, wissen wir nur anhand dieses bildes nicht. 

das gleiche gilt für das linke foto. wobei hier die negative argumentation etwas schwierig wird... zumindest wenn man von den zahlreichen leuten ohne helm absieht.

>bis auf weiteres alle Radwegprojekte in der Stadt gestoppt.

Ja, [aber](https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2023/06/berlin-senat-neuer-radweg-schoenhauserallee.htm/listallcomments=on.html) ...


Können wir eigtl klagen o.ä., weiß das jmd? Ich hab irgendwo gelesen, dass das nicht mit rechten Dingen zugeht? Also nicht nur moralisch sondern auch rechtlich


Und wie wir wissen sind daran ja schließlich die GRünEn Schuld und nicht die immer wachsende Zahl und Größe von Autos, die im städtischen Raum eine solide Hälfte aller Spuren zustellen und selbst fahrend nicht im Ansatz leistungsfähig genug sind, um die Mobilitätsbedürfnisse einer Mehrheit der Berliner abzudecken.


Weil fehlende Radinfrastruktur das Leben für alle schlechter macht.


Es gibt aber bei weitem nicht genug Anwohnendeparkplätze in den Städten. Dort ist sowieso schon jede Straße zugemüllt mit Autos. Und ja, ich muss es so bezeichnen, weil so eine riesige Fläche der Stadt nur dem Auto gehören und jedes Stadtbild zeichnen, obwohl der größte Teil davon selten bis nie bewegt wird. 

Die wenigsten brauchen ernsthaft ein Auto, aber fast alle haben eins. Da müsste man ansetzen, aber genau davor hat die Autolobby eben auch Angst.


Ich hab selber in München gewohnt und ich hab das Auto ganz einfach ein bisschen weiter draußen (auch nur 10 min U-Bahn) hingestellt und bin halt dann mit der U-Bahn reingefahren.

Aber mir wäre auch im Traum nicht eingefallen dass ich das Auto innerhalb Münchens verwende…


Niemand nimmt dir dein auto weg Ulf


Tatsächlich würde ich das auch nicht gerne machen wollen, aber wenns dort ne Dusche gibt, warum nicht! Das beste Herz ist ein gesundes Herz. 

Mein Großonkel hat einen Arbeitskollegen, der Fährt tatsächlich circa 40 Kilometer mitm Rad in eine Richtung. Zugegeben, er ist halbprofessioneller Rennradfahrer, hat auch ein teures Rennrad über die Firma gepachtet und fährt damit seine 80 km den Tag.


Ich würde es sehr zu schätzen wissen, wenn du genau lesen würdest, was ich geschrieben habe. Dann würdest du erkennen, dass ich von Demos generell geschrieben habe, ohne jeglichen Bezug zu diesen Bildern oder dem Thema generell.


100% Die SPD ist schuld. Jeder wusste, was man von der CDU erwarten kann und trotzdem hat sich die SPD für eine GroKo in Berlin entschieden.


Du sagst es doch schon selber. Sind alles Rentner welche ja oft sowieso nicht mehr Autofahren können... der größte und wichtigste Teil der Gesellschaft und der Arbeitenden Bevölkerung, die "normalen Leute" sind nicht vertreten. Nur die Leute wechlche es sowieso nicht betrifft, welche die meist nicht mal nen Auto haben. Arbeitslos meint das eine Person nicht Arbeiten tut, was auf Studenten auch zutrifft. Und bei den Meisten Studiengängen die diese Leute wählen auch so bleiben wird (Kunst, sozialwissenschaftliche Fächer, Gender studies etc. Auch BWL obwohl das dort wahrscheinlich keiner studieren wird.) Meine Aussage stimmt also und jetzt fang bitte nicht an zu heulen


Kann gut sein. Wahrscheinlich weil das Auto 100 Autos voraus hinter einem Fahrradfahrer steckt der mit 10kmh radelt obwohl rechts aufm Bordstein ein Fahrradweg ist.


Ich weiß nicht wie es in Berlin ist aber viele Radfahrer fahren auch eher aggressiv als degressiv und legen es manchmal voll drauf an sich mit Autos anzulegen 😅 lieber einmal mehr bremsen und leben behalten, als auf sein Recht zu bestehen. 
Will damit nicht sagen, dass die Radfahrer Schuld sind, bei Gott nicht, es gibt so viele beschissene Autofahrer, denen der Führerschein entzogen gehört aber ich glaube es wäre ganz gut wenn man auch ein Führerschein fürs Fahrrad machen würde wenn man die Straßen mit benutzt


propaganda? also wenn du plastik ausstattung so toll findest dann weiß ich auch nicht so recht aber irgendwie gibts keinen erfolgreichen menschen der nen kia fährt 😂💀

Das sind CDU-Futzies. Einer davon der Berliner Bürgermeister.


Immerhin ein Lichtblick.


Auch ist das ein klarer Schritt gegen die Verkehrswende und das ist doch indirekt ein Verstoß gegen den Klimavertrag, den Deutschland unterschrieben hat? Also jetzt mal ganz ohne Rechtskenntnisse


Die Deutsche Umwelthilfe ist da wohl dran: https://www.duh.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilung/deutsche-umwelthilfe-erstes-verfahren-gegen-radwegestopp-in-berlin-jetzt-vor-gericht/


Was das mit dem Zumüllen angeht ist es natürlich Ansichtssache, aber was das Stadtbild vieler Großstädte außerhalb der Touristikgegenden angeht, stimme ich da grundsätzlich zu. Hängt damit zusammen, dass die Person, die ihr Auto nur einmal alle 4 Monate benutzt, dieses halt auch nicht pflegt und alles entsprechend schäbig aussieht.

Vielen Leuten müsste man halt mal klar machen, dass, wenn man einmal im Monat nur fährt, ein Miles o.Ä. deutlich preiswerter ist, als ein eigenes Auto. 

Was die Anwohnerparkplätze angeht: Alles, was so im öffentlichen Raum ist, nur für die Anwohner und den Rest so Parkhäuser und Tiefgaragen bauen und sowas dann mit Gebühren machen. Ganz einfach.


Würde ich auch machen, funktioniert bei mir leider nicht. Mal abgesehen davon pendele ich auch nicht in die Innenstadt sondern nach Treptow-Köpenick, also eher Außenbezirk.


Also hast du kein Bild für mich?


Du brauchst mir meine Worte nicht im Munde zu verdrehen und wirklich Ahnung von der Thematik hast du auch nicht. Denn erstens hängen auch Rentner oftmals unnötigerweise an ihren Karren, obwohl sie Anspruch auf unterschiedliche Angebote bezüglich ÖPNV hätten, gäben sie erst einmal ihren Führerschein ab. Und es sind sehr wohl junge und mittelalte Menschen bei eben diesen Demos vertreten. Das liegt unter anderem daran, dass Autos eigentlich nichts in Innenstädten, vor allem nicht in Großstädten verloren haben. Sie verpesten die Luft, sie nerven mit ihren lauten Geräuschen, sie machen alles hässlich und unansehnlich, nehmen unfassbar viel Platz weg und sind absolut nicht notwendig, um innerhalb einer Stadt von A nach B zu kommen. Dazu stehen sie eh die meiste Zeit rum und machen das Leben in der Stadt weniger lebenswert, und ja, dazu gibt es Studien, das ist keine bloße subjektive Meinung. Es gibt unzählige Studien, die eindeutig zu dem Schluss kommen, dass der ÖPNV in großen Städten schneller und besser ist. Günstiger sowieso und über die umwelttechnischen Aspekte brauchen wir nicht diskutieren. Und jetzt brauchst du auch nicht Schnappatmung bekommen und mit "aber auf dem Land" kommen, denn davon hat es keiner. Du bist in Berlin, Hamburg, München, dem Ruhrpott und anderen Großstädten mit Bus, U-Bahn, S-Bahn und Tram schneller an nahezu jedem Ort als mit dem Auto und man spart sich größtenteils die Nutzung unendlich breiter Straßen und Beton- oder Teehöllen, die man Parkplatz nennt. Und ja, all das trifft auch auf die arbeitende Bevölkerung zu. Denn ein großer Teil der arbeitenden Bevölkerung kommt so nämlich auf die Arbeit, mit Bus, Bahn und Co. Und das berufsunabhängig. Und Rentner als einen nicht wichtigen Teil der Gesellschaft zu betrachten zeigt von einem miesen Charakter. Ganz davon zu schweigen, was denn der sogenannte "normale" Bürger überhaupt sein soll, den du anführst. Und nein, Studenten sind weder vor dem Gesetz noch sonst in irgendeiner Weise arbeitslos. Studenten arbeiten, vor allem je nach Studiengang, härter als manche, die "hart" arbeiten. Du hast deinen Aussagen zufolge entweder nie studiert oder einfach eine absolute wirre Wahrnehmung. Aber hey, deine Aussage stimmt ja und immerhin bist du ja deine Quelle dafür, also muss das wohl stimmen. Oder? Oder?


Wenn man etwas nur oft genug behaupten „tut“, hat man natürlich automatisch Recht 🤦🏻‍♂️


Eher weil die ampel rot ist. Wenn dich verkehr nervt, nimm auch Fahrrad


Da die meisten Todesopfer von Rechtsabbiegern umgebracht werden und die Radfahrer Vorfahrt haben ist das ein schwieriges Thema.

Du kannst praktisch nicht an jeder Kreuzung, bei der Du Grün hast, stoppen und nach links gucken, ob dich gerade ein LKW sieht oder nicht.

Aber ansonsten gebe ich dir aus eigener Erfahrung recht.  
Es gibt mehr Fahrradfahrer die gegen die STVO verstoßen als Autofahrer in Berlin. Leider gibt es fürs Fahrrad keine Führerscheinpflicht. Das merkt man.


Das Gegenteil von aggressiv ist Defensiv. Degressiv bedeutet abnehmend, verringern usw.


Dir ist schon bewusst, dass ersten die meisten Leute, die Fahrrad fahren auch Auto fahren - ergo auch einen Führerschein haben. Und zweitens in Berlin in der 4. Klasse (oder 3.?) man in die Verkehrsschule geht, da alle wichtigen Regeln lernt und seinen Fahrradführerschein macht?   


Offensichtlich nicht, sonst würdest du nicht so einen Murks von dir geben.  


Und btw, aggressiv fahren, ist meiner Meinung nach sicherer, als langsam eng am Straßenrand (was leider viele unsichere Radfahrer machen) - alleine schon wegen der Dooringzone.


> irgendwie gibts keinen erfolgreichen menschen der nen kia fährt

Lol. Nochmal bestätigt das Klischee.

Erfolgreiche Menschen fahren in der Regel kein eigenes Auto.
Firmenwagen sind meist staatlich subventioniert, inländische Marken zu verwenden.


Klar, erfolgreiche Menschen müssen ne "tolle" Karre haben, sonst sieht ja keiner dass sie erfolgreich sind und es weiß ja auch jeder, dass das wichtigste auf der Welt die Schnösel sind, die mit unnötigen Statussymbolen protzen müssen. was soll man auch anderes machen, wenn der Rest des Lebens keinen tiefgreifenden Sinn hergibt.

🙈


> Schätzungsweise hat sicher ein guter Teil der Edelbikefahrer den passenden SUV mit Fahrradträger

Vielleicht aber nutzt du auch einfach eine vollkommen aus der Luft gegriffene Behauptung, um die Demoteilnehmer:innen zu diskreditieren


Du = viel text, nix bild.


Dann tritt doch einfach den Beweis an, dass deine Aussge auf diesen Fall Anwendung findet. So wie Menschen mit hohem Bildungsniveau das halt machen.


Leider


Okay, gut. Das nervt mich nämlich schon mächtig wie sich da wieder verhalten wird


Deshalb spende ich auch an die DUH. Da gibt es eine Klagenpatenschaft mit der man nur dafür spendet.


Nein habe ich nicht, weil ich weder jemals auf so einer Demo war, noch für dich jetzt irgendwas recherchiere. Ich bin btw auch nicht "für Autos", weiss daher nicht was man auf einer pro-Auto-Demo möchte. 
Hat mit meiner Grundaussage aber auch nichts zu tun, aber das raffst du scheinbar nicht. 
Hoffe, die Radler haben in Berlin Erfolg. Ist vielleicht auch sinnvoller, die "fahrende Bevölkerung" auf 2 und 4 Rädern einzubinden, anstatt von oben herab was zu entscheiden. Aber damit tut sich die Politik leider auch überall schwer.


Tatsächlich stört mich am Verkehr meistens nur die Fahrradfahrer.


Das ist ja das was ich meine. Wenn ich auf dem Fahrrad unterwegs bin, rechne ich eher mit dem Fehler der anderen um mein Leben zu schützen und bremse lieber ab und gucke ob der Rechtsabbieger mich auch gesehen hat anstatt einfach zu sagen ich habe Vorfahrt ich fahre einfach gerade aus. Ich bremse lieber einmal zu viel als einmal zu wenig 😅

Bei vielen liegt es an zu wenig mitdenken oder kein Schulterblick oder zu wenig Einsichtigkeit der Wege im Fahrzeug. Ich glaube halt nicht, dass sich irgendein LKW- oder PKWfahrer denkt: "Da kommt ein scheiß Radfahrer den nehme ich jetzt die Vorfahrt und niete den um". Vielleicht gibt es wirklich ein paar asoziale Schweine die so denken oder das machen aber da hoffe ich auf ein paar einzelne Spackos (am besten natürlich keiner).


Es darf natürlich keine Rechtfertigung sein, aber Menschen sind nunmal oft fehlbar: Liegt es eventuell daran, dass man sich auf dem Rad immer als schwächerer Verkehrsteilnehmer fühlt, der ständig von gefährlichen Autofahrenden bedroht wird? Klar sollte dann eigentlich die Konsequenz sein, noch defensiver zu fahren. Aber mir selbst gelingt das auch manchmal nicht, wenn ich ständig Steine in den Weg gelegt bekomme (Radweg endet im Nirgendwo, nie grüne Welle für Radverkehr, potentiell höhere Gefährlichkeit von Autos ggü Radfahrenden als andersrum etc.), so dass ich denke, ich dürfte mir mehr Rechte rausnehmen - auch da ich mich sozial verträglicher Verhalte als der Autoverkehr (weniger, bis gar nicht tödlich, kein Lärm, keine Abgase, geringerer Flächenverbrauch…)? 
Das nur als Erklärungsversuch.
Es gibt allerdings eine Studie die belegt, dass alle Verkehrsmittel gleich stark die Regeln brechen (nur mal so)


Also erstmal brauchst du hier nicht so aggressiv schreiben und wenn man keine Ahnung hat sollte man einfach mal die Klappe halten nicht wahr? Dann würdest du nicht so ein Murks von dir geben.

In Deutschland haben etwas weniger als 20 Millionen Menschen den Autoführerschein und etwas weniger als 60 Millionen Menschen in Deutschland haben ein Fahrrad und nutzen dieses laut dem Statistischem Bundesamt. 

Wenn du einfach ein bißchen vorher googlen würdest bevor du so einen Murks von dir gibst ersparst du dir einiges an Peinlichkeit 😉

So wie du schreibst solltest du bitte dein Fahrrad sowie deinen Führerschein abgeben oder ihn vielleicht nochmal neu machen und aufpassen. Dann würdest auch mitbekommen, dass man defensiv fahren soll und nicht aggressiv. Vielleicht solltest du auch mit der 3. / 4. Klasse wieder anfangen, bevor du dich an den Führerschein wagst. 👌


welches klischee? das asiatische autos, allen voran kia ein auto für weniger verdienende ist? Und wenn erfolgreiche nicht selber fahren, lassen sie sich in was chauffieren - in nem Kia Sportage oder Ner S-Klasse? bleib du mal auf deinem Fahrradsattel statt so nen schwachsinn abzugeben, ist ja hanebüchen was hier für "experten" unterwegs sind

Ich hab nur gefragt weil du der dritte warst, der diesen Punkt machen wollte im Sinne von "man muss das nur so oder so fotografieren und schon sieht das ganz anders aus". Alle hab ich nach einem (!) Bild gefragt, das ihre Aussage supporten könnte. Keiner hat eins gepostet. Ich lass das mal so stehen. Peace.


Diese Bösen Radfahrer nehmen den armen Autos den Platz weg!!!!!


Aber mit genau dieser Haltung bzw. Forderung an die schwächeren Verkehrsteilnehmer wird man nie zu einer echten Verkehrswende kommen. Ich weiß, dass du gute Intentionen mit deinem Argument hast und individuell gesehen ist das ja auch völlig richtig. Nur wenn wir immer verlangen, dass die schwächeren Verkehrsteilnehmer, die sich aber sozial- und umweltverträglicher verhalten, zurückstecken und sich an den Rand verpissen müssen, gewinnen wir am Ende nichts. In der endgültigen Konsequenz würde mit der Forderung nach ständiger defensiver Zurückhaltung immer das Recht des Stärkeren gelten.
ME muss eine absolut sichere Infrastruktur her und die starken und für andere gefährlichen  Verkehrsteilnehmer müssen absolut in die Pflicht genommen werden - auch für das Fehlverhalten der Schwächeren. Das mag radikal klingen, allerdings gibt es dieses Prinzip auch schon in der Gefährdungshaftung.


> Es gibt allerdings eine Studie die belegt, dass alle Verkehrsmittel gleich stark die Regeln brechen (nur mal so)

Ja klar. Ein Auto dass bei Rot fährt, und regelmäßig von der Fahrbahn auf den Bürgersteig wechselt. Und bei Grün für Autofahrer sowie bei Grün für Fußgänger fährt. Das sieht man ja täglich.


Lol "wenn man keine Ahnung hat" sollte man die Fakten vielleicht vernünftig recherchieren. 

Es gibt 21 Millionen PKW (!) Scheckkartenführerscheine. Außerdem gibt es 18 Millionen Motorradführerscheine und 24 Millionen LKW Führerscheine. Da es natürlich Doppelungen gibt, sind die insgesamten Zahlen von Inhabern eines Scheckkartenführerscheins nochmal höher. Wenn man jetzt bedenkt dass ca. 15 Millionen Papierführerscheine und 28 Millionen Scheckkartenführerscheine umgetauscht werden müssen (das aber nur die Führerscheine bis 2013 beinhaltet), siehst du hoffentlich worauf ich hinaus will? 

Deine 20 Millionen sind eh schon falsch, und dann hast du nicht Mal die komplette [Quelle](https://de.statista.com/themen/1351/fuehrerscheine/#topicOverview) gelesen offensichtlich. 

[Hier](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/4972/umfrage/entwicklung-des-bestandes-an-fahrerlaubnissen-nach-fahrerlaubnisklassen/) habe ich noch eine andere Statistik gefunden, die auch "andere" Fahrerlaubnisse (wahrscheinlich Mofa etc.) Hinzuzählt. Da steht für 2023 48 Millionen. Immer noch ohne die 15 Millionen Papierführerscheine! 

Sind wir also insgesamt bei knapp 60 Millionen. 

16,9% von 84,3 Millionen Einwohnern sind unter 18. Das sind ca. 13,74 Millionen. [destatis Quelle ](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Bevoelkerungsstand/Tabellen/bevoelkerung-altersgruppen-deutschland.html)

Wenn wir jetzt einfach Mal plump davon ausgehen, dass sich das gleichmäßig über die 18 Jahre erstreckt, kann man ja einfach Mal die 16 und 17 jährigen abziehen (auch wenn da definitiv nicht alle/viele einen Führerschein besitzen. Dann sind wir immernoch bei 12,2 Millionen. 

Wenn wir das jetzt alles zusammenzählen haben (12,2+60=~72) ungefähr 72 Millionen Leute einen Führerschein oder können noch gar keinen haben. Von insgesamt 84,3 Millionen Einwohnern sind das über 85%. Also ja, dass die meisten Leute tatsächlich einen Führerschein haben ist keine Bullshitaussage. 

Und 60 Millionen fahren Fahrrad? Mensch, ob es da ne Überschneidung gibt? Ich weiß es nicht. Scheint mir sehr sehr unwahrscheinlich /s.


Hm, fang mal bei dir an.


Ja, das machen Radfahrende. Autofahrende spielen am Handy, halten sich nicht an die Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzungen und Sicherheitsabstände und wh gibt es noch viele viele weitere Beispiele für Verstöße auf beiden Seiten…und jetzt?


It won me over and I am buying it.  I didn't really have any interest in it before I tried the demo.  Well done.


It still blows my mind that demos aren't a more common thing. I would really like to be enlightened on this because i'm not a marketing expert.


Yeah, I agree. This demo was an absolute gem and from the looks of it, this is going to be a wild ride of a game


Day one purchase from me, phenomenal demo


It's incredible. This game kinda fell off for me the closer it got to launch date but after playing the demo I am hyped. Can't wait.


Wanted to buy Diablo 4, but after playing FFXVI demo I think Diablo can wait.


It was an excellent demo, they have really got their shit together this time


Including the first few hours that carries over to the full game  was such a good idea. 

I assumed the demo was just going to be the combat demo you unlocked after, which although good, wouldn't have hooked people in the same way as the interesting story.


Good writing speaks for itself.

I feel like gamers like to go on and on about what makes writing good or not, but in this case, the prologue of the game was actually compelling enough for me to want to see the rest of the story and avoided a lot of common pitfalls with fantasy.

- I did not need to understand all the geopolitical stuff and names of everything to understand the drama of what was happening

- The characters immediately gave me a reason to like them and sympathize with them

- A major conflict was established right away

- An inciting incident happens before the first major gameplay section

Like, this is what good writing looks like. By the end of this prologue I had a clear idea of who the hero was, who the villain was, what the conflict was, and what was at stake, and I cared about all those things.

It’s actually not easy; most games - even most Final Fantasy games - often faceplant at these basic storytelling fundamentals, but these guys made it look easy.


Demo scale of reference:

Is your demo more of a forspoken or a FFXIV?


fine i’ll download the demo


It's easy to market, when the game is actually good. Just play the demo lol, said capcom


Hopefully other games will follow suit and actually start with an interesting opening so they can capitalise on a demo too. How many other games could have done this to the same effect? Last of Us? That’s literally all I can think of.


The first 30 minutes of the demo were so good I deleted it because I just want to enjoy the full game from the start next week


My wife, (not a gamer), asked me if I wanted the game for Father’s Day. I have zero time for a game like FF, so I told her no thank you. She then said, “There is a demo. Try it out and see if you like it.” After looking at her sideways like ‘Who are you and what did you do with my wife,’ I downloaded it. 

I’m not a fan of RPG’s. Old school games about as new as Lunar for PS1 is as far as i made it. I’ve tried, but they just never caught my attention.

This demo ….. THIS DEMO!!!! I get to play games now and then, 15 - 30 minutes a pop is what I have time to do. I played the entire thing in one sitting.  I texted my brother halfway in to playing the demo and told him to immediately download this game. He told me he was up until 5:30 AM playing it for the third time. 

I was raving about it yesterday to my wife, who it turns out already preordered it for me.


I haven't been this invested in a Final Fantasy protagonist the way Clive Rosfield just hooked me from the get go. This might have been the most fun I've had controlling a JRPG player character in quite a bit. The worldbuilding and how the demo handled implicit storytelling was also fantastic and the characters were very well written for the politically murky and often ethically corrupt backdrop of this point in the story, especially Benedikta Harman and her status as having significant leverage as an intelligencer for a powerful military nation


First demo in my life that made me “buy now” right after I was done.


I have never played a Final Fantasy game before but this one really intrigues me….do I need to have played the other fifteen games for it all to make sense?

Edit: thanks to everyone for your responses, I will definitely be checking out the demo when I have the chance!


They sold me on the game at "You cock" ~Benedikta


Best friend of mine was convinced he wasn’t gonna buy it and wait for sale. Got a message a little while after the demo came out and he told me he pre ordered 😂 it’s doing it’s job.


Day 1


I didn’t even finish it. And led me to preorder it. It just blew my mind instantly.


More games need to do this.


I just can’t get over how my expectations were sky high and this demo still absolutely obliterated all my expectations. 

Friday can’t come soon enough, if they keep this up it very well could be neck and neck for my favourite final fantasy game. Unbelievable.

It’s like they’ve combined my love of final fantasy with my love of grim dark fantasy books. The music, the gameplay, the story. It didn’t need to go this hard but it did.


I remember the FF8 demo in a similar vein


Which is hilarious since the last demo they had was Forspoken and it legit made me not want to get it, the difference between Square’s A team and B team is crazy lol


Played it last night. Literally left my jaw dropped.


This game is gonna be amazing I can feel it, the combat, the story, the sound! Feels like a goty contender so far.


Good article. I’m reminded that the opening to FFXV had me pushing a broken down car along the highway and how i almost instantly became less interested in the game (despite eventually coming back to finish it a year later).


My wife watched me play it a few nights ago. After it ended she asked me if I had it on preorder and I said “nah, but I’ll pick it up when it comes out.” And she basically just shamed me into preordering the digital copy right there on the screen.


Completely won me over, I wasn't really interested before. Hope more AAA games learn some lessons from this!


I had zero interest in playing this game or the demo but you've all convinced me otherwise


It's so damn good!


Good. All I have to do is get a PS5 and a copy of the game. I think I have a solid plan.


The big 'W' for Square Enix and the team here is that the game is actually good. It's not just that there's a demo, it's that there's a demo for a high-quality game—a game of maybe the highest quality ever. There's a big difference here.


Remember when games in the 90s and early 00s did this?


Total opposite of what happened with Forspoken lol.


"Demos are good"

We knew this 30 years ago.

FF XVI demo was great though.


Never played any Final fantasy, or japanese games by the way, but i live rpgs, will i like the game or jumping on 16s makes no sense??


I love how the general consensus in the industry was to avoid demos and to focus on trailers, and Yoshida strides in and says "ah, but what if we make the demo ***good"***


Demo left me wanting more.


Had no interest in this game. 

However I played through the demo, and I couldn't believe how long it was, and then I was hooked. 

Day 1 purchase for me now


GOT + AOT + FFIX

Awesome demo, very impressed


I was screaming I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS when it was over

And even the second part of the demo was so fun, it sold me once on the story and then again on the gameplay

Square has been doing great demos lately, and almost all of them have some carry-over functionality, which is awesome


It is so hard to describe just how uninterested, skeptical or outright opposed much of the discussion around FF16 has been for the past year. Just a week ago, you couldn't find anyone outside of a very small group of people who were very interested in the game.

The moment that demo dropped, there was a sea change that washed over the gaming community like I've never seen before. People who had barely noticed FF16 or Final Fantasy suddenly started chatting up about how excited they were for the game after playing the demo. It's been incredible just how positive the demo's reception has been.

Edit: I know everyone's experience with the game over the past year is different. I purposefully went and looked at what people were or weren't saying about the game in various areas of the wider gaming community. Among FF fans, among JRPG fans, among RPG, Action, PS/Xbox/Nintendo/PC fans, etc. I wanted a general idea of what kind of attention it was getting. And even among FF14 fans, the community you'd think it would be best received, people were miffed it at it cause it wasn't coming to PC day one. 

But I suppose the best example of the kind of interest I saw FF16 getting before the demo dropped is at the State of Play in April. I didn't hear a lot of hype for FF16 outside of the people who already knew about CBU3's work on FFXIV. I just heard, "Where the hell is Spider-Man 2?" And that was coming from the install base FF16 would be selling to.


Was going to buy it before, after playing the demo I'm still going to buy it.


Day one. That demo was great.


Having played the demo and then immediately pre-ordered the game, I hope this encourages more studios to release demos. 

It's a travesty we don't get demos anymore, back in the day with demo discs I bought so many games I would never have considered but for playing the demo of it


The demo sold me! Really liking the DmC feel in the combat.


The demo was awesome, I pre-ordered it the moment I finished it.

Also, being able to save my progress at the end of the demo so I don't have to replay it? Masterclass for sure.


The running annimations are too floaty for me. Not sure why they're so different than the ones from FFVII remake.


Dude it’s awesome and I had no idea it was rated M. It’s game of thrones meets lord of the rings meets final fantasy.


I feel weird because I liked the story but the combat was pretty boring to me, so the demo kinda put me off


I think im the odd one out here, but it actually watered down a lot of my enthusiasm for the game.

I couldn't stand the constant interruptions of 'move 20 paces, have a cutscene' again and again. Killed the flow for me.

The movement looks weird, like im sliding or chained to something. Same effect when you start lagging in a game.

The combat tutorial was laborious.

Cool cutscene kill noments get interrupted by your xp screen.

That being said, the combat was very enjoyable and felt rewarding especially against the knight boss. 

And the story had its hooks in me by the end!

Not a day 1, but on the list for me.


Did anyone else notice the bad frame rate on PS5? 

Also the screen flickering / tearing during menu start up and other moments in the demo. 

The story was great and I’m excited but all I’m seeing is people acting like this is game of the decade and I didn’t get that vibe at all, ff15 has better graphics I literally compared it to the demo on my ps5. I booted up the demo then I booted up FF15 and IMO ff15 has better graphics.


I was going to wait for a sale or something, but the demo got me to preorder.

Other companies should take note.  This awesome demo probably doubled thier preorders.  I personally know 6 people who have pre ordered now because of how good it was.


I just wish the in game cutscenes ran at a smooth 60 instead of 30fps


First FF game. Can’t wait for its release


I found it to be ok, but it didn't quite reach the level of very good for me. am I alone in feeling this way?


Can't turn off motion blur is my main issue. And combat was underwhelming after playing SoP


I'm not done with it yet, but so far my only complaint is not enough fighting


I would agree if the performance was stable


This whole comments section stinks of astroturfing.

Just wait for the reviews


I feel like I'm in crazytown reading this press because the demo did nothing for me. The story, world and characters were dull as dishwater (which the porridge-gray visual design isn't helping) and the combat was in the vein of DMC and Bayonetta, two franchises which I never liked (spectacle hack n' slashes are fine for those who like them, just not my cup of tea). And yeah, I miss turn -based combat in AAA titles.


Honestly, people are way overhyping this. Classic case of style way over substance tbh.


I know I'm in the minority, but the demo actually put me off from the game.

The last 2 games I have played are elden ring and sekiro. The combat and level designs on those games were so good that I couldn't appreciate FF16.

I will get this game one day most likely. But probably be a while.


I'm still on the fence. Too many QTE's, lengthy on-rails shooter sections, motion blur I can't turn off making me nauseous.., not a fan of game of thrones-style storytelling either. 

It's a good thing there was a combat demo after, I really liked that segment.


Brilliant demo and I’ll absolutely buy the game now but not until they work on that performance mode. 

Stating they’re not going to release a day one patch seems really weird now.


I'm in the minority again. I didn't enjoy it at all. Canceled my pre-order actually. The combat was a button mash fest and all the cutscenes were putting me to 😴😴


Playing the demo right now and it looks stunning. Gotta be honest i did kinda hate that very initital thing when the two things are flying around and you are literally just holding triangle to shoot, that was horrendous, i hope there isnt any more of that throughout the game haha


After learning the game is approx 100 gb, i was going to get the disc version but now, should I save some trouble and just go digital?


Loved it. But did anyone find the character movement to be stiff and kind of archaic? It felt very not next gen while everything else did.


[deleted]


It's delightful but made me second guess buying it, it was about 70% cut scenes, and I get it's a FF game, buttttttttt, I want to play it, not watch it.


And i have a friend who refuses to play it because I said it’ll beat SF6 and possibly Zelda for GOTY based on that demo Lol. His loss.


I swear you can just spam triangle and that keeps the enemies at bay?


IDK, they’ve done so much advertising I’m tired of hearing about this game. 

There now seems little to be surprised about when the game actually launches. The unknown is much more exciting. They had me excited with the initial looks at the game over a year ago. Now, that excitement is just a meh. I feel like I’ve seen it all.


I played 15 mins of it and was *so* convinced by it I immediately stopped because I didn’t want to spoil myself any more. 

I was not planning on buying this game, now I will most definitely buy it on day One.


Yup they nailed this. What a good demo.


Damn, I don’t even have a PS5 and I want to buy it from everything I hear


Allowing my progress to transfer = chef’s kiss


My girlfriend watched me play the demo. She’s never played FF in her life was but was hooked from the graphics and story. She implored me to get it day one. I don’t usually get that kind of glowing approval from her for these things.


Only thing I wish for is to be able to edit UI size. It's nice for subtitles, but UI is a little small for me.


Look I’m not one to shout “conspiracy!” At everything but like the dramatic shift in this games public perception all of a sudden is really really odd. Not that it was bad before the demo but like suddenly everyone seems to be claiming this game as game of the generation off one demo…it’s very odd


Can we stop using the word masterclass please? It's become a buzzword and lost all meaning. Let's expand our vocabularies.


Overall, I enjoyed it, but I'll levy some criticisms.

Namely, I didn't feel as immersed as I did in previous entries.

FFXV was hailed as "the most realistic-looking game" in 2016, a graphical marvel with an incredible art direction that still holds up seven years later. I understand that FFXV is viewed unfavourably by many, but as the immediate preceding mainline title, it should also be considered as the baseline for FFXVI to improve upon in every aspect.

While FFXVI looks amazing in its own right, I can't helped but feel a little disappointed given the period of time and the PS5 benchmark. A lot of models look low-poly, textures are very flat, the lighting looks artificial, the shadows seem inorganic...

Since the demo is fresh in our minds, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdGj6MJvT3Q) is IGN's Xbox One and PS4 comparison of the FFXV demo. While the look of the game certainly doesn't compare to the contemporaries of today, I believe no one can argue that the game didn't look phenomenal.

&#x200B;

When I was playing the demo, I had this really funny thought that FFXVI felt like the 360 version of Black Ops 3.


This isn’t a gaming article, it’s a marketing article.


It’s funny how amazed people are at competent leadership in game companies these days.


[deleted]


I’m glad they gave us such a large demo because it helped me realize that I’ll probably put this game on the back burner.

The combat is so fun but the 2 minute cut scenes after every 10 feet is pretty miserable and I forgot how excessive it is in the franchise. More than half of that demo was a cut scene with 2 solid fights mixed in.

If it wasn’t for how expensive games are now I wouldn’t be as critical but I have Zelda to hold me off until Starfield releases.


Noticing a trend. Many people who are interested in this are people who haven't been fans of ff games or weren't considering it. 

My opinion of the demo was simple disappointment. Though I should have expected it with the all action focus. But even things like the signaling if which eikon you're using is not done well. It's flashy but not as informative. The effect is barely different so you have to look at the gui. And because it's all action they can only give you so many options at one time. The game has to be accessible to people who do not bother changing eikons for example. They can't force you to explore deeper systems. They just have to put them in superficially 

I don't get the interest but I do get that people nowadays like that type of "look at me looking pointlessly cool" experience


[deleted]


If you've paid attention to square for the last few years this isn't a surprise. The DQ11S demo had close to 10 hours of content iirc


I swear, people use "masterclass" without even thinking. The demo being good doesn't make it a "masterclass in pre-launch marketing." Demos can have good or bad effects on a game's sales. It all depends on how good the demo and game are. That's all.


Excited for the game, demo was a ton of fun.

But I’m not picking it up until reviews. The performance in the demo was pretty terrible. I know it’s just a demo but poor performance isn’t a selling point. 

Just want to make sure I won’t be stuck playing at 30


Loved the demo.

But it also put me in thebwait camp. So many damn cut scenes.

I want to see if it was that bad to set up the story or is ut like that the whole game. So I will wait a few months


The final fight of the demo. I wanted to stop them from fighting. It was so harrowing to watch that because for a moment I forgot *who* was fighting. I was so lost in the visual beauty that when it all came rushing back, my gut dropped. 

And then the scene immediately afterward, my partner was sitting there, watching it all says to me, “You’re getting this.” It wasn’t a question.


Is this on PS4? Forgot


Am i the only one that was put off by the combat? Just seemed a bit boring…


Me after playing the 2 hour demo "I really enjoyed that movie".


Never played FF. Can I just jump into this? What’s the gameplay like?


playstation is amazing, i want to say!


I'm honestly glad for the demo to solidify for me that new FF is just not made for me anymore. There's a whole other generation that prefers this type of game. More power to them it seems like there are more of them than us.


I can’t stand how uninspired the GoT rip off portions are. Sick boy, a hound, a family member hated by the mom, relatives dying in traitorous attack…so uncreative


I wish the performance wasn’t such dog shit tho.


yes, we get it. ff16 is the 2nd coming of christ.


Same. Literally pre ordered it today based off how good the demo was.


Same. FFXV burned me and the trailers for 16 did absolutely nothing for me. 

The demo changed all that and I’m getting it day 1 now.


Same here. I was home sick and downloaded it for something to pass the time. Haven’t paid attention to 16 till now. I’ll be buying 16 because of how much I enjoyed the demo


I was trying to hold off buying it until the price got lower, then I played the demo... needless to say I pre-ordered the game


This comment is making me download the demo lol


Is the demo still available


It won me over, but I haven’t adjusted to $70 games yet. I plan on playing FF15 while waiting for a price drop


Demos have always been great like this! Remember the demo discs from magazines? It sucked that the trend of having a demo for almost every game died out. I used to put hours into demos back in the day


If developers aren't confident in their game being good, they won't release a demo because it might actually have a negative impact on sales. It's a gamble that gets more safe as the quality of the game goes up.


Cuz nowadays most games are broken on release so it’s easier to hide problems with just trailers and hype. It makes me think of CP2077 where CDPR didn’t even allow reviewers to use their own footage only approved CDPR footage could be used which was fake gameplay. We didn’t see what it actually looked like until launch. 

Hopefully all of the positive buzz for this demo leads more publishers to make them.


How does it blow anyone's mind?

Gamers keep buying games without demos and developers stop releasing demos because their game will be broken on day one

Then yet again, gamers keep buying games anyway so there's really no market pressure to incentivize a demo unless you're supremely confident that it's going to crush and impress


Demos are where Square excels, over half the games they put out in the last 18 months have had a demo. And of the ones that didn't most are remasters or games that are over a decade old.

From the business perspective of AAA studios, demos are almost never a profitable decision. You can hype audiences and get them to pre-order in other ways, all without revealing how trash and disappointing your half-baked product is.


I might be talking out of my ass but I remember there was research that proved that games with demos sold LESS than games without demos.

EDIT: me do dumb


Demos sell me on games far more consistently than any review. Midnight Suns, Cult of the Lamb, Weird West, Re4make, and Disney Speedstorm are some recent ones that come to mind.


iirc Sony is forcing this on AAA developers now with the PS5 right? I believe Forspoken was one of the first games affected by this new rule. That they had to have a demo ready for every game for the consumer to try 

At the very least first party games

Correct me if I'm wrong though, I remember seeing this news early in January this year


Just being able to pick up where you left off on the demo sold me. The start felt like a copy of game of thrones…. but after that Phoenix bite it left that behind. Also DMC x FF… can’t wait to play more wooo hooo pizza Clive


Same. I wasn’t going to get it for a bit, but the Game of Thrones style plot line from the demo had me hooked


I pre-ordered right after finishing the demo.

I genuinely think it's the first time I've pre-ordered anything.


The demo sold me. I was excited for the game from the start but the demo was so good that it blew me away. Hype is through the roof right now.


I’ve never played any Final Fantasy games before this demo. I also haven’t played any modern JRPGs at all. So, I’m a little bit confused…

What exactly is the gameplay loop in this game? From the demo, it seems like it was to watch a (very long) cinematic, followed by a dungeon crawl to kill a bunch of low-level monsters, then a dungeon boss, then back to the (very long) cinematic again. It doesn’t look like there is ANY gameplay between cinematic and dungeon crawling. Can someone help explain this?

Im hesitant about purchasing this game because I just don’t understand what there is to do outside of the combat. Other games like this usually break things up with exploration, or puzzles, or some down-time activities… but this demo didn’t have any of that other than a couple of sections where it had you walk 50 feet to open a door for the next cinematic to begin.


I thought I could resist Diablo but I couldn't... Finished Zelda last weekend and have been playing Diablo this week.  But yeah, totally dropping it as soon as my copy of FF16 arrives.


Diablo has been so much fun a real blast from the past. But when this comes out diablo is taking a back seat!


Embrace complete experiences. Reject predatory monetization.


I’m still trying to beat TotK before starting Diablo… I’m going to be so behind lol


Plus, fuck Blizzard in general


I told myself I'd wait one or more months before trying Diablo IV.  
Based on my friends, I may be waiting for years... Game is good but not transcendant according to them

And with Blizzard putting micro transactions everywhere for bullshit reason, I'm also worried about that.


Yoshi-P seems very competent at running projects. There's a reason they put him on this.


For real, FF15 was rough and even FF7R had to go through a re-do. Glad there are some directors that know what to do in SE.


How long does it take before you can actually play? I feel like I played over an hour and it's just all cutscene with like 4 walking sections where you do nothing but walk from A to B for like 20 seconds


Pretty common, at least with Switch games. 

And of those octopath traveler comes first to mind. I guess SE has been on top of their demo game for a while now.


I’m waiting for the day before to play the demo so I can basically just start a day early lol.


Very well said. Even better was having the Active Time Lore so If someone is curious and wants more details on what is happening, they can do that without clunky exposition segments.


Yeah, well said. Surprised me very much so as I’ve played lots of final fantasies but none have made me put one in my top ten or anything but damn I was hooked by demos end.


> who the villain was

Given it's a JRPG, I guarantee you who you think the villain is is not the main antagonist. They could be _one_ of the villains but usually ends up being nowhere near as dangerous as the actual main villain.

Same with

>what was at stake

FF has always been "here's what you think is the conflict happening" but by the end of the game, the true conflict is on a much bigger scale than from the beginning.


The writing is great, and I'll add the VA performances were astounding: Clive in particular is really well voiced, the scene toward the end of the demo was so well done. The music being awesome goes without saying, but it really all worked together to be extremely compelling as an intro.


And if you did want to get more into the factions, lore and stuff the active time lore is a brilliant feature.


I feel like a lot of the best Final Fantasies have great intros. 4, 6, and 7 especially all have great opening sequences that paint a picture of the setting and establish central character motivations.


You cock


XVI but the free trial of XIV is also accurate lol


I played Forspoken demo for about 3 minutes, realised it ran like shit on graphics mode and the graphics were the only thing it had going for it, uninstalled the demo and wrote the game off. The demo was perfect - it let me know exactly what the game was about and that I wanted no part in it.


I played forespoken demo for 4 minutes and decided it wasn't for me (or anybody, for that matter lol) and last night I played FF's demo and I gotta be honest. I was really impressed by almost everything (not the jump animation lol). Day 1 buy.


lol. I felt the same way. really had no intentions of playing this game but demo was really good. starts a bit slow with just a few seconds of gameplay and then cut scenes (back and forth)….but towards the end I was all in.


Let me know what you think when you finish it


The first BioShock game has a top tier opening. 

(I don't think it had a demo, but the first chapter of that game is incredible.)


Not only an interesting opening, but a finished product would actually be a great first step. Most games nowadays release in a half baked state and even though the opening is interesting, the performance issues are a big concern ( looking at you Jedi Survivor)


I remember the only reason I bought Tobal #1 on PlayStation was because it included the demo disc for FFVII.


The first 30 min was just basically cutscenes tho right? That was enough to convince you?


The first 30 minutes of the demo is 90% cutscenes, so I don't really get it?


I did the same exact thing. I can wait until Thursday, and then I'm diving straight into all of that.


The first 30 minutes are cutscenes and walking lol


Yeah I’ve decided just to not get the demo for the same reason, I’d rather just experience it all for the first time when I have the full game in my hands


Omg same. I finished the combat tutorial with Rodney (can’t believe I remember his name lol), took a little stroll in the courtyard and said: NOPE! I have to wait. I don’t even mind replaying everything all over again. It was that good.


how do you get the demo?


What a great wife, she already knew you’d like it.


You should try out the ff7 remake demo as well


No, all Final Fantasy games are stand alone unless explicitly stated otherwise. It’s an anthology series. This one has zero connection to previous games you can start with it.


No you don’t. :) Every FF is different, and only have some shared elements between them, like the Chocobos, Moogles and the summons (Eikons in 16). 

You can start with FF16.


They're all separate universes. You're fine to proceed.


All different worlds entirely.

It’s like alternate universes within the same multiverse. 

Each entry is on a different planet and they all have gods/summons that are mostly the same but kind of different at the same time in each installment. Like alternate universe versions. I’m talking about the gods inside the Eikons in this game like ifrit. 

Then some share resemblences like certain creatures reappearing. Those yellow birds called chocobos you ride are in most FF’s. Then some of the random animal mobs you’ll see. 

And I’m not sure if the other games are the same but in the description in the PlayStation store it says “Escape the fate of the dark crystals.” Idk what that means, but I only played FFXV and that had something to do with crystals. Also the game seems to take some inspiration from there (not too much though).


No. There are going to be Easter Eggs from the previous games because Squenix tends to use recurring elements/characters, but it will be its own story.


"What parts of the game were influenced by Game Of Thrones?"

Yoshi-P - "Yes"


I think about that line while laying in bed every night.


The MUSIC dude. God its so good


Your wife wanted a new show to watch 🤣 That's awesome dude, sounds nice~


i mean its very cinematic so im guessing the narrative grab her, pretty good backsitting expirience


Treasure that woman!


I preordered immediately after completing the demo.

If I can play a demo before release that represents the final product, I'm OK with preordering. It's the preorder gambling (blind trust) that is what promotes shitty releases.


Your wife is amazing


That’s a keeper.


It’s free, it short, and your progress will be saved if and when you play the actual game


EA, Activision and Ubisoft put an end to demos. They were scared you might find out their game was an unfinished p.o.s. before you had paid


Every numbered Final Fantasy is its own separate universe and story, you're fine jumping in anywhere.


This isn’t even remotely true, unless places like r/jrpg are the only sites you visit. People have been hyped for this game since it was announced


For the FF 14 players, we kind of knew this was going to be solid. We’ve had the pleasure of CBU3’s work for many years now


Huh? I saw lots of hype for FF16 well before the demo..


Not true on twitter. Hype has been going for a solid year amongst fans.


I mean, I was uninterested/skeptical of it.. but I definitely felt like I was in the minority. Most everyone I’ve talked to was clamoring for this game.


Yeah, I honestly don't think I've ever seen public opinion on a game shift this dramatically this quickly in a positive way it's kinda wild. The game went from moderate hype to Number 5 on the US PS Store a week before  it's even out.


> It is so hard to describe just how uninterested, skeptical or outright opposed much of the discussion around FF16 has been for the past year. Just a week ago, you couldn't find anyone outside of a very small group of people who were very interested in the game.

I don't know in which world you live but I literally only have seen positive things and anticipation for FF16 since it is revealed... and I'm not involved in any hardcore FF communities (literally never played one)


I think the latest trailers and sony showcase and summergamefest were also very important. That’s when the waves really started getting momentum and youtubers started saying the game looks good.


Lol there’s been hype for this game for years.


> It is so hard to describe just how uninterested, skeptical or outright opposed much of the discussion around FF16 has been for the past year. Just a week ago, you couldn't find anyone outside of a very small group of people who were very interested in the game.

I'm dying here lol, why are you making one of the most highly anticipated games of the entire year seem like it was only being anticipated by a niche group of underground hipsters until the demo dropped?


True, at the Sony showcase I had no interest in it at all. The last FF was crap, so I just assumed this would be more of the same. It wasnt, the demo was fucking brilliant


Made by a different team on a different game engine to FFVII so why wouldn't it be different.


Noticed that too. Was playing VIIR yesterday on PS5 and still some really impressive graphics/weight. 

I’m playing the XVI demo again now on both graphics and performance modes and it seems like he doesn’t have a ground shadow running around the castle. I wonder if that’s what makes his running/walking feel a bit floaty.


I felt the same way, I'm still going to eventually get it, but after the demo it's no longer on my day 1 list. I really enjoyed the story a lot, but the walking animations were jarring, and the framerate on Performance mode was not great, though I heard the launch version may fix that. And the motion blur was so severe, so I'm hoping they add some settings for that. But I did really like the combat and I do plan on buying the game eventually, just not right away.


I thought I was the only one not liking the movement animations...

Also, like other people said it feels more and more like an action game than a jrpg with mindless button mashing. I liked the direction of the remake of ffvii that kept some elements of tactical strategy during combats but I think those will be missing from this title


[deleted]


The constant cut scenes also killed it for me. I was day one and decided to wait until it's on sale now. Combat was great but seriously my momentum was killed by the numerous unneeded cut scenes.


Yeah the frame drops and motion blur were not good.  I'm holding off pre-ordering until I see more.  People will claim it's due to an older build for the demo but I don't think they put that out there if it was going to perform worse than the day one game.  No excuse for bad performance in a game made exclusively for one console.


Yes, most people did. Just don’t tell the ff16 sub.

Performance is average 30-50, which is below the PS5 vrr threshold so you can’t even count on that.

Everyone’s saying it’s just a demo don’t worry. But I think it’s reasonable to wait for reviews


Don’t know about 15, but Remake definitely looks better. As for the FPS drop - it was very noticeable, but I hope they’ll fix it on release (demo is an older version).


There’s a whole combat demo that unlocks after you finish the prologue.


I didn't want to think this because it might just be that I'm in the minority about this demo/game, but, yeah, the amount of hype around the demo is suspiciously a little over the top.


glad i’m not the only one. i plan on trying it later today, but i watched my boyfriend play and it was slightly better than ok. the cutscenes seemed excessive and the combat system didn’t seem that deep. i’m mostly interested in hearing more of the music, seeing more locations, and the prospect of having more kaiju battles


Honestly didn't see the hype about the story it seems pretty basic revenge story setup right now. Half the characters died with hardly any development it was pure shock value. 

  
I will say the combat when it is not interrupted by constant cutscenes or qtes is pretty good.


So you're telling me you don't think pressing an extra button to open big doors is substantial!?


Devs have said QTEs aren’t as frequent the further you get into the game. And each Eikon battle will play differently, so the Phoenix one likely will be a one-off


Yeah, I was hoping with their confidence in the release that the performance mode would be locked 60 or at least close to it. Even on my VRR display, I couldn't handle the fps drops and had to play in the graphics mode. I'm honestly considering holding off until the inevitable PC release.

The 30fps mode did feel surprisingly good at least. It's just so strange not to prioritize performance in an action focused game like this


The demo is on an earlier build.


That’s how it ends too


There will be more fights between eikons throughout the game, but they're not really the main piece of combat gameplay. They're more cinematic experiences that serve the story more than the gameplay. Granted, the eikon fights will be more involved later in the game than what you started the demo with.


It's an introduction to the eikon battles. It's supposed to be easy. I didn't care since it was awesome to look at.

But there won't be another one like that. Each eikon battle is different.


I'm glad you're just now discovering what a prologue is.


Same. 45 mins in and I was like wtf. The combat was just button mashing also.


Great atmosphere/art direction, great characters, great voice acting, epic music, great story, great graphics, great combat. You need more variety in the type of games you play if you see this game as meh. Or you clearly are the type of person who isn't into rpgs with a story.


You know that is the prologue, right?


......I'm sorry what?

He refuses to play it because it might be better and beat other games? Am I reading this right? Jesus the hills gamers die on.


Oh man I don't even own a switch but I just cannot see TotK losing GOTY, that game seems like a dam masterpiece lol.


Please tell your friend that a stranger on the internet is laughing at his stubborn decision.


[deleted]


Maybe the very first fight against trolls lol. That will not work against other foe..


Triangle attacks are meant to be filler attacks when you're out of range of an enemy and are running up to them/waiting for an opening to an attack. If you've ever played Devil May Cry it's very similar to the gun attacks in those games.


Before the demo I've maybe seen 1 video about it in months.


Your save data transfers to the full game so you can finish the demo if you want


Seems like they are attractive different gamers. People who didn't care much for ff games


The shift is because there were lots of people hesitant about it, especially after 15. When the demo came out and it was actually good, people were sold on it.


Honestly every AAA game these days is hyped beyond belief its either a piece of shit or goty no inbetween.

Most likely SE bought more than streamers to praise the game they bought redditors as well.


art criticism on the internet has actually been dead for so long. if it’s not positive enough to get clicks it’s a waste. if it’s not negative enough to get retweets then it’s a waste. it’s fucking dumb


We’ve not had competent leadership in such a long time that when games like this come along it’s a welcome surprise. Although, Sony first party games are very well made.


Sorry you feel that way. I’ve played 6-10 and 13-15, seems clear this will be the best FF game in decades rivaled only by 14.


How does it immediately throw you into the action? I think it was over 30 mins before I did anything beyond moving the left stick to walk in order to kick off another cut scene.


Demo was an older build so I’m hoping the launch build is better. I was overall fine with performance but lack of a toggle for motion blur seems odd to me.


Same here, along with now 2 of my friends.

I'd love to see their pre order numbers before and after the demo


The little “pre order now” popped up at the end of the demo and I just said “you fuckers” and immediately did it, haha.


As a life long final fantasy fan - I love reading this kinda comment.


Idk what all the hate for FFXV is about. Game was gorgeous, combat was excellent, story was amazing. Eikons were the best I'd ever seen. 

I feel like pushing the car really made people hate the game. Despite the car being one of the best parts of the game. When you find out it flies?? Just amazing.


Hilariously, the Episode Duscae early demo for FFXV was significantly better than the actual game ended up being.


Did you play the game on day 1? It felt unfinished when I played it and haven't touch it since beating it


Your comment got me to play it, I'm on the last day of vacation. Holy fucking shit, that was a wild ride. I'm buying it.


I’ve never played a FF game in my life. Played the 16 demo, immediately downloaded 15. Need to see what all this is about lol


On the other side, it's pretty easy to cheese the demo, and have it give a different representation of the rest of the game.

Digital Foundy has made a video on this, showing that many game designers will put a vast majority of their time in the first few hours of the game, since that's where a lot of players quit playing anyways, and where most form their opinions on whether their friends should buy.

I love demos, but I don't think that would save us from buying unfinished games.


Even if a demo is good, sometimes people won't buy the game because it's already "scratched that itch". It's not just about being good, it's that there is a significant market to win by releasing it that's bigger than the one you can lose. In other words, if a lot of people are going to buy your game already, a demo can only hurt.


Tell that to Forspoken lol


It also takes a lot of work to make a demo, even if it's mostly just the first hour of a game. That's dev time taken away from finishing the game on time, and we all know most games have a hard enough time releasing without demos as it is.

  I seem to recall demos faded out the last 10 years as companies found they didn't really help sales.


yoshi P is pretty much known for running a tight ship

&#x200B;

theres no day one patch planned for XVI


I actually talked for a good while with someone defending the lack of demos on the basis that they lead to lower sales.


[deleted]


> He's the guy who's made a good third of FFXIV completely free, so no surprise that he's going to put work into game-selling free content.

Have you tried the critically acclaimed Action RPG Final Fantasy XVI? With a free demo which you can play through the entirety of the 2 hour Prologue and the stunning Eikonic Challenge mode, all for free with no restrictions on playtime!


Eh, Square Enix is one of the few companies who regularly release demos for their games. Still remember how mindblowing the demo for Bravely Default was for me.


> games with demos sold LESS than games with demos.

I think you forgot an "out". I'm guessing it's the second half that has the out?


I remember the same. Also it takes away from the regular development work to make them. It's no wonder why they're less common.


It has nothing to do with Sony, square has been putting demos out for more than 5 years


That’s game trials, which are just small trials of the actual game.


It was a good hook, I usually buy games after reviews are out, but this demo was so good, and I really like the mature theme, and characters.


WHAT I DIDNT KNOW THAT. I literally stopped playing cause I didn’t wanna spoil shit for myself when I got the game lol


It takes a lot to get me invested into a story in a game or show.

The fact this game was able to hook me to the story and leave me desperate for more in under two hours is a massive feat. And that final boss battle might be the most gorgeous boss battle I have ever played.

I have only ever played F7 Intergrade but inject this game into my veins.


I liked all the swearing and I can’t explain why


I'm definitely interested, but I can't quite get over just how much of the character dynamics have been lifted straight from GoT. You've got a young prince who has no right to the throne and so devotes himself to being a soldier, who has a mother who hates him for no fault of his own, a father who he has a strong bond with but who gets decapitated early in the story, a sickly little brother who develops special powers, a giant wolf that grows up alongside him, a little sister who gets separated from him until they reunite all grown up... I'm sure the game will take everything in a different direction from GoT once it gets going, but it’s hilarious to me how much it feels like *this* is the Triple-A JRPG that George R. R. Martin worked on and not Elden Ring.


I wonder if this will follow GOT and have nudity.


yep  i was trying to resist preordering and wanted to wait for a price drop.

&#x200B;

:X deluxe ordered


If it's anything like other FF games it will have a tonne of other things to do other than fighting. I'm assuming they picked the prologue and a dialogue heavy section to display as the real time fighting is vastly different from past games and everyone loves ff cutscenes.

So yeah it'll probably have what you want but they chose to show the combat first and foremost which will be the meat and bones.


It's pretty much the exact same gameplay loop as GOW.

Keep in mind the demo is essentially the prologue so its ofc going to be cutscene heavy


Final fantasy games are typically front-loaded with a lot of story in the beginning hours and then opens up. There will be areas to explore, do side quests etc. There's a bounty system called "hunts" that have you go into the world to hunt down certain enemies. They have said there will be a sort of arcade mode to replay certain areas that will have leaderboards attached to it. I'm sure they will have a bunch of other things to do, like in any rpg.

But yeah, i can see the concern if it gave the idea the whole game will be move forward 2 feet and hit a cutscene.


I'm in the exact same shoes you are in, with experience. 

I liked the writing, but really didn't enjoy the gameplay.


I mean even the fighting itself boils down to “dodge a bunch while poking until enemy staggers, then unload big dmg when enemy does stagger”. 

Having watched footage of high level gameplay, it’s still the same thing. So really, besides all the cool visuals, the game does seem shallow when you unravel the cool exterior.


Man, I'm like 120 hours deep into Zelda, and I still have like half of the map to uncover. I honestly feel like I have another 2-3 months of playing before I wrap it up. I'm loving it, but I'm not sure I've ever played a game this big before.


same. I think D4 is fun, but its not on the level of TotK and possibly FF16.


What a time to be alive , to have those three options.


It’s literally just cosmetics that you don’t need to buy (this is coming from a 30 something year old who is exasperated at the current state of gaming/monetization/etc)


You don't have to pay for anything extra in Diablo though? Diablo isn't a complete game?


Dude there’s way too many great games out all at once, why couldn’t some of these have been released in 2022, that was a completely dead year in terms of AAA releases.


[deleted]


" Micro transactions everywhere" while you say you've never played, it's very fucking clear you've never even watched gameplay videos. I've dumped maybe 80 hours in and I've never come across any micro transactions. I've finished the main story and I'm grinding end game.


He learned a lot from the director of FF XIV


YoshiP don’t fuck around


What do you mean by a, “re-do”?


Yeah, this game has 11 hours of cutscenes (confirmed by the devs) but I imagine a lot of them aren’t gonna be phoned in or padded out because ATL allows for the scenes to just showcase the essential stuff.


Yeah, the active time lore on the touchpad is genius. Having it adapt to what's on the screen is a great innovation


It's a JRPG, we all know by the end we are gonna find and kill god.


Sure, but for what I’m talking about, that doesn’t matter. There’s a compelling conflict right off the bat which is good, doesn’t matter if it changes into something else


The female antagonist with the vaping stick ( I forgot her name) was really well acted too


Isn't 14's trial the entire game and the first expansion or something ridiculous like that?


Exactly my experience.


i’ll probably make a separate post about it because it’s 7pm, i’m watching a movie in an hour and by the time i get home it’s like 11pm and by then i’ll probably go to bed even though it’s friday


It did have a demo I remember playing it over and over


They really liked the cutscenes lol


Demo progression carries over ;)


Playstation store, go the game page, click on game editions, then there should be an option to download the demo.


It's on the playstation store.


Really hoping those Moogles show up. Cute fuckers. Excited to see them again. And Cactuars. And Tonberry too.

Lotta things I love from throughout the series. Cute fuckers I hope show up but may not fit into the dark aesthetic.


Most Monsters, Crystals & Cid to add.


Soken is a genius


Or to play it herself! Watching isn't enough for a lot of us. We want to play just as much or even more than you guys, _trust_ me. And to show you guys how it's done!


its an interactive game of thrones that will likely not fumble the ending


They had me from giant monster fights in the trailer.


Yeah i cant praise them enough for their love for their own games. From design, music, to translation/localization. Everything is always top notch.


Agreed, but amongst fans is a more disaggregated group compared to what I think OP means. I think they mean people like myself who never played a FF game all the way through to wanting this game more than any other.


I feel like the people aware of this game the past year or two fall into three groups:

* Those who weren't aware the game was made by the FF14 devs/Yoshi-P and who very clearly remember the shitshow that was FF15 at launch (and are thus skeptical), 
* Those who are aware the game was made by the FF14 devs/Yoshi-P and know that this game will be nothing like the shitshow FF15 was, and  
* Those who have no prior or recent FF experience at all

Those who were always hype for this game fall into #2


Funny you say that, it gets a lot of hate on the regular FF sub for not being turn-based lol


Demo was an old build as far as I know. I'm hoping some of that stuff is improved in the final release. Unlikely but I can hope.


Agreed; the combat seems incredibly shallow once you look past the flashy animations. 

Even the high level footage looked a bit disappointing because it all boiled down to “dodge a bunch, poke until stagger, then unload”. Doesn’t seem to have any other fighting styles which is disappointing because Stranger of Paradise had a near-infinite amount of options with its class system and so did FF7R with materias. 

Also, fuck me is Clive generic. Like painfully generic fantasy character.


To be fair to the Eikonic Challenge demo, the game auto equips you with three assist rings which make it way easier. If you remove them the combat is more challenging and you have to use your brain instead of dodge windows slowing time and appearing on screen and your dog automatically attacking


And tutorials for every stupid little thing. Like even the most mundane obvious things. It was exhausting. The first 30 minutes honestly felt like there was a tutorial or a cut scene every five seconds.


Exactly that’s what put me off is this is a next Gen exclusive. How can I boot up ff15 and it looks on par or better than the demo on my PS5? 

I’m a hardcore final fantasy fan also and usually buy it without looking but this one literally has me thinking maybe I’ll wait a bit


One guy got an early copy and did a frame test, seems to be exactly the same as the demo


Idk about that chief. Did you not see the goddamn Eikon fight as you literally ran through the level in the background? I think it looks phenomenally good. 

Didnt have any issues with frame rate either but I know that can vary for people.


Thanks. That sounds great.


Quality mode has been good for me but not much of a difference so not sure why the two modes, maybe on PS5 it's gonna have to be the mode to use. Feels less jarring to go to cutscenes from it as well.


I never had any drops during combat but just walking around had some really bad drops especially when there’s fire on the screen. I might try the 30fps lock so see if it feels better overall.


People got the game early and it still has the performance issues. Shame, but the fps drops were tolerable for me.


Damn that sucks. Why would they design it like that? Its so so bad haha. Im enjoying everything else but those specific segments are just terrible haha


I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. Is all of this never ending praise just due to fanboyism? This demo was mostly awful. I thought the part where the castle was under attack redeemed it a little bit, but then that “spam the triangle” button sequence for 5 minutes at the end of the demo was awful too.


[deleted]


The amount of hate this game is generating from other fan bases is wildly sad. There’s no shortage of dumb hot takes like this one over in the subreddit, and from random “gaming” articles. First game to look and feel like a true next gen title and some can’t cope.


7 Remake was the best FF game since 10, but this is right up there in my opinion. 

I dont get this whole thing people are saying about "newer fans seem to like this". FF has always been a series that tries to do something different. Games are allowed to change.

IIRC, they were actually kinda worried about their preorder numbers pre demo


Probably the pacing and the way they handle FFXV is the problem.

While I don't have problems with the game personally I do notice that after Hydrean fight it kinda becomes a point of no return which I did not expect at all and It just feels like its missing the middle part and rushes to the endgame.

Not to mention the lore, if your a big fan of that, you gotta do a lot of [stuff](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2094194252) before tackling the main game to make sense of the whole story.

There's other stuff to complain but personally i enjoyed the experience.


As someone who enjoyed FFXV overall, it's story was its weakest point. And the story is what FF games are known for.

At launch, FFXV had a VERY incoherent story that was not even finished. 

It literaly REQUIRED a prequel movie, an anime, 5 DLC chapters and a full REWORK of some of its chapters to make the story make sense.

The DLC chapters should SUPPLIMENT the story, not be required viewing to understand what happened in the main story.

The main villain was terribly explained and vastly under-utilized. Same for the main love interest.

Again, i liked XV and Gladio is one of my fav FF chars.

But, the story was abysmally bad. It was VERY difficult to get invested in the story when so much of it was just random shit happening with very little explanation.

And tons of characters introduced that you couldn't care about because they had about 20 minutes total of screentime in the story and no actual time to develop.

Hell the major plot point of the love interest happens after you've seen her like maybe twice for 30 seconds each. How are you supposed to care about what happens from that?


You also can't use the Royal Edition which came out like 2 years later to say XV has a good story. Because all the bad reception and lasting bad impressions came from launch.

Anyone who wrote XV off from launch wasn't gonna invest money in the DLC or royal editions to see the story that should have been there from the start. Only people who ALREADY liked the game were gonna do that.


Thus why XV gets a very well deserved bad wrap. Because it was a disaster at launch and for a VERY good time afterwards.


>story was amazing.

The story was the issue with the problems it had that the DLCs they put out have to make up for it.


Horrid pacing, end set piece was half of the game. Open world was bare. Combat was clunky. Eikons were pretty yes but only came at certain random points. The flying car was a massive hassle to take off and land, and was practically worthless post-game.


The biggest problems were initial release. The game was literally not finished. There were ( I think ) 2 free updates that basically patched major plot holes with things that were left out and I think people were a little salty you needed multiple dlc to get the full picture. 

If you buy the royal edition for $20 on amazon it’s good. But for day 1 people it was a shitshow. 

I still dislike how all the battles are hold circle to win, also sometimes heal or revive your people. It’s extremely easy and all semblance of strategy ( which final fantasy is built on ) is gone.

Edit: and when I say not finished, I don’t mean day 1 patch, I mean there were updates like 3 and 6 months out and they were like “hey now if you replay the game you can get all your questions answered about character X and events behind plot hole Z”


It was just a worse version of every other open world rpg I had already played. Plus if you didn't watch the movie or the anime, there'd be literally no setup for the game. And the pacing is awful. The whole thing just felt incomplete and soulless. I felt zero emotion at the end because the game did such a bad job at setting things up. The FFXVI demo made me feel 100x more AND did an amazing job of setting things up in just 2 hours.


Last third of the game was very different than the first two thirds. Spent so much time getting good at fun group combat. Then the end is a timed button press QTE extravaganza with mostly one character. I loved the first two thirds. I expected to hate the boy band characters but grew to actually love them! Then the last third was a huge disappointment.


15 at launch was practically a different game, and many peoples opinions were based on that version before it got fixed


Have you played any other Final Fantasy? FFXV ranks among the worst in the franchise.

Story was missing half the content behind a movie, an comic, and some half-baked DLC.

Open world with lackluster side quests and almost no content.

Gameplay was OK. There was other JRPGs doing it better back then.

Graphics were really good, I'll give you that.

Just 2007-2018 was not a great time to be a Final Fantasy fan.
13,14, and 15 were just ko well received at launch. Only 14 seems to have improved as time went on.


Look, FFXV is fine, I personally like it a lot, but the way it was released was unacceptable. People have absolutely every right to be leery of XVI because it -- and the whole Fabula Nova Crystallis project in general, really-- damaged the image of the FF brand for *over a decade*. I was in high school when XIII, Versus, and Agito were announced. I'm almost in my mid 30s now. SE needs to regain that trust and their shoddy PR lately hasn't been helping.


>I feel like pushing the car really made people hate the game. 

Okay I've heard this take twice this week. Doesn't that sequence at the beginning take less than a minute? I've played this game a lot and I never felt at all inconvenienced by it. I actually like the tone it sets. Am I crazy or do people really need nonstop action to appreciate a game? 

Honestly the ff16 demo tutorial was more annoying than 15's opening. With all the "walk 10 feet then watch a movie" and the never ending pop-ups explaining how to open the menu and stuff. It's still a day one buy for me because I'm not desperately searching for a reason to hate games.


> Idk what all the hate for FFXV is about.

I say this as a lifelong final fantasy fan who has played every single final fantasy game 

FFXV was boring, the characters were mostly bleh, the combat felt terrible (somewhat due to performance and somewhat due to movement issues), the product placement was downright insulting. FFXV was the only numbered mainline final fantasy game I did not beat and is IMO a dark blemish on the series name.

Anyway the XVI demo seems great.


as someone who really enjoyed 15 when it came out, there's a reason i haven't replayed it, as a whole, the game was just fine, the story is weird and at relase it was missing like... the whole thing before the ending, which ofc its bad, but it was carried by these 4 dudes and their comradery, the combat was FLASHY, but it wasnt actually that good, remember playing on hard and it was a lot of mashing and triangle abuse, ff7remake did it sooooo much better, the world/graphics were quite good and the music was fucking incredible, some sidequest were really boring and felt like a drag/cheap way to increase playtime. Car was weird, flying with it was cool but I remember you got it pretty late in the game and flying with it was a mess but i dont really recall that well that part.

So it has lots of faults but still was enjoyable cause of the main cast and a few other things. I really liked it but it's not a great game, it was not a finished product.


I loved the game and then hated it not because of the car. But with how the story was told after chapter 9, it felt rushed. Then later I found out it was an unfinished game and the true ending was released as a book.


Combat was janky and clumsy, open world was barren outside of awful fetch quests, and the story felt cobbled together compared to what Versus was hinting at.


FFXV had a terrible story! It was so unfinished that they needed to make a movie and an anime to explain stuff. 

Most of the game is about trying to get a boat and your party randomly disappear so you'll buy DLC.


Because the story is completely forgettable with absolutely terrible pacing and as far as action combat games go, the combat in XV is complete shit. The contrast in quality between the combat in XVI and XV is insane.


Combat was amazing? Was this the first game you've ever played?


I know opinions are subjective but man you got me wondering if we played the same FFXV


it was GOOD, the disappointment and fractured nature of the whole story is what held it back from being GREAT.

I loved all of it, even named my cat after Aranea, but I think the criticism is well deserved.


The FFXV open-world experience was wonderful. The game was pretty and fun. Once you continue the story and leave the open world, though, the game goes on rails and throws a bunch of messy Final Fantasy plot at you way too quickly and I felt the story kind of fell apart.


try the ff7 remake!


Reminds me of MGSV's first mission. I was expecting the rest of the game to have the same production values.


do you remember what video that might have been? i’d like to watch it if you can remember


Not a game demo but when they released the first 7 mins of the latest Mortal Kombat movie, I was so hyped. Sub Zero vs Scorpion, an amazing fight scene, a great foundation (re)done.

Then we got Cole Young.


Forspoken was a great game killed by haters. The game built up very slow but mid game and end game is epic. I have played it twice


I believe the demo version is 1.01, and the "Day 1" patch will be 1.03.


Well let's hope they dont keep that promise and do provide a day 1 patch cause the demo ran pretty bad, dipping to low 40's

&#x200B;

Unfortunately that is true according to the data. But the conclusion is not that demos lower game sales, but that specifically demos of incomplete games lower game sales


Yup. Famously Dragon Quest XI S’ demo gives you like the first ten hours of the game, longer than many indie games last total. It worked on me, though, got me invested.


I usually avoid demos for the same reason. This is literally the first roughly two hours of the game and since your save transfers it's basically just getting a small head start.


I actually enjoyed the fight right before the last one more.

The last fight was visually striking but honestly a little boring to play IMO.

I’m still dying for more.


I haven't heard (or read) a single swear word since FF7 back in '97 and it always kinda irked me. Also I'm loving that there's a bit more blood to be seen compared to previous games. Feels like a more mature FF especially with that Game of Thrones vibe.


God of War is primarily environmental and traversal puzzles with combat throughout. There was no hint that there would be puzzles of any kind in this demo, though.


I do agree with that, I thought the combat was just button mashing the same couple of combos over and over again. The “basic” attacks were also completely worthless as they hardly did any damage whatsoever, so you’re just poking and dodging while waiting for your special attack meters to fill up. What is even the point of that fireball attack (triangle button) when it only does like 30 damage when enemies have  thousands of hit points?

What I did like is the sense of “power” that all the combat animations gave you. The game makes you feel powerful in a way that most other games don’t. I guess this is the main reason why most people are enjoying it, and I thought it was pretty cool, too. 

I also liked that the game was EXTREMELY generous in regenerating the power attack meters. In most games like this, I always would save those types of power attacks only for the bosses, but here you can unload on even the most basic enemies because you know the meter will fill up again within less than 30 seconds.


I wasn't *super* impressed with the combat, but it's still better than The Witcher 3--which is one of the best games ever made.


Never played Elden Ring?


D4 is fun but so empty. I miss the D3 style of skills. That slow drip kinda forced you into different playstyles.

This one, soon as my rogue hit 3 and had Rapid Fire, that is the only attack skill i used because it was so good.


Yep. Diablo 4's great fun. The story was actually worth paying attention to this time around as well.


Just because they aren't required to play the game doesn't mean they aren't predatory. 

1. In-game currency that doesn't give you the exact amount that you need for a cosmetic 
2. Cash shop with rotating inventory to create artificial scarcity and increase FOMO
3. Battle Pass system which incentivizes you to play the game full time to reap any reward, while introducing an additional sense of FOMO if you don't log in to collect the reward (Coming Soon)
4. Cash shop armor and mount design that look much better than anything that can be earned in the game through reasonable effort (This is subjective)

I would be curious to see what other nasty sort of monetization features/practices they introduce in the future. If you believe they won't after WoW, WoW Classic, Overwatch, and Diablo Immortal, I've got a bridge to sell you. 

But I'm not knocking on you for playing the game. If it's fun and you're enjoying yourself, there's no shade. 

But let's not pretend like we're not going easier on a game because it brings us enjoyment.


It's mtx in a full priced game bro. 5 years ago everyone would have been screaming bloody murder. Just a shame what these companies have been able to get away with.


A live service video game
I want to see how the updated will go


Coincidentally also named Yoshida. I wonder if they've ever met.


For context: Square Enix originally was outsourcing a good part of FF7R to Cyber Connect 2. As I recall their work was behind deadlines and below the expected quality, so Square threw out all their work and did it in-house.


Re-do is an improper word sorry. But they had to abandon cyber connect 2’s work that they did on FF7R.


If only Hideo Kojima could learn how to do this… Lol


It’s like the Amazon X-ray thing. Which I wish every streaming service had.


Benedikta

It's called a "pipe".

Kids these days....


You mean the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 for free with no restrictions on playtime!


Yup, with some restrictions like not being able to use the market board or join a Free Company (a guild basically).


yup, entire base game and entire first expansion including the patching leading up to the third expansion, and like 13 battle class jobs all which you can level up to 60.


What's your shoe size?


What’s your social security number?


We did not ask for any of that


Yeah Bioshock is one of the specific games I think of when I'm reminiscing about the time when demos were more of a thing. That and Just Cause 2.


To be fair, they are pretty sick!


I know haha, which makes it enticing but I know that if I play that demo any further I will want more, making it harder to wait! The hype is unreal though, excited for it to release either way!


It's a PS5 exclusive, but it will be on the PSN store


in this one though...I don't know...I don't wanna see a moogle get decapitated or anything haha


Hope so too. I feel like they wouldn't leave details like that out, but maybe it messes with framerates or something

The stagger system just completely lacks variety in general all attacks work on all enemies and you can use the same strategy on every enemy basically. FF7R every boss fight felt unique it was actually crazy how much variety the bosses had both in quantity and amount of unique gimmicks and strategies. Tons of abilities to utilize even without counting Materia which is also crazy in depth.

 I didn't really appreciate it until I played other games even the magic system was more complex than just hitting elemental weakness(fire does more dmg and has small aoe, ice does more stagger and has big aoe but is far harder to hit, lightning automatic hit but cost more mp, and wind is a delayed attack that can stick to an enemy.) You can actually plan around the aggro system since the enemy targets the character you are playing as more.

FF16 just feels less rpg more action based there is no real incentive to actually play around with your setups since everything can be beat with the base kit quite easily. Doing those flashy charged shots and burning blades combos in the air does far less dmg than staying on the ground using your eikonic abilities as well making those seem counterintuitive to beating enemies efficiently.


Fuck. Now I’m sad


Which is great for ya! Don’t let anyone try to tell you different, ignore the frame drops if you don’t notice it

But factually the frame rate dips down to 30s and probably is at best 50s


Warning though, it allegedly spoils a bit of the story.


That's a good point, it definitely made the transition to cutscenes smoother. The increased clarity was nice too so I don't really have too much of a problem experiencing it that way.

Hopefully they implement a 40fps mode for people with 120hz displays at some point, that would be a nice middle ground


I hope there's a patch. But tbh you can tell they did try their best to optimize it. And yeah like you said, they were tolerable for me.


I well say I just finished the demo also and it's definitely got my attention wayyyy more now. However these 10/10 greatest demo ever are insane. I enjoyed the Lies of P demo way more. Like I said I do admit the end of the demo left me wanting more.


Your  opinion is garbage. That's all i need to know.


I just don't get it. I just like games and want them to be good.

God I really really don't want to start some console wars bullshit, especially as a Switch owner myself, but I find the TotK players especially sensitive. Needing to loudly proclaim TotK the greatest revolution in gaming that is certain to win goty any time FF16's eligibility comes up in conversation. Like Im super glad people like TotK, but the reactionary defense it gets despite already being top dog is wild.


FF7R was my goty 2020, so damn good. And I agree, it’s an attitude that makes no sense to me when looking at the series as a whole. People are still discounting this new golden era of FF, and it puzzles me.


> FF has always been a series that tries to do something different. Games are allowed to change.

This isn't really different unless you mean different from other ff games. hack and slash is nothing new and it didn't feel like it was as good as dmc looks or as older god of war games played. It's just flashier. 

Games can change, but ff7r already did this better. This is devolving.


not just amazon

https://books.rakuten.co.jp/ranking/daily/006515/#!/1

I think it's pretty much everywhere


I believe that report was based on...*questionable* sources.


Supposedly this was only about Japan pre orders which makes sense. Not too many have PS5s there.


That was a false post from the same person who recently said sony was not happy with it's VR2 sale numbers. 

The level of FUD thrown at sony even before the ps5 was released, has been disgusting and unwarrantied. I have been taking no notice of the false reporting been shown towards sony for awhile now.


>While I don't have problems with the game personally I do notice that after Hydrean fight it kinda becomes a point of no return which I did not expect at all and It just feels like its missing the middle part and rushes to the endgame.

That's a very valid criticism, I think I agree.


Having just played the main FFXV game and having touched none of the ancillary pieces...bruh. Maybe this would have helped my understanding and enjoyment of the game. It felt like I was playing Kingdom Hearts where random shit was happening that the game pretended I should know about.

&#x200B;

Is there any "required reading" for XVI prior to release?


Honestly, I almost feel like the Pocket Version works better with how they told the story, since the story felt kind of abbreviated as it was.


The lore thing is what pisses me off the most about 15 and has stopped me from any replays. There’s ways to extend/expand your universe, and that wasn’t one of them.


Eh, Gladio's Dark Souls Adventure and Prompto's Shooting Gallery weren't necessarily revolution pieces of plot that I needed to feel like I got a complete story. Maybe Ignis DLC. Maybe.

The real problem was, Kingsglaive wasn't included in the game as a playable Chapter 0. A two hour, linear "tutorial" experience that could have easily enhanced the overall experience.

Regardless, I still thoroughly enjoyed FFXV, and was probably the first time I felt truly connected with my party members, and not just liked them as characters. I think it was the fact that they were not controllable, initially, and the A.I. had them moving and acting in a way that may them feel a lot more real. It was at the end when Prompto >!had me choose a photo!< where it really hit me. I originally gave two flux about >!taking photos!<, and kind of thought it was stupid. It clicked to me that >!me and the chocobros weren't coming out of this alive, and so let's enjoy one last memory of us where we were happy without any worries, and so it took me a long ass time to choose a photo!<.

In conclusion, my experience with FF in general is, there are no "bad" mainline FFs. Just favorites and less favorites. Spin-offs, however...


The DLCs werent **Finishing** the story, they were fleshing it out more... the story is centered atound Noctis.


The wife and I were just talking about this yesterday after finishing the demo. She mentioned how this demo piqued the interest while being one contained story. We did not have to watch a movie, anime or read a book (the one with the true ending? never read it) to get the full grasp of it.


I've gotten into xiv lately and it is great, but my understanding is that was pretty terrible at launch.

I still wish they would called it and xi "final fantasy online" or something instead of being a numbered entry though.


[deleted]


Awh I like 13 :(

Spot on re: the side quests in 15. No substance. Also, not required at all. I just blaze through the main story then tackle end game. It's not a binary, things can be good despite flaws.


Ive been playing FF my entire life lmao. Nice try to just discredit my opinion. My favourite is FF tactics and 15.


FFXV sold over 10 million copies and was the fastest selling game in the franchise. Does that really count as damaging the brand? I guess we will see how 16 does, but 15 sold incredibly well, 7 Remake was super popular, 14 is raking in cash and people are excited for 16. Final Fantasy generally seems to be on an upswing the last 5 years outside of the people who still want it to be turn based.


Yeah, I don't know why people think that's the reason people disliked 15. The pacing of the story is terrible, with loads of it locked behind other pieces of media and dlc. The combat is basic as all get out, and there's this huge world to traverse, yet nothing really interesting to see as it's pretty empty. Oh, and don't get me started on the immersion breaking real-world advertisements. Ahh, such a fantastic looking world. Let me stop by this cup noodle stand, I hope they accept American express.


Ff15 had a terrible opening. You were doing chores for a gas station girl with zero urgency to anything. They should’ve started off with the city being under attack and you having to escape, then maybe push the car for a small respite. It’s hard to argue for the story pacing in ff15, they admitted it was cut all over the place for the various bullshit movie and anime series tie ins that nobody wanted. Ff16 starts off cutscene heavy but they’re engaging cutscenes with amazing acting and tone. Can’t say the same for ff15 tho I do like the game.


I’ll see if I can find it when I get back from work. I know Alex was in it.


A very good game. It has its faults, don't get me wrong... but I had a blast with it.


I really liked the demo for forspoken but I couldn't see myself paying $70 for it at launch. 

...but when it drops to $25 I might pick it up.


Different strokes.


What's on the disc should be V1.03


[deleted]


That has to be an isolated occurrence, played the demo at performance and got buttery smooth 60fps the whole time. Played it in fidelity and even at 30fps the game was smooth kind of like console rdr2 is


I'm all for that


Do you recommend picking up the demo since it sounds like it's the beginning of the overall story?

I wasn't going to get it because I wanted to be completely surprised on release, but if the demo is basically the prologue, I'm getting it.


I agree but the music and visuals made it up for me. And like you said, we already got a dope actual boss fight beforehand so I was all in for the spectacle. Felt like I was fighting the Balrog.


Seems like there's always a nice fight before the Eikon spectacle fight, which is good.

That Dragoon fight was great.


It had to be simple as the first Eikon fight but i get you. The spectacle alone just blew me away.


The thing is that combat seems to be a major, major focus of FF16 since it has a full-on real-time combat with launches and whatnot. It doesn’t have an open world, nor does it have involved side-quests. 

Idk. I can see this game get old REAL fast if that rotation is the only thing available.


Oh yeah! One of my favorites. 

I 100%'d that game in about 140 hours though. I feel like TotK absolutely DWARFS Elden Ring in size, and things to do. I don't want to post any spoilers on here.


D3 took years to become what it was. It was an absolute disaster at launch


I personally hated that D3 gave you everything. I like the feeling of choice and decisions in RPGs. Even though you can respec for cheap in D4, it pushes you towards an ever-growing, specific build.


I'm trying to enjoy it but it just feels so repetitive to me. I feel like Diablo 3 might have been more fun or maybe I just wasn't sick of this type of game at that point in time.


That’s kinda funny, as rapid fire is not remotely meta.


If only it was made by a not-shitty company.


>Cash shop armor and mount design that look much better than anything that can be earned in the game through reasonable effort (This is subjective)

At least at the moment the free armor looks far and away better than the cash armor.


All of that being true, all of that is completely optional. If someone falls victim to that, I consider it a "stupid tax". You 100% can completely enjoy the full content of the game, and not pay attention to any of that.


I hear they're in talks for a FF14 and FF16 collab, even.


To be fair, that’s his hallmark signature


Lol, I am 53


god damn you... take my angry upvote...


Oh, wow!


I am bolo SantoZEE of da REEpas


I played the Just Cause 2 demo SO much


Agreed. Overall, I still vastly enjoyed what I played, and the story has me hooked. I hope the performance is good, but I can live with the odd dip here and there.


There is no plan for a patch. 


Of course, this article is a month old and that could change.


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2023/05/22/a-day-one-patch-for-final-fantasy-16-is-not-currently-planned%3famp


Why would say one can tell they did their best when it’s largely unstable? What are those standards? Lol


The Lies of P demo was fire


Same, Rebirth is my most hyped game in a long, long time. Even more so than Elden Ring. I just cant wait to see if they pull of this super ambitious retelling of a classic story. 

Yeah its bizarre. Yoshi P and the 7R team has breathed new life into the franchise.


ff7r was fine. This is going to forego a lot of depth in the combat simply because you can only do so much while expecting the player to react in real-time to everything.


Yes I mean different from other FF games. How is it devolving? You can dislike the combat, that doesnt mean the series has "devolved". The tone for this game is dramatically different than other FFs and is way less, "traditional JRPG". No party, bigger focus on character and story.

Also the game is very, very polished (slight frame drop issues aside). Compare that to FF15 which was literally unfinished at release or FF13, how exactly is this going backwards?


It's kinda Nintendoland here.  There are hardcore gamers, but so many more like casual stuff like Animal Crossing.  Also PS5 consoles were prioritized for the US when they were scarce.


As far as I know, No.

Yoshi-p addressed it in regard to 15's story:

 "And you look back at the previous games, at FF15 - they had their story, but it wasn't complete. And then they try to make it complete, and then they promise some more story, but then they don't give us the story..."

Its safe to say that he is aware and tries to avoid 15's way of storytelling

edit:wording


>The real problem was, Kingsglaive wasn't included in the game as a playable Chapter 0. A two hour, linear "tutorial" experience that could have easily enhanced the overall experience.


That was my problems as well. I just didn't feel like putting it there since explaining my issues with the story would be making an essay on it. But I 100% agreed that it should had been apart of the beginning of the story to explain and setup everything. 

But then you get to the base game where you got missing context that had to be made up by the DLCs and the second part of the game falling flat due to it suddenly going linear.


It's true. The ending of the demo made me so uncomfortable in the best way.


FF14 was garbage at launch, but that was almost 13 years ago. The game has been highly praised since A Realm Reborn remade the whole game, which is coming up on its 10th anniversary!


Do y'all even like final fantasy lol


I'm not talking about just sales numbers, I'm talking about brand perception. It absolutely has been negative. Just because it's been slowly recovering *now* doesn't erase history. 10mil was absolutely sold on the basis of brand alone. People were willing to forgive XIII, it was a one off, right? Then XIV 1.0, launch XV and its mass media projects, and 7R is a remake of the most beloved entry in the franchise (also famously their hit in emergency button). There *has* been a major shift in how FF is regarded in the past to now.

I don't care about turn-based (action games are actually more my speed), have been a subbed XIV player for eight continuous years, and almost exclusively play JRPGs. XVI is my most anticipated games of the year. I want this game to do well. This is my lane and my community. But ignoring stuff that even Yoshida has acknowledged in [interviews](https://www.rpgsite.net/news/14244-the-key-to-final-fantasy-xvis-success-is-its-story-but-its-also-naoki-yoshidas-biggest-worry) is very disingenuous.

People have every right to wait and see.


Maybe I'm just easily amused lol. You're right on story pacing. It's a Nomura problem imo. And I say that as a crazy KH fan. Combat was disappointing in 15 for sure.

Also, what, you don't like Coleman camping gear?? /s


Hey that's my gf you're talking about bro. 

I'm with you! The opening and pacing were bad. And 16 does seem to have a more engaging story from what I've seen.

Cutting most of the Insomnia stuff was a terrible move in 15. The Versus trailers looked way better than what we ended up getting


Someone who has an early copy on the XVI sub confirmed the version on disc is 1.00. They briefly connected to PSN to see if any update was available, and there was not (which makes sense, still being a week out) 

I think people are reading too much into the “no day 1 patch” comments. Seems like there’ll at least be an update for disc players from 1.00 to 1.03, and we don’t know what that will cover yet - maybe it’s some performance tweaks, maybe a couple small bug fixes caught late, etc. But the point is that there won’t be a massive patch necessary for the game to even be playable.


I got dips as well mostly in town environments, not in battles, which is good. But I reminded myself that amazing games of the past were 30 or less and we're spoiled by 60 these days. The demo won me over with everything else so I'm looking past it and adjusting my expectations


Yup, the demo is entirely the opening flashback sequence.  No reason to delay on it.


Absolutely. There are two parts of the demo. The main story part you have to do first. It's mostly cutscenes and pretty straight forward stuff, but it's the prologue just meant to introduce you to the story and what the bulk of the game is going to be about, and you can pick up after the prologue in the main game when you get it. The second part is to focus on combat, it gives you abilities and stuff you want get till way later just so you can experience the new combat with more depth than the prologue will allow. It is set in what appears to be seen actual mission set slightly after the prologue and nothing from it saves. It does have cutscenes though, but got can skip through them if you want to avoid the story parts that are in that section.


It was definitely epic. I’m excited for more of the Eikon clashes because they said they all control very differently.


Yeah I really enjoyed it. Especially the way his attacks would sort of fake out your dodge/parry with a long animation.

I found the perfect dodge window itself quite forgiving though, while the parry felt a little inconsistent.


This is very true. D4 has a great foundation. Lets see how the expand the endgame and what they do with the monetization stuff.


D3 still only let you have 6 skills bound at a time. No different than D4. The difference is just the rate od unlock. You didnt get all basic attacks until level 18 for Wizard.


Im nowhere near the stuff that requires meta builds.


Lol good game made by shitty company =
Bad game?


But at the end of the day it's up to Yoshida.


Yeah it's been a meme for some time but the demo really is that meaty. The amount of content you get out of it is insane, and that's still just a fraction of what the full game has to offer.


Exactly it's turned into a twitch type game. I didn't like the combat in FF7R that much but at least the and in 14 there was some strategy. Here it's all button mashing. The best strategy was using every special move in order once you had everything unlocked. If you're looking for DPS why would you do anything else. Once to fix that it got repetitive as hell.

What pisses me off the most though is seeing these cool ass alternative baddies like Dragoons, Sorcerers, and Summoners that would have been awesome in a team game and knowing I'll never get to play with them. And I'm stuck with this same generic ass anime trope for the entire game. I even enjoyed playing as the little kid more than the main guy. Why couldn't I just control the other guys with me also? Why lose the whole party aspect.


I still don't think the DLCs filled any significant gaps. Not knowing what Gladio went to go do voluntarily on his own, nor what Prompto may have been up to after his involuntary leave didn't ruin the story for me. Stuff like that happens all the time. Ignis DLC is the only one that really provides something that could have used more of an explanation. Ardyn's, as well, actually. 

However, if they did continue with Season 2, I've always said it should have been a stand-alone game titled FFXVersus, given the nature of the story (and as a nice nod to Versus XIII fanatics). It would have given them room to "fix" the main/first game's shortcomings. I also assumed it would have allowed us to fully explore the second continent, given that the assets are there.


Hearing someone _actually_ say "fuck" in Final Fantasy, rather than just a bunch of symbols to hide the word, blew me away, even though I knew it was an M rated game.

Same with the woman calling that man a "cock" in the beginning. I just looked at my wife and went "Damn, Final Fantasy is all grown up."


It's fantastic game but I might have lost my account. The authentication system they have on PC is mindnumbingly cumbersome. It was a free account by I did have about 60 hours into ARR, and was going to buy the next expansion. Oh well


FF6 and 9 are my favorites. I've played them all on their original consoles. So I'm a pretty huge fan.


If we didn't like final fantasy we wouldn't have been so disappointed with 15

Great points in otherwise hyperbolic thread. The 7R series absolutely feels like “ICE” situation, but at the same time, many of the improvements and iterations of FF like the combat systems, graphics, UIs (and under the hood developments) seemed like SE experimenting with us, seeing what we liked and what we didn’t in our FF. 

FFXVI is VERY much giving me “this is everything you said you liked” energy


Unironically camping was one of the best parts of travelling imo, different strokes ig.


***This comment/post removed due to reddits fuckery with third party apps from 06/01/2023 through 06/30/2023. Good luck with your site when all the power users piss off***


Good game made by shitty company = "I don't care how good it is, I'm not supporting the shitty company"


Actually just finished the demo about the time you made this reply. Good stuff! I hope performance mode gets a little better. Good story, and I like the setting a lot. It was a great demo!


It's that Game of Thrones influence seeping in. Yoshi P had all the developers watch the show and they realized you can say naughty English language words and still be massively popular. Get ready for full frontal nudity, explicit sex scenes and gratuitous violence.


Not a lot of Japanese games say fuck


Eh, behind all the pretty graphics and lighthearted moment, FF series always have its mature undertone. Example: FF7 on ecoterroristq and mental illness 8 on child soldier, 10 with tragic world and sacrifice, 13 has branded slavery. It is just shown more explicitly in 16.


>	“Damn, Final Fantasy is all grown up.”

For me it was the decapitation literally right in front of the kid.

I immediately knew they are NOT pulling punches in this game and I am all for it.


Yeah, that's fair. Those games are fundamentally different from the newer ones for sure!


Final Fantasy does not mean turn-based RPG though. It has primarily been but has evolved over time, because a simple turn-based RPG like it used to be would not fly the same way.

Some neat innovations to both action and turn-based have come out of Final Fantasy (especially VII Remake doing this fun mash between them)


Haha I think the relationships with your party in 15 are awesome. Camping is a huge part of that. It's a journey. I could have used some generic chairs is all 😂


The camping was brilliant, and actually well-handled both thematically and in terms of gameplay... but yeah the product placement was just the worst.

(Except the Cup Noodles stuff. Goddamn that was funny as hell.)


I was referring to XIV's demo, perhaps you're talking about XVI's here? Either way both are phenomenal lol


Resident Evil has been dropping F-bombs non stop since 7


Yes, but that's my point. This isn't the undertone, this is the tone, in your face and non-stop. The themes have always been mature, but the overall tone was much lighter for the majority of past installments.


[deleted]


Yeah resident evil,metal gear,devil may cry,nier,persona (recently and only once) all say fuck


I have been saying this for a while now, but FF needs to make a sub series where it still holds the FF name but throws an additional word in there to set it apart (maybe FF legacy?). This series should be exactly the same as the main FF series but follow older standards like having 2d backgrounds again and return to classic turn based fighting. Not saying those things can't be improved upon either but considering how FF16 seems to officially abandon party's and any resemblance of turn based fighting I think it's time to give everyone what they want since going forward they will only drift further away and continue to try something new.

I am saying this as someone who will probably absolutely love 16, and don't mind the changes they make at all, but it is also sad to think that we will no longer get a classic style FF game anymore either.  It would be great to see an FF game that looked like octopath or the new game coming this summer sea of stars and by dividing the series into 2 paths I think it would be really cool to see what ideas they come up with for a modern day classic FF RPG. If Octopath is doing as well as it is I can only imagine how well this would sell.


I respect the hell out of your opinion! Mine is kind of the opposite. I prefer real time combat in general. 7R is my favorite. I did like 10, but anything before that just doesn't grip me.


What got me was the horizontal interactivity of it across so many systems, and how it went from tiny scale to ship-sized wakes. Holy shit.


River guy did awesome, honestly his talk was great.


Yeah this is awesome. 


River guy really needs to get us those rivers now. 

I want so bad.


I hope that cave with the ROCs in it and two entrances wasn't fake. 

I want multi-entrance caves so bad.

Then have rivers cutting in and out of terrain with branching caves off of it. 

Would be so fun to traverse and mine on the ground.


River guy absolutely nailed it, both with his presentation style and content. Really excited for this tech!


I wanna see this break with Lava rivers and have lava act like water and fwoosh up like that.


They absolutely nailed the first segment. Starengine looks AMAZING.


Will did a great presentation. He oozes excitement and was well spoken. And yes, the water simulation looks great and a huge improvement from the basic water SC currently has.


That new ship HUD looks neat too!


It's good but I still want to see water flow/waterfalls


CIG keeps making my jaw drop.


Star Citizin...The Way of Water confirmed.


The blur from the cockpit view actually look appealing


This actually goes an immensely long way in selling the weight and force of ships that currently makes them feel so unreal and immersion breaking, the way they seem to float static in atmosphere. Being able to see a visual representation of the power exerted keeping them aloft makes all the difference.


Now do the same with sand and dirt when ships take off or hover very low and I feel this will fix the impression that ships have no weight.

Real effect on your environment help ground the weight of the ships. This looks great.


Sex

Water sex


I want to fuck the water


i can hear my poor gtx1080 and old 4th gen i7 crying right now... And its only the video lmao


CR talked about wanting this at Citcon2017, and at the time I thought "great, more feature creep". But seeing it now, it looks awesome, and I rescind those words.


Its pretty, no argument here, but all I really care about with regards to water is WHEN CAN I START FISHING?!


I have a sudden urge to fly my Reclaimer over a lake in VTOL mode.


It looks so much better in this video than in their opening marketing video.


Really helps sell the power of the vertical thrusters as well. Very cool.


How does water go on the windshield when there's no water in front of the craft... I can understand if you're following someone but not if there's no one in front. Just sayin.


That Gladius kind of looks like its hovering... does this mean we're getting hover mode back?!?  I miss hover mode...


Terada will be ecstatic


Cool. Does the water still insta-splode ships?


They didn't mention anything about surviving touching water didn't they?


I can already see my fps melting.


Water guy had me smiling! Fantastic, charismatic and confident presentation!!


Thats nice and all  but we need better optimization so the game can run better.. you log into a server it won't look anything like that and get stuck in thev10 to 30s dips..


I don't give a fuck, fix the bugs


Fixtheservers Fixtheservers Fixtheservers


Time for a new PC.


When Pyro?


Can't wait to have that in 10 years.


This is very impressive!


water effects are nice but i'd LOVE to have playable frame rates with a 3060RTX.


As long as it is only in a promo video it means nothing.

It only counts when it is in the actual game.


Finally❤️


I can already smell the 30ks


but can we swim yet? I mean how cool would it be if we could drop our crew all geared up into the water to sneak up onto unsuspecting enemies


I was just thinking about seeing this in game yesterday, that's awesome


I'm probably just dumb but where tf in the verse even is this with lush forest and bodies of water?


Should have seen Twitch chat. It had lots of Nerek Smert, Refunds energy.

For every amazing thing shown you would get two dozen "**Scam Citizen**" "**Game will never release**" while we are literally looking at all the hard work they couldn't tell us about until it was all together and structured.

I was so annoyed that it was clear that nothing CIG could do would stop the Refund Andies from changing their NPC script.

"When will SQ42 release?"

After every presentation.


All the new eyecandy and audio effects looks sick ngl. God damn I really need to upgrade my pc lol.


eggplant emoji


Great, is it a functional game yet, or still just a grift?


This demo was so real.  I laughed when they said the water had object detection and the Gladius blew up with parts falling in with no effect.  You know that is a real demo for SC, already a bug :p.


Can't wait for that server stability and optimization demo.


That’s just amazing, so immersive!


Beautiful Any AI features?


This is really weak: they just put some sine waves with fake foam on top of a surface texture, instead of doing a fluid dynamics simulation. The effect is, that waves can't break, which looks really ridiculous when big ones approach shallow water.

Don't get me wrong, I know that proper water is damn hard! This is why I was so excited for the part. But it also disappointed me.


Oh fun more features only rigs worth 5K will be able to experience.


This is yet another tech demo that we will never actually see in game. They need to deliver on some serious tangible gameplay.


This how they impresse you with tech demos and then introduce 2 new ship for you to buy !


Every time I see one of these--a cool but entirely unnecessary visual upgrade--I can only think, Cool, but couldn't you have dedicated these resources to working on the core functionality required to get to release? I mean, just finish Sq42, and *then* fart around on the PU for as long as people will pay you.


[deleted]


[deleted]


Bleh I don't care lol. Where's the rest of the game.


Doesn't look like gameplay. Just looks like an animated shortfilm, so super sceptical. Looks like sandworm


Why don't they actually work on the core game mechanics instead of this fluff?


Wait what is citizen con again


Awesome, water effects that you’ll almost never see

So when we getting pyro?….


Cool. In any other game this exact water tech would be taken for granted because good water effects have been in games for over a decade.

Personally I love the water effects in Sea of Thieves.


Water effects is the last thing this project needs IMHO


Can't wait for my grandkids to play this 2078


1: This is a waste of dev time, space game, not water game.

2: This is not, unlike what the dev pretended on stage without mouse and keyboard, a live demonstration. This was prerecorded, so may be some weird custom client or wven a totally prerendered lie.

Don't trust the word of a liar, only trust things of theirs you can kick that don't fall over.


Thinking about the Futurama meme, will we see underwater travel with any ships? Will shields withstand the pressure?


Neat


Wonder how it handles multiple ships evenly spaced, and the ripple effect that creates when waves crash together.


If SC was a single player game I would have confidence of seeing this quite soon. Considering so much of this is dependent upon server health. Not so much. 

I hope Im wrong


Love to see it. TBH I'm here for fewer ships, more game tech.


Okay that is *ridiculous*


All that’s left is to recreate that one shot in Force Awakens.


Any direct feed yet? Does CGI typically upload not too long after? Looks amazing even in a stream, but i can't imagine in direct feed footage.


Is this halo?


Good job river guy! Solid preso.


I really wish the water moved a bit slower...  the speed of those waves kicked up makes the ship look smaller than it is.. just me?


Beautiful!


You know what's crazy, I have a couple hundred hours in the game and I don't think I have ever flown over water or even seen water in game.


This has to be my favourite!


sheesh


So if too many people fuck around with water shards will crash


You left out the best part about the water demo..... Where they drag the ball through the water. It was definitely the most impressive part


Neat


u/savevideo


Hell yeah. Money going in all the right places.


My body is ready


They spend all of their time on planetside eye candy... but what about space?


Seems like the dev team have their priorities upside down and backwards


I look forward to the CIG built water worlds especially Tangaroa with its 300m high waves which will be amazing to see, I hope some of our ships will be submersible.


Beautiful


The water sprays and interaction make this game look so dated. The engine is showing its age.


Is this with probably like 200 entities and on a standalone system and not being on a server?


I can hear my PC screaming in pain


What gpu/rig was this tech demo running on?


I wonder how it works on interaction with shores and if you could create a small tsunami is you crash a big ship close to shore.


Water Boy is a hero. The man is so passionate about his work and it shows in the product. Give the man a raise!


He did a really great job with his presentation. The best delivery of Citizencon 2023 so far.


River guy 🪱


Will "the wise".
I like this guy


Imagine the racing opportunity


I think will should be promoted to water guy from river guy.


River is in game. 1. 1 river


There is so much potential with more interesting terrain


He was excited af, and it's infectious 😬


He was the best presenter. Lots of passion and great energy.


His shirt really solidified him as the water guy, haha


[deleted]


Lava is incredibly heavy and viscous.

If you fell into lava, you would not sink.

So I think the best a ship would do is have trails of slightly hotter lava from breaking the thin cooler skin ontop of a flow.


Isn't lava heavier? If it behaved like water that would be scary.


Yiss


This suggests it's on the way, methinks.


i cannot find my jaw now.


Exactly. With these effects you can see and feel this force pillar that keeps ship floating.


This is a normal response to this footage.


Given the nature of this tech,   such interaction would create the appropriate waves and ripples based on the movements you are describing, and those would interact with other waves and ripples from other people performing such acts with water.  This is all facilitated by the wave propagation technique that utilizes GPU.

You're onto something here.


Even my 4090 struggles with the current patch (yes I know its mostly cpu bound)... so I'm curious how all of this will work.


My poor 1070 is just barely able to keep above 30 FPS on average since I upgraded from my old 4770k. I'm currently looking at new graphics cards because there's no way it can keep up for much longer. So many of the effects they've demonstrated were done on the GPU and mine is already running at 100%!


I've got the same thoughts.

A dev did make a cheeky comment about fishing in a thread on Spectrum when it was suggested that shooting and tractoring fish in the water could be fishing tier 0 -- he noted that he wanted proper fishing in the game and not to rely simply on combat.

So I'm sure if the community recognises the need for fishing, and the devs see fishing as a proper game loop, it's likely coming Soon™.


What lake? There no lakes after Reclaimer...


When you see the ships in third person the thrusters kick up water in a radius around gladius. Mav thrusters constantly go off even when correcting minor movements. Since the system is systemic you end up getting this result.


I'd imagine similarly to driving through a big puddle but replacing tires with downward thrusters.


I wouldn’t think on it to much, while water Prt of the presentation seems like a time machine back to 2003, taking about water physics like it’s a big deal.


There will be hovering mode for sure, but deeply reworked. Not that hell of a mess we had back in... when? But yeah, hovering mode is needed. Without it ships just flow in the air like an object without weight and physics.


Tbf, above a certain speed, hitting the water would be like hitting an asteroid even with a ship.


Currently SC is CPU dependent not GPU. You could have a 4080 and if you pair it with a shit cpu then it will run like shit. And before you tell me you have a giga mega ultra Intel 398947774k, if you are not getting good frame rates with a 3060ti you have a shit cpu/memory/M.2.


Pyro system


Microtech


The one in the video with the yellow grass is Pyro lll.

Also, Microtech has lush non-frozen areas [example ](https://youtu.be/3e2vXULXzvk?si=NpeaUhs0n_su4jm6)


Haters gonna hate.


Don't worry, you still have time :)


there will never be a demo for that


We'll know tomorrow, probably in the "Life in the first person" section.


They can break, and they literally demonstrated how they can be procedurally affected by intersecting waves and moving objects dynamically. It was demonstrated in the other video along with some of the Maelstrom effects.


I play SC just fine with a 1200$ comp. Yes you're IMac wont play it, deal with it.


Yeah, lets get the one person that works on the water that the engine will use to make entire planets based around water, and move him over to the network team. 

Big brain here.


The engine tech team only does this stuff, the core functionality for SQ42 is done. So they are working on making things look better, this stuff was made for SQ first.


>entirely unnecessary  

For the immersive space sim thing like these are vital. Otherwise it's not immersive.


Well, I can tell *someone* didn't actually watch the presentation today.


it's absolutely what you signed up for... it was literally just an idea 10 years ago... an idea that suggested it would be insanely massive and do things no other games would even consider trying.


You have Starfield. It's finished. They did it in eight years. If you want something that's finished just to be finished, Starfield is your game.

Otherwise, quality takes time.


Shit, I guess they forgot to tell the water tech guy, the only employee they have, to work on the game mechanics!


They let people play with pyro in person at citizencon. They said they'll start limited testing to some people Oct. 31 then ptu after that. So it could be released for everyone this year.


Nothing like this bud. This is an mmo game you know? NOTHING like this has ever been thought of. And lol for the sea of thieves water. Although pretty for what it is, It’s non dynamic.


I think SQ42 is in a state that it can be added now.


If you think cig is such a conspiracy, maybe the project isn't for you


Guess what's in space, everyone. Guess.

Planets? Right!

You know what's sometimes on these plants?

Water! That's right!

And do you also know what would be beneficial to have for your engine? A system for generating rivers, lakes, and oceans of water and other liquids?

Well, according to JoshuaSweetvale, no, you're a complete fucking moron. We should get the only dev that works exclusively on everything related to water, and move them over to the motion capture team, obviously.


There is plenty of it on Hurston and MicroTech!

racing in through cave! podracing


there are 20 rivers


The river they showed and the rivers we have are not the same rivers. 


Our rivers look like shit. 


Their river looked clean as fuck.


Unless 3.21 had river changes.


Ask him if he minds


Oh that's why I was saying it'll break. Because if I remember right they said the river tech would be essentially the same. So if they recolor instead of doing it 100% then it'll break and do that. But who knows what'll happen or if they'll have a different material. But it'd be funny to watch lava shoot out of a river behind you.


People always miss its liquid rock, even when it’s liquid it still has the density of rock,


Apply enough energy to most anything and it'll behave like water ;)


it fell through the planet surface


Weirdly mine runs better with settings on ultra than any other level


So why haven't any of the other recent sci-fi or space sim games done anything similar?


3.6.... but yeah, it gave weight to the ships and felt really good with dual sticks (when it didn't jank out and shoot you across the map into a building)


That's when the destruction engine kicks in and those "ctossbeams" break


Was more thinking if parking the 890 in water :D


fair comment - would AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor                 3.60 GHz with system having 32GB RAM be shit? i need to know pls because the perormance of ST is so jerky it makes playing a pain. nearly forgot - i have a pretty newish m2 1TB ssd as well.


I thought microtech was a snowy planet


I’m running i5 10400 + rtx 3070 with 32gb ram on ssd and the game is a low fps stutterfest even with nvidia ai upscaling.

Hud text is a blurred mess. 

Fell through the planet my first time trying a “mission” that’s still delivered through a mundane UI list.

But yeah - more atmospheric realism and ray tracing support is what we should be focused on.


I mean, whatever you have to tell yourself. Assuming that's even true, how much do you think this "one guy" get paid? $60K a year? At least? That's a fuck ton of pledges for water ripples, smart guy.


You know what else is not immersive?  Ships instantly exploding in water, walking on the bottom and being unable to swim.


Every CitizenCon is like this. 

"Here's a bunch of smaller presentations to show you guys how we build all sorts of things, and we'll do a big presentation at the end."

"wE DoNt CaRe AbOuT tHiS sTuFf!!1"


😂


It's not just one guy and you know it.


Did they show any live sq42 gameplay?


Pattern recognition.

Even a donkey doesn't trip over the same stone twice.


Funniest part is MicroTech is my main hub been using it for the last few years and still haven't explored it enough to find water lol


The rivers in the PTU are free. You can take them home. I have 20 rivers.


Would be cool to have lava rooster tails, if a tad unrealistic.


I'm pretty sure they'll do it based on materials weight and densities and viscosity instead of the easy way with bright red water


Gee I bet they never thought of that. /s


Into an ocean of beautiful water.


That's been a known issue for a while. Optimization is almost fully borked right now.


Idk, but it’s not a big deal, we’ve had super good water physics for 10 years at least.

Just a few of the 10’s of examples that pop up first thing if you google “water physics comparison”

And your point about “other sci fi or space sim games” is meaningless, are water physics limited to ONLY those genres? No there not.


You'll definitely get better overall performance from a newer generation of the Ryzen 5, but might be worth looking at a newer version of the Ryzen 7. Another thing to do is check your RAM frequency. There should be a recommended speed which you can change in BIOS and usually isn't set to as default by the manufacturer. My RAM for instance says on the box and all material that it runs at 3200 MHz, but when I checked it in BIOS it was running at 2400 MHz, so increased the speed and things have been better since.


Only 1/2 is showy. The poles are full of obsidian fields and the forest are near the equator. POI like Ghost Hollow are on microtech and that's in a dense forest


It's ok by the time the game releases for real you can afford to upgrade to the 20400 and rtx 10070 or whatever they will call it by then


 #1 that CPU is crap and its a sin that you paired it with a 3070. But even with the crap cpu you should not be seeing stuttering and low fps [outside of cities] with those stats. So obviously something else is wrong on your end. I run the game fairly stutter free with solid FPS with a 1080ti-5800X3D-32GB DDR4-M.2 and no blurry "text". Literally since the day I put Sc on a M.2 I have not fallen through a planet or elevator. When I had the game on a HDD or very standard old SATA SSD it would happen all the time.


It's not just water ripples, it's a byproduct of the technical engineering work he does behind the scenes.

This guy will be responsible for all future planet tech liquid effects, including lava, acid, and other liquids. 

Additionally, he's also designing spline tools for easy implementation and procedural placement of roads for ground vehicles using the architecture of his river tool, so convoys and ground-based cargo missions will be reliant on the tech he creates. 

He's also working with the planet tech team on planetary spawn points for more dynamically spawning POIs and mission locations that can happen anywhere across an entire planet's surface. He gets paid to do more than just make "water ripples".


This "entirely unnecessary" features will be there too. Don't worry.


It's one guy, you moron. He's the water guy. He loves water. He makes water. And he makes it well.


No shit?


They got 1300 people, they work on everything. Do you not know how a game gets made?


Not yet, everyone's guessing they'll have something tomorrow.


You claim we've had "super good water physics for 10 years at least", and then you link 2 videos of incredibly basic and lacklustre "physics", more often than not just using a flat, pre-made ripple decals. And the ones that *do* have 3D ripples and effects are mostly just premade animations, instead of dynamic water that interacts realistically with objects.

The only ones in the videos you linked that even come close to being on the level of this water demo are Metro: Exodus, and RDR2. But even then, it's a poor comparison. Star Citizen's water is on a whole other level.


Except these games are not doing fluid simulation. When you're incorporating water in games, you usually are working with 2d planes using normal maps and vertex displacement shaders faking the movement of waves, and projected textures for ripple effects, foam, etc. Sea of Thieves is different of course, but it still mesh displacement around the player, as far as I remember. 

What CIG is showing, is fluid simulation done in real time. There has been some work on it done in the past years, but afaik, no AAA game currently has it. You may correct me if there are any, of course.


Your Starfield and CP2077 video are not good at all. I would not say that's 'super good water physics', or even on par with CIG's water effects demo.


> And your point about “other sci fi or space sim games” is meaningless

Of course that matters. It means that no other game with the same scope and scale - from tiny puddles to enormous space ships larger than entire FPS levels - has a solution that looks good, is performant, and works at all scales. Unlike games like MSFS which pour in everything in making clouds look good, or Sea Of Thieves that does the same for water, CIG is trying to find a balance to do *all* of those things. That's the impressive part, and the 'secret sauce' behind why people care about Star Citizen. Yeah, people have done good water simulations. Yeah, they've done volumetric clouds. Yeah, they've done procedural planets. Yeah, they've done 6DOF dog fighting. Yeah, they've combined arms gameplay. But *all* of that together, in game, where it's seamless? No other company is even trying. 

No one here is claiming that Star Citizen is inventing water simulations, so your arrogant dismissal of it just because it's not completely novel makes no sense at all, especially considering that you think Starfield's water is 'super good'.


That's sick, I'll have to explore some more


1) Oh no my processor is crap! Ugh this crap runs literally everything I do just fine aside from trying to play star citizen!

2) Why did you number your reply if you only had one thing to say.

3) Relatively stutter free isn’t stutter free.

4) Star citizen’s community prides itself on hardware shaming instead of optimizing this dismal game. My specs fall well within the “recommended” hardware listed on the RSI site.


As part of the team that worked on that water... You're aware that it's not just a single guy's work, right?Also, none of us are paid 60k$. I wish we were.  
But we're a team focused on Planet Tech. Not everyone can work on the same thing at the same time, it'd be utter chaos. We're creating new tools and making the engine better, other teams use our work afterwards. That's how it's supposed to go.  
I mean, if you put us in charge of making S42, you'd be disappointed with the results


Cause I’m not gunna retype it, see my reply to the other guy about how reading comprehension is contextual and in no way were those videos meant to convey what I think is good water physics.

At no point do I say “look at these water physics there so much better” I’m not even trying to compare them to this game, just making a point that decent water physics are so old it’s not even a thing any game company talks about any more.


From what we've seen, SC is not full fluid simulation, it's just very effective height displacement, with impressive scaling based on input and camera distance.


I didn’t say starfield is good, that’s not what those videos were meant to convey AT ALL, you can tell by the fact my sentence after the links talks about “water physics comparisons” and nowhere in my post at all do I state or infer that I think those are examples of good water physics. Don’t worry about it though, reading comprehension is contextual and hard for some people to pick up, you’ll get there with practice and then stop putting words in peoples mouths because you can’t understand what you’re reading. 

And just lol at the fact you’re even trying to defend a company in 2023 for making a big point of having decent water physics, it’s pretty easy to tell you’re emotionally invested in the game and take criticism like a personal attack.


What other CPU intensive games do you play? You listed a shit 120$ cpu you paired with a $700 GPU. The only person here doing any shaming is you. You did the equivalent of opening up a window and tossing cash out of it.
 
Have you set SC or all you're games to run in performance mode in the nVidia control panel? Have you set your PC to run in Ultimate or Advanced power mode within windows? These are basic PC gaming tweaks that will help all gaming not just SC. If you are actually seeing consistent stuttering with those comp stats then yes, there is something wrong on the clients end. Could be under-clocked memory or not running in XMP mode. Old drivers or a old install of drivers that can negatively effects new ones. 90% of the time it's someone thinking they installed Sc onto a SSD only to find out it's on a HDD. Just because you have a computer that falls within the “recommended” hardware list does not mean there might not be problems. For instance, If its a pre-built then [most likely] its filled with bloatware running in the background.

 I could have just ran CP2077 without any tweaking to my system and it would have been "playable" but I took 10 minutes, made some adjustments within nvidia's control panel and got 20-30% more fps out of the game. You can do the same for SC or any game.


You're right. Sorry for not making it more plural when it comes to team efforts -- he's the face of the team, but it's a whole team working on different aspects of planet tech and I can't imagine how difficult it is trying to bring these features online since I don't know of any other games right now that have any similar tech to this scale.


> nowhere in my post at all do I state or infer that I think those are examples of good water physics

I mean you literally said "we’ve had super good water physics for 10 years at least" then linked a Starfield and Cyberpunk video immediately after. If you don't want people to infer from that, then you might want to rethink how you structure your comments.


> it’s pretty easy to tell you’re emotionally invested in the game and take criticism like a personal attack.

???? Buddy, you're frothing at the mouth and calling me an idiot because I asked you why no other space sim game is doing decent water physics. The only person 'emotionally invested' here is you. If you're so fragile that you can't handle a simple question without getting all emotional and defensive, then you really shouldn't be using Reddit.


Why yes I have - and I run cyberpunk just fine because that game has a devoted developer team that was focused on making their game playable to their audience - even after a failed launch. 😂


Again readin comprehension is contextual, the sentence after the links literally explains the reason FOR the links. If I used those as examples I woulda specified, “these are what I think are good water physics” and the structure of my comment is fine, as mentioned already the sentence after the links explains why they’re there, I just you know assume people will read the whole post, not get into the links and while there watching them go “reeeeeeeeeee this is what he thinks are good physics”

See man you’re just proving my point, I’m not “frothing at the mouth” you just think I am, because you read my post and assume my tone, and at no point did I call anyone an idiot.


Great game. I just played it for the 3rd time [twice before the 2.0 patch] and even with the 2.0 patch and the DLC I still get better more consistent fps with SC than in CP2077. My new 5800X3d has helped CP2077 a lot but the highs and lows are still to frequent and drastic. CP2077 is another CPU heavy game but lacks any form of networking which can contribute massively to overall performance.


Ahh yes please continue to flex how all of your impressive hardware and endless time to game has allowed you peak user experience. You should be so proud. 

For us the general public, we rely on optimization out of a developer to play our games since we don’t have the time to care about why our game sucks even though we fall within specifications. 

Your message to console gamers at launch must have been something along the lines of “YOU SHOULD GET A COMP SCI DEGREE AND BUILD YOUR OWN PC NOOB”


“ buy 2 “ I wonder how many times I’ve bought each halo title through my life…


Damn the nostalgia, idk how many times I've heard that spiel from Johnson as a kid.

Couldn't have picked a better level as a demo.


This brings me back, god miss the days of split screen coop and mp.


Fellow Halo trial gamers that played bloodgulch almost 24/7 where you at?


Buy 1, heck Buy 2.

&#x200B;

Me: Year is 2022: Owning Halo 1 xbox, Halo 1 CE Anv xbox, halo 1 CE PC, halo 1 CE anv PC from MCC

Did I do good sarge?


Wow he really knows what the gamers like


A fun side story when i was in high school i installed across the entire school every computer they had i installed the Halo Demo Edition. I put it on their server while i was helping one of their ITs with a computer. At the time (2010), they thought I was sweet and innocent, well, I decided to create a flash drive, and ensure that everyone that I knew, knew where to access the flash drive. Thus the Halo Underground scene began.

So what i would do is I would hold halo tournaments during my lunch breaks and after class. Play halo with a bunch of people lile teams of 12 and it was such a fucking blast. I remember what would happen is people got really competitive until one day a teacher angry slams the doors open from the cheering in the room (really great game of slayer going on) yells at us to leave as we are disrupting his class. So we did and that was the last time we played in that particular spot. Many more occurred after that haha


I played this demo countless times as a kid. I always longed for the day I could play "THE FULL VERSION OF HALO!"


The Silent Cartographer and Blood Gulch. You almost didn’t need to buy the full game. I might have put more hours into that demo than the actual game.


Wish we had more demos. Now we have early access games with no refund policies


🥹


I bought the game after playing this demo 3-4 times. This clip brings back a lot of memories


Favorite part is knowing the guy who shot the Ghost with the rocket got killed by that ghost


god i love this clip, heard it so many times before

my favorite detail is about how chief is about to die in about every clip they show of the full game here


Halo is the best. This video is the best


When you really break it down and think about where we're at 21 years later, Halo hasn't really improved much under 343; if anything it's regressed:

\- Split screen experience gone.

\- Co-op experience gone.

\- Campaign mission level variety gone.

\- Arguably weaker story element.

\- Less multiplayer maps.

\- Less multiplayer game modes.

\- Custom browser for multiplayer games gone, replaced with sweaty SBMM nobody likes.

\- Free colors gone. 

\- Hit detection and fundamental gameplay aspects are markedly worse than in 2001, 2004, or 2007.

It's hard to think what we really gained. Obviously there's armor kits and a store meant to monetize your cosmetics. There's some challenges and a frustrating progression system. And the graphics are better.

But holy crap this franchise has really not been innovating, and in many cases, has lost significant progress.


Loved the Halo CE demo. In the mid 2000s, there were pretty good Halo CE demo modding communities using Eschaton software. We would use the demo campaign map and port it to multiplayer and play around the whole damn map with multiple people. Good times.


There was 20x more heart and soul in just this video than Halo Infinite's entire campaign and multiplayer.

I miss how I was able to make my spartan red in Halo CE.


I used to beat it everyday during lunch in jr high


Interesting how that trailer shows someone using the fuel rod, which never made it into the finished version of the game (other than the non-usable fuel rods in the campaign)


SOOO, ya beat the Halo demo? Not bad soldier, not bad at all 🎖️. BUT ARE YOU READY TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP 🦶? With the FULL version of Halo (ding🔔). You'll find additional vehicles like tanks, plasma turrets, and aircraft ✈️. Powerful new human AND alien weapons 🔫. A single payer campaign spanning 🔟 massive indoor AND outdoor environments 🌄. Aaand support for intense multiplayer battles with up to sixteen of your friends! (Or enemies 😈.) All that wrapped up in an epic sci Fi story that's so FREAKY 😨, makes me SHAKE just thinking about it.

Halo: Combat Evolved. Buy one! Heck, buy two 🤑. 

That's an order soldier 🪖


So we can all agree that the ghost around the 31 second nark totally hut the player and killed him, right?


Ah sweet memory


Correction nine missions and a mental capacity test


Can we get the Johnson standalone game yet?!? I miss the guy….


I miss you sarge


I miss Halo Bungie much. 343 is garbage


Definitive proof graphics aren't everything, fun is everything.


Imagine paying full price for a game and actually getting the FULL GAME. Crazy right?


Good soldiers follow orders.


Golden era


I wish this was how Games got advertised now.


I love the retro infomercial music, glad the game didn't take itself too seriously!


So few people have seen this one. This is 100% childhood nostalgia. Also this is easily the most underrated halo add ever produced. I love this vid so much!


Damn... The good old days
Where games were complete at launch and the game was fun and focused more in vehicles


I miss the days of actual demos and not just scripted "gameplay reveals" and pre-orders.


Am man, I love Captain Keyes, they modeled the TV show guy exactly after him!


Now that's just plain good marketing


When games were still great


Wait what!!?? Fuel rod (sorta) was in halo ce somewhere?!


Ah yes I remember how Sargent Johnson had the skills to be a professional infomercial salesman 🤣🤣🤣


This was when gaming peaked


Ooooh was satisfying to make the 9.9k upvotes to 10k!!


I know this was for PC, but Xbox 360 was the prime generation of demos. Almost every game had a demo in the marketplace 🥲
     
....until Oblivion released horse armour, and microtransactions rewrote the game development brief.


I only played ce a few months ago for the very first time, because sadly i grew up with cod advanced warfare instead.


Is that ligit


WOW THE FUCKIN MEMORIES😭😭😭😭


God, I love it so much


Dear 343i:
Take notes.


The good old days: No desync and monetization, only trash talk and pizza party LAN nights.


God damn. Halo was better then. 343 fucked it for a decade and now Paramount is doing the same. ☹️


Almost brings a tear to my eyes...


*nostalgia hits like a truck*


Really wish we had Johnson in charge of the "academy" instead of *yawn inducing British lady*


Miss when halo was this good.


How did they pull off TEN (10) different environments in campaign 20 years ago, and Infinite only has one?


When games had personality


343 is killing the Halo franchise


Back in the day when the hype was actually lived up to. Damn I miss demos.


This looks so much more fun than any other game this year


I wanna go back so bad lol. What the hell happened to this franchise.


u/savevideo


hmm did i remember playing it on pc or im remember it poorly?


This is how you sell a game


Not bad soldier not bad at all.


I remember this. good times. man halo pc was great, btb on pc was so good. people actually tried to play the objective and didn't focus on there kd , can you imagine lol.


I love halo


Bungie 😩🥺😢😭


This is still the best demo for Halo to hype me up. Even to this day after the game came out.


Halo CE is the best!


I think about this bit often


As a matter of fact I actually bought two


Was gearbox involved in halo 1? Why are they advertised at the end after Bungie?


And now instead we have Spartan "good vibe" Agryna


I'd know that bulge anywhere wubby7


This is the first time I’ve ever heard this lol this was great!!


I’ve basically bought two of EACH game. I followed orders, sir


I had never seen this before thats awesome


I had completely forgot this existed. Thanks for the nostalgia.


I haven't seen this for nearly 15 years and I still remember this line for line.

I didn't buy 2 Johnson, I've bought 5 copies of Halo CE in the past 20 years


I was playing the Halo demo my freshman year in English, instead of doing whatever bullshit instead. Right as Sarge starts screaming, someone pulled the headphone jack. 

Worth it.


 TAKE ME BACK


o7


When Halo was a Starship Trooper spoof instead of evil Star Trek


Advertising done right.


used to play halo free trial at the library in elementary school…. i’ve seen this video so many times but not in like 15 years haha


Dude gaming was so nostalgic now it just feels like companies want to drain your wallet while simultaneously saying go fuck yourself.


Damnit, now I'm sad that Church died again :(


Damn I miss those days.  I'd always played Nintendo games growing up, but the period of 2001-04, it the wait for Halo 2, is what got me INTO gaming.


Lmao rip whoever was playing when they blew up the ghost


Damn. Didn't know Captain Keyes was in this too. Thought it was just the series.


Lol it's crazy I remember this. Man, early Xbox was a wild time. I had so many demos from the Xbox magazine


I like how they cut right before Chief got plastered by the ghost he just blew up.


Even watching this today, this game was so ahead of its time. It's crazy


I feel like game demos should be the industry standard rather than trailers. 

Games are an interactive medium it makes no sense why the vast majority of promotional material for AAA games are just trailers. It’s probably easier on the bottom line to slap a trailer together than a experience.

Also I get for multiplayer there’s free beta’s but at this point they’re just used as a soft launch and once the beta is up you have to pay for the game.


I never saw this before and I beat CE more times than I can count. Not on legendary though so I'm not a pro :/


Back when co-op wasn't a fucking event months from launch


Better action and CGI than the TV show.


Yes sir Mr. Johnson!


I have never seen this.


Which eye am I supposed to look at


...My Childhood...


This is straight up hilarious!!!


When I was in high school, some savvy kid installed this thing on every single computer in the CAD lab, and we'd all hop on and play as we finished our exercises for the day. Great times, and my first exposure to Halo as a series.


Used to play this every day in elementary school in my mom's classroom


I still play that game everyday (I took a 10 year break tbh) there is a good hispanic comunity still thriving.

Also it's the only Halo with the racing mode AND a server browser I think and that is all I care about


Take notes gen z. This is what in game ads use to look like.


Just finished watching the Halo show…this post really cheered me back up 👍.


Halo CE had a demo?


Me after finishing Infinites campaign...


My childhood. :')


Am I crazy, or could you not use the fuel rod cannon in multiplayer in the first Halo?


Back when halo was fun... Sigh...


Brought back memories of having the CE demo installed on the school computers and playing Blood Gulch over and over

Damn I feel old


Was this a real trailer


Loading this on a flash drive and playing it over lan during computer class, good times


I played this demo over and over

Have this whole speech burned in my brain


What song is playing in the background??


The nostalgia is strong with this one


When the Halo ce demo has more content than halo infinite:


Goddamn I haven’t seen this in years


This makes me want to buy it


Lol this brings me back when in high school, students put the Halo ce and MGS demos on to school machines lmao


I played the halo pc demo for like 3 years straight and my computer got viruses after like 1 month of playing the full version.

I used to love this ad


Peak <3


Still have the CE PC disc! Surprised I never wore it out.

I use to play on modded servers, CTF, knew most of the teleport spots and hiding spaces. The outside ring of Danger Canyon was prime, especially if there were a couple of Scorpions up there nailing noobs on the ground.


How can you play "with 16 of your friends" when the multiplayer only allowed a maximum of 16 players?


When you think back to how long ago this was, goddamn it was and still is so impressive for the time


BUY ONE

heck

BUY *TWO*


I miss the original fuel rod sound


what game was this demo on?


So that ghost definitely killed MC after being hit with that rocket right?


Holy hell, I forgot this video existed! Watched it every morning before primary school for a few months before I finally convinced my parents to buy it for me. So long ago now :(


I miss demos


Memory unlocked


So... you got detention.


Nostalgia, forgot all about this lmao


I heard that before unmuting it


HOW HAVE I MISSED THIS VIDEO MY WHOLE LIFE??!!


That's awesome.


Now that's good promotion.


*my wife


Can't tell you how many times I played this on my school's computer. Good times


Funny MS even said halo was a horror game 😞 I miss old halo


u/savevideo


u/savevideobot


I’ll take it over halo infinite


I'd rather play the demo of the first game over and over than ever watch another second of that dog shit excuse for a show.


Honestly.... this video is a prime example of what Halo has been missing ever since 343 took over. 343's Halo games have just been too serious all the time and this video reminded me of that. Bungie was always finding ways to lighten the mood in their games despite everything going on.


How did I never see this


This might actually be the most nostalgic thing in existence for me


I love the "buy one, heck buy two!"


I've had the "Buy one! Heck, buy two! That's an order, soldier!" line stuck in my head since 2003.


MY GOD I was like 10 years old. Why am I crying 😭


Halo peaked when Johnson dropped into FireFight


Oh wow. It took hearing that to remember how much I played that demo and multiplayer.


He really was the heart of halo.


This demo successfully got me into Halo.


This was better than anything Paramount+ has made


I was a PlayStation kid, so playing this demo over and over on my PC was my main way of experiencing the franchise. I'll always remember when I finally saved up enough to get the full physical copy from Best Buy and spend dozens of hours on the server browser.

I still have it and had used the PC key to unlock that ["Halo O" nameplate](https://www.snaver.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/halopc-product-key-enter.jpg) on Reach before [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) had transitioned to Destiny. I don't think I ever saw another person with it before the servers were shut down, so I assume it was one of the rarer ones.


bruh when I was 11-12 I pent so many hours just playing the free blood gulch matches on the halo demo.


Holy shit I still have that halo and it is still really fun to play


This is really fun! I haven’t seen this before!


Notice how a segment switches just before the plasma turret smashes into you? Should've kept that bit in.

"A sci-fi tale so freaky it makes me sick..." Foreshadowing!


Damn this game looks good. When does it release?


My childhood before I had the full game holy shit


Wait you guys got 10 maps on launch?? Cries in infinite


I miss the charm of Bungie


u/savevideo


This trailer is the best part of the cursed Randy version.


I love how purple the purple is actually


Before the Dark Times…


[Anybody remember this little gem?](https://youtu.be/fElUNYerY0w)


When do I finish the Halo Infinite demo?


wait, halo 1 had a demo?


Orders are orders.


I've got at least 3 Xbox copies of CE (for LAN parties). CE Anniversary, and MCC.  Greatest game ever made.


I have 4 copies of Halo 2 and 6 Xbox controllers, just in case I can ever make a LAN happen again


Above and beyond soldier


I legit bought 10 copies so we had enough CD keys to install the full version on as many school computers as possible and LAN party. I played that multiplayer everyday for 3 years in highschool. Good times.


When a game is good you end up buying it a second time. I bought it for the original Xbox and bought again the MasterChief Collection for Windows. if they remaster Halo games in the future with Unreal Engine 5 updated graphics I’ll likely buy them again.


I’ve never actually seen that before, pretty cool


I played this demo endlessly.  Brings me back.


Same, I watched it so many times. Couldn't afford the full game and my computer played the demo so shitty that everyone was the same color, but I fucking loved it.


Sad how we have no iconic characters or .... literally anything else from Infinite.


Same. Even after I bought the full game I would play the demo for the online so I could be a troll “not cheat, just team kill and mess around”, as there were no private dedicated servers so I couldn’t get banned… I was kind of a dick lol


What level was it?


Same, it came back to me like it was yesterday when seeing this!!!

I played this many times until I finally got the full game a few months later. Best video game experience ever.


No screen peeking!!


miss the days when halo had co-op and customization


My buddy would always host lan parties at his house and we would have to set up TVs different areas of the house to prevent screen checks lol..good times


Haha ya I remember


Seems like a lot of the audience for Halo Infinite are people who have been playing since Halo and want multiplayer single-player (co-op campaign). Instead they give us single-player multiplayer (Last Spartan Standing).


It’s a real shame how they messed up the lightning and the atmosphere in the anniversary edition.


I miss the days of days of proper Halo. 

343 showed promise with 4. And then 5 happened, not to mention Infinite.


Halo PC didn't have coop or splitsceen


Where whoever was match host got incredible ping and was basically a pistol God compared to every other player


Remember the limited mods you could get for the Demo? Nothing like the gamechanging stuff for Custom Edition, but still pretty cool.


Halo Demo with the basic mod tools kept me so entertained. Many hours of making the AR shoot rockets and fighting against my brother


I didn’t even care I had a crap PC, played on minimum quality where every player was grey and spammed mods on it with the tanks and loved online on dialup internet. My god the times


Those were the days.


Ohhh yeah. Even after I got the full version, I still only played blood gulch btb


Back in middle school I remember kids would download the demo onto the computers in the school's computer lab. I have no clue if the teachers didn't know, or just didn't care.


My graphics card was so bad that people who used active camo just glowed white.


'06-'08 checking in.


Here. Ah the great ol' Xfire days. spent my childhood on Trial, PC and CE. was probably in 15+ clans over that time lol. Miss it


Here!


my eMachines PC was so shitty every character on any team had white armor. I had to make sure the reticle turned red so I didnt teamkill. 

I still played the absolute shit out of that demo.


I'm still mad that there isn't a wide open BTB map in Halo Infinite.


Used to love playing the RAT servers.



One day when I was teaching my friend of this glorious game I found, I set up a server just to mess about in then it started getting populated.


Crazy thing was after couple weeks/months my server would be packed, even met one of my irl friends there before I met him irl.


Really strange as I only had vanilla server didn’t know how to mod like RAT servers but yeah my buddy entered my server with those cheats where we insta died and after awhile I rallied everyone to chuck nades before they die to deter the cheater away. It worked. 


Really weird to see when I go to a family’s friend and see a kid my age with scribbles all over his desk (found out later it was logins, websites, cheats etc.) spoke about what we play both play Halo CE trail, he loads it up and shows me mods and stuff he uses my mind is blown then I tell me about our mutual friend I was trying to get into the game and the server I set up that keeps getting populated. I tell him I go by the ign Assault Kid then he pauses and tells me he was the one cheating on my server the other day.


Such a unreal story to me even to this day that I met one of my buddies online before I met him irl.


My server was never a big one but it did have a decent community later on. - Assault Kid.


Reporting for duty


I feel acknowledged.


We had it installed on school computers for a time in middle school and oh baby we're those ever good times!


Right here haha. Downloaded it from a mad sketchy site and played for like 3 years until I bought the full game from a store. Which gave me a bad virus within a month.


Me.


How about swapping game type files in the numbered folders to get modes besides Slayer and CTF


I literally grew up there. I liked halo trial more than the actual game because you had to lead shots ahead of where they were moving. Met some good friends on there that I am friends with today.


My godddddd I'm glad there's so many of us.


Wow, did many other people have this "trial multiplayer epoch" in their gaming career? In my rotation circa 2001-2004:

- Halo: CE Bloodgulch
- Delta Force: Black Hawk Down
- Soldier of Fortune: Double Helix
- Battlefield 1942


Sgt Johnson: *Holding back tears.* You did more than good soldier... You know what the chief likes!


Thanks for the demo. *He* never gets me anything...

Weirdly, one of my schools the gaming tournaments were the only break the teachers had from the frankly ridiculous violence at said school. So they encouraged and helped with them.

Of course, our game at school was Icy Tower. Jesse was a fucking god at that game, no one could come close to him.


It’s crazy how many times this story played out in schools across the country (world?). In high school we had halo installed on all our engineering and business class computers hidden under a super convoluted file pathway but it was the same on every computer. Lots of great memories sneaking this or Minecraft online


you are an absolute hero. thank you.


In my senior year I too loaded the halo ce mp demo onto the server in our computer lab. We only played a few times and only ever had like a 6v6. I never thought I'd hear about someone else doing the same thing. You took this idea and cranked it up to 11. I applaud you sir.


Ahh man reminds me of my high school as well. Files on the network could easily be added by anyone so some of us found a discrete place to dump a bunch of games that we would all play at lunch.

Halo Demo
Liquid Wars
Morrowind
War craft 3
Battlefield
Counterstrike
Cave story


Good times.


Almost this exact same thing happened at my school, Cougar code or die!


I had the exact same thing at my school. I had played it so much at home, I always won slayer. People thought I cheated/botted. People would pick teachers' names and etc. - So fun and funny.


My school in 05 started implementing laptops for everyone. All the students had (what the school thought were fairly locked down) ThinkPads. 

No proxy needed to download stuff from the Microsoft site + free Halo (that actually installed and ran well) = the school’s network having hundreds of local Halo servers going all day long. 

Mod distribution via flash drives. Window Hide Tool (and you better be smart enough to turn off the icon too). Good times.


Have so many good stories about the secret halo matches we used to run in my school, also did quake.

Best times ever.

During graduation we were all suited up, drunk from drinking before going to school and we booted up halo one last time together. 

Never had a fancier deathmatch


i gave up buying early access games as they are always very thin on content and full of bugs. many are released in alpha state...

sure it funds the developers to keep working on a game but i miss the days when finished games were released in good time. no delays, no shifting release dates, no pre-order bullshit, no dlc, no locked features / content.

&#x200B;

just complete mother fucking game.

&#x200B;

when pre-order bonuses became crappy skins you knew the game would suck on release, if that's the only bonus they could give you. rather just have a game witout skins.


I mean, there's good early access releases.  And some games that are safe Pre orders. 

But they're not generic console games.


\>buying early acces games  
son, you are part of problem


Steam always lets you refund.


What was the demo exactly?


I thought that too, and where tf did they get a fuel rod cannon? I don't remember them being in the Xbox version


I just rewatched it to be sure, but there is only one single player clip where he is definitely about to die from the moving Ghost and maybe one multiplayer but that is more subjective.


The one I cringe at every time is "sweaty SBMM". Its such a meaningless buzz phrase used by folks who obviously never played in the wild west of gaming, getting obliterated match after match so quickly you can't even get your bearings.


I always remember people saying they brought the demo to school and would play it on the computers there, but I was always worried I'd get caught, so I never did it myself.


Haha me too. I played a lot with the Halo demo too.


Same. Someone got a hold of some admin accounts, so we'd install Halo, Counter Strike, etc. and play during study hall, lunch, or the unsupervised 30 minutes we had in our Computer Science class. Good times.


r/nocontext


Did they make it into the PC Port?

Also, to be fair, demos and trailers have always been made with assets from before the game is ready to ship. I know for the original StarCraft you can find so many teaser images of the game with vehicles and buildings that never made it in to the full game.


There's a typo in your transcription


Which one was the mental capacity test? Unless you mean Pillar of Autumn as a tutorial mission, I can think of a few that were less "missions" and more, "tests of patience."


Unique r/Halo opinion!


Yeah good old summer days with the Halo CE Blood Gulch! That jungle vibe...


Demo discs for both PC and OG Xbox would like to disagree, vehemently.

Sure, the range wasn't as great... but man, convincing your mother to get that fucking magazine was a whole feeling in itself.


It was actually a mandate that any game sold digitally (with the possible exception of Games on Demand since they were retail games that were later sold digitally) was required to have a demo. When you downloaded the demo it was actually the full version of the game, all data was downloaded, just without the activation key required to access all of the content. When you purchased a game all you did was download that activation key. This was to incentives purchases so that you didn't have to wait further for the full version. PSN did this as well.


I played all Halo's in December for the first time because I wasn't much of a gamer until a couple years back. One of my favorite pieces of the media of all time for sure and I am not talking only videogames :)


My condolences


Growing up with Halo was something else. But I imagine growing up with any decent shooter to play with friends for either co-op campaign and multiplayer would have roughly the same amount of fun?

it's the ending video for the demo version of CE which was available for PC so you're probably right


Gearbox was responsible with porting Combat Evolved to PC. They were also the company that screwed up the original code when porting to PC, that a lot of the graphical fidelity and awesomeness was lost, such as bumpmapping for textures such as walls, and certain interactive textures such as jackal shields changing colors when taking damage was lost. Sadly the original code XBOX code was lost due to them, so the only code for future combat evolved iterations, such as anniversary or MCC edition had to run on the PC ports code. 343 thankfully spent a lot of time fixing the code for MCC after the PC release, but it was many years after the fact.


Keyes was the Original Captain of the Pillar of Autumn in Halo CE


For PC yes

Good soldiers follow orders.


Anyone don't change the upvotes on this. Try to keep it on 117, please.


I'm not even sure how many copies of every halo through reach I bought, including extra Xboxs / 360s to do lans. We did em every Saturday... Sigh. I miss those days. 12-16 player halo lans every weekend was a blast. I'd love to make one happen again


MCC supports split-screen and LAN!

I put together an 8-person LAN party shortly before Covid, and was planning until until that happened.  I'm hoping to put together another sometime this year, hopefully with 16+ people.


Someone upload the sound test


Whenever I mention Halo around my dad he always jokingly quotes foehammer's lines "Did somebody order a warthog?" and "You know our motto. We deliver." It's like the only thing he knows about Halo. 

I replayed that checkpoint right after storming the beach, over and over, for hours; just sticking marines with plasma grenades and laughing at their reactions. He probably heard those lines hundreds of times. Wild to think back on now, but the game was just so insane compared to anything I ever played before at the time. I went from Lego island racing, to that. Played the demo for a month before I finally managed to save up enough allowance money to buy the full game.


for a demo it was pretty good, most game modes on blood gulch for free


Same dude I used to play the demo back in 2010-11 I used to play it a lot but I never got to experience the full game but the demo was amazing on its own. Yeah, sorry for this long reply but I agree with you it does bring back memories, have a good day or night.


[deleted]


Idk brohammer resonated well with me.


If Infinite's central combat loop wasnt absolute gas like it is, i'd probably consider Infinite the worst Halo campaign.


???


Y’all didn’t like the Mexican guy? What about not-Cortana?


I liked the campaign but that’s exactly what I felt was missing.


I’m curious too. I had the game since day 1

Edit: seems like it was The Silent Cartographer mission and the Blood Gulch map for multiplayer. Not bad


Everyone did it, some friends were just more blatant than others.


we are all guilty of this haha


For me and my friends it was called “screen surfing”


Back when the Halo games had a soul and weren’t simply trying to leech you for every cent unlike now


I miss the days when I was syked that Infinite was gonna have couch coop:(

Those bastards lied to us...


Halo CE didn’t have customization lol


> and customization

?

In CE you got to pick one of ~16 colors and that was it.


My buddy would host them in his living room and drag four couches into the middle facing outward at a tv. Prevented screen looking and we all got to talk smack. It helped that his living room was enormous. 

Man I miss those days.


ikr, i'm from Australia so most servers I had to lead shots like 5 - 10 meters lmao didn't mind though, got used to it and still had an absolute blast as a kid


This unlocks a buried memory.  I also remember having my mind blown when I got the full game installed and then tried THOSE mods.  Insane the stuff they had.  Halo 2 E3 map, drivable pelicans, HUGEASS(and the other big one with snow/mechs).


yeah I remember versions of bloodgulch where you would spawn on top of the cliffs and we had just had infinite ammo weapons, snipers rockets etc. It was insanely fun


Bro you could make pistols shoot scorpions, fly warthogs. What a fucking fun game.


It was pretty fun messing around with the mod tools. The shotguns firing rockets and all the wooden log bridges everywhere.


god custom edition was amazing. Spent so many hours on that busted ass Zelda map. I remember they reworked grenades into bombs and the warthog into Epona. Had a fire bow too


Beautiful


lol same here. I remember searching for why everyone was grey and being told my computer sucks. Didn't care, I played it religiously.


Yes dial up!!! Those were the days man, ngl though once I got adsl I felt like I was living in the future LOL


If your video card was bad enough, you could see active camouflage from a mile away, and people would call you out on it


Getting home, logging into xfire, seeing all your online mates you made from playing servers on halo trial waiting for you to join in. Checking your clan forum threads on their webpages as well to organise play times and practice for clan wars. Man those really were the days


Blood gulch and sidewinder were always our go-to levels


We did the same! In our IST class towards the end of term we would have a full lesson just playing halo. We would distribute the game using USB's, ofc we also played when we should not have with the quick alt tab where appropriate haha


Did exactly this. We got caught because our teacher could monitor how the lab's bandwidth was being used, and it was all just being sucked up by 12 simultaneous running copies of the halo demo 🤣


'07-'11 here, played until I finally managed to save up enough for a 360 mowing neighbours lawns


Same! Wouldn't hurt at all to have some sort of classic map pack with all the greats from over the years. It would be a true celebration of the halo franchise!


Yep I definitely remember the racing servers with the race game mode in warthogs


Oh yeah, Ventrilo FTW


Same! This is like a big get together reminiscing about past times. What's wild is that there is a good chance and at least some of us that saw this played together at some point as well


*343* never gets me anything!


When it was an old game I bought it no questions asked


I think most high schools had underground gamers groups i miss running them


At my school it was unreal tournament, for some reason I thought that was what every school secretly played lol.


I picked up the name RaptorJesus cause I thought it was fucking hilarious as a 16 year old.


Early access games will always be a gamble in a similar vein that venture capitalism is.

I think that early access releases for indie developers do more good than harm, it's a great way to get investment to fund the project further when you don't have a publisher. When I'm looking at an early-release indie game to buy, I check to see if the developer is active and engaged with the community, what their previous update schedule is like, whether they have a roadmap and how well so far they've stuck to those plans, and most importantly, whether I think I'll enjoy the game in the current state that it's in.

I still don't understand the studios and developers with publishers and external funding releasing early access. If a publisher feels that a game needs more funding via an early access release, that either smells of scummy business practices or things are not going well behind the scenes.


This is literally the truth here. If you don't like the idea of them, don't supports them, it's pretty not hard


If memory serves, and the location behind Johnson backs it up, the PC demo had the Silent Cartographer level for singleplayer and Blood Gulch for multiplayer.


PC version has extra goodies


Give me a break. I played Halo PC joining random servers getting wrecked as a newby mouse player game after game until I got the hang of things. 

SBMM has completely ruined my ability to play Halo with friends. I play on a high diamond low Onyx level, since I grew up with it. My buddies from work are Golds or Plats at best. They just consistently get wrecked, and I never get a meaningful game with them.


On the other end of the spectrum my friends and I figured out how to access the school's server and we dumped a bunch of games in a directory that we could access from the computer labs. Most of them would execute just fine without having to rip them locally. I remember playing Halo CE and the original Call of Duty during lunch in high school.


How could this happen to me…


Yeah both the fuel rod and the flamethrower were playable in multiplayer on the PC port, but not the Xbox. And I just noticed this is a trailer for the PC port, so that makes sense.


The library


OXM with demos was great too 🥲


If you had the internet in the 90s, you could download PC demos for most major games directly from the publisher's websites.


GameSpot I believe used to have a whole section of game demos.

It was a great way to know if the full game would play on your OC.


It was, but theres nothing to do with it now that cod has gone to shit


thanks


Gearbox also screwed up the Magnum. In the final release of CE, the game used a script at the beginning of every multiplayer map to buff the magnum, but as Gearbox was supposedly basing the port on an earlier version of CE's code, those scripts never made it in.

I do not know if the MCC ever fixed that.

Somehow I don’t think that’s it, but thanks for trying. I’ll check out the recommendation


I guess there is an Echo in the room


Stop it. The nostalgia. The feels.


Those are the two lines that stick with me the most, along with “They’ve locked the doors, and we don’t have enough firepower to get through them.”


At this point I would love a reboot of the series that’s more faithful to bungie’s original plans. The series fell apart as soon as they decided to not make the forerunners ancient humans and instead make them a separate species. The campaigns have spiraled out of control since then.


That’s a new way to cope that I haven’t heard before.


Would be but they hate Halo.


I dont even remember his name. Meanwhile I remembered Johnsons name forever after the first time I heard it.


I genuinely don't get how most of you guys liked him, he was so insufferable

You're with the guy who's saved humanity like 4 times *and you know that*, chill the fuck out


I think having a better story would've made him more memorable. Foegammer is a more iconic pilot


Even with the awesome combat loop, I still consider it the (looks at halo 4)... *second* worst halo campaign. Nothing about it really stuck with me and the environment and "levels" where prettymeh.


Sad how we have no iconic characters or .... literally anything else from Infinite.


I liked him. But the campaign story was lackluster and he didn't have much to do. Same with NewTana.


I just started it today and I’m not a fan of bubbly, overly-nice, new Cortana.


I honestly really enjoyed the game play. But I couldn't tell you what it resolved, setup, what the threat is, why any of this happened, etc. Also I think it was majorly lacking by not having any real big epic feeling moments which the other games had plenty of.


No, your friends just happened to go to your exact map spot in a very direct route despite being on the other side of the map /s


> Everyone did it

I didn't.


With me and my friends peeking is just part of the split screen experience.  If both parties are guilty then no one is lol.


Shhhh don’t say true things


It's all games now. No game studio is making a game without devising some way to monetize it to a disgusting degree.


> Back when the Halo games had a soul and weren’t simply trying to leech you for every cent unlike now

Just don't fucking spend it.  You don't have to.  It's digital hats.


At least you could pick your color and all were available in the beginning


at least they were all avaliable as another redditor said. And i didn't think of only CE as of writing that.


The other one was Coldsnap :D


Halo 2 E3 Map blew my god damn mind back in the day.


Flying the longsword into the enemy base and suicide nuking it


holy shit dude I totally forgot about xFire, that clicked so hard on my brain


Too bad 343 seems to hate anything to do with Bungie, so I wouldn't get my hopes up for any good ones.


Coagulation / WaterWorks / Containment would all work well as Infinite BTB maps. Specifically if Coagulation was more like the H2A remake that made the hills larger and added more cover around.


Totally.  We were fortunate in that we were allowed to operate mostly in the open.  My friends and I were the kids that did our homework while the teacher was teaching the lesson.  By the time they were done with their part, we had completed our assignments for the next day and were given license to do whatever we wanted.  That ended up being custom SWAT games in Halo 2, or Mario Kart on our Nintendo DS’es.


Yet here we are, playing a triple-A ''live service'' game that feels less finished than Star Citizen


The demo was awesome because coming from the Xbox version of multiplayer, the PC demo, and the full PC version, let you fly banshees on certain maps. Xbox multiplayer had no banshees if memory serves me right?


yup, that's it


> They just consistently get wrecked, and I never get a meaningful game with them.

I do find it interesting that this problem is somehow resolved by the removal of SBMM. I have to suppose that it's because you, being the Onyx, would get to be the one dealing that experience to the lower ranked opponents. 

I assure you, playing in those random PC servers (or hell even X-link lobbies) felt exactly the same as your buddies feel now.


Fair. That was definitely what came to mind as a "test of patience."


There is an Echo in the room


The one single time with those chicks that actually ended up being funny.


Dude!! And they didn't give you any information other than that. You just kinda gotta figure out what to do next. You drive around the island, go off a huge ramp and accidentally end up in the middle of 10 jackals. Once you kill them you discover a tiny crack, which leads up a narrow corridor into hunters.


I only learned recently that Bungie made the decision that humans were no longer forerunner between 2 and 3. Wouldn't have been much of a big deal had they not created "retcon the video game" also known as "reach."


Forerunners and Humans being separate species was already a thing since the H3 terminals and while it was kinda vague in H1 with them being possibly related I never thought that was the route Bungie was going with.


Bungie had no plans. 

They wanted to do ce and then go do something else.


[deleted]


That’s the thing.  That other species aren’t the Forerunners.  But that perfectly demonstrates the problem: 343 has created such a convoluted mess of a story that it doesn’t make any damn sense.


That's an interesting take since Bungie themselves decided the Forerunners weren't ancient humans, 343 just rolled with what they had. By the end of Halo 2 Bungie had already decided they weren't ancient human, the only reason it still eludes to that in the first two games is because they had already mostly finished the game by the time they made that decision, and even then there was never any hard evidence pointing to it so you can simply assume that any eluding to it was just a misinterpretation in universe.


Hate to burst the 343 hate boner but Bungie made that decision with Halo 3.


As /u/Aquillifer said, Bungie had planned for Humans to be separate from Forerunners since Halo 3. The in-game terminals + the legendary edition Bestiary clearly state this. It's really just 343's "YOU ARE FORERUNNER" line that confuses everyone on this.


Have you not read the halo 3 terminals lmao they’ve been planning for ancient humans and forerunners for ages


That would be because you hear Johnson's name multiple times, again and again and again. You only hear Esparza's name once, at the end, otherwise he is always referred to as Pilot or Echo-216. Same reason for why we all remember Foehammer/Echo-419, the name is repeated by other characters often. It's literally just repetition.


That's because we didn't learn it until the end of the damned game.


Because his name is Johnson.

It's an easier name to remember.


That’s cause he doesn’t have a name for 99.99% of the game lol


people only like him cus hes literally the only other friendly character chief interacts with outside of Cortana2.


He also knows what tends to happen to Master Chief's supporting forces. No chilling out for him.


???


Tbf, Sgt. Johnson would just turn up at points in the campaign and just shout stuff for a minute. He didn’t really flesh out until the books.


I found her kinda endearing. Like a little sister almost.


How did you know it was a direct route? Huh? HUH?!


Eh Fromsoft still seems to be in good graces for now


All AAA* games


Elden Ring would like a word...


This is one thing I don't understand about the NFT crowd. Oh you get to actually own the in game items? Great! Tell me more about how this isn't just another way to nickel and dime me. 

Remember when purchasable horse armor caused a fucking ruckus?

Good! I own those gun skins, now what can I do with them when the game shuts down and those become worthless? Store them in a digital wallet that gets passed from generation to generation in perpetuity?

My ancestors will be so proud of my gold ak47 skin with the word "ligma" on the stock. 

Pump and dump the stock market? No, time to Pn'D CoD!


You should look into indie games! They're keeping the spirit of gaming alive still


Nintendo, Fromsoftware, Id software, Naughty dogs, Santa monica studios, Capcom, Remedy entertainment.

AAA companies that deliver full games (altho outside of that some are questionable)

i saw you said you only meant AAA in another comment so i won't bother listing indie :p


That's just wrong, go away from big AAAs and more mainstream things and most games dont


Take a look at Deep Rock Galactic.


Hello games is doing alright. Cant believe the turn around they've had with NMS.


They are, they're just not big studios and they're not making big games


And they were only available in FFA. Yeh, the good ol’ days


Coldsnap war, extinction and the others mentioned in the thread were just pure fun honestly. The ai element in coldsnap war really breathed life into the map


I remember how those Warthogs could ZOOM


Coldsnap was THE SHIT. As I kid I was head over heels for that Longsword, and how fucking awesome it looked when destroyed.

Now Phantoms just get vaporized. Ironic really, now that we have the tech to do all the crazy stuff that game makers wanted to do in the 90s/00s, Studios just want to pump out lazy commercial crap.


Yep Xbox multiplayer had no covonent vehicles at all. PC also got the exclusive flamethrower and some exclusive maps,  as well as mod support for custom maps. PC was also the only platform with online play as Halo CE launched on Xbox prior to the launch of Xbox Live.


Yep


And dust


There’s early artwork from Halo 2 or 3 showing a forerunner tomb discovered by humans that was filled with human skeletons, so it was still an idea being thrown around for a long time.


I thought they wanted to make Halo 1-3, just not ODST/Reach?


How dare you disrespect odst and reach!


Halo 3 was where the split to make Forerunners their own ancient species happened, though.


Wait, what? Can you elaborate?? I’m genuinely curious


And the game is 20 years old, Halo Infinite is 6 months


So you’d think it would be impactful to people then. I don’t remember his name either lmao. Poorly written, annoying character.


I mean yeah thats definitely part of it, but he was also much more memorable than "whiny guy who flies the ship"


he clearly forgot mister cheef


Sad how we have no iconic characters or .... literally anything else from Infinite.


I do agree, he was fleshed out in the books, but he was iconic even without the books.


Maybe she’ll grow on me then.


Let's hope the rest of the industry takes note!

Narrator: They did not.


I see what you did there


Imo capcom has made a return to my short list of trusty game devs at this point as well. It was rough in the 2010s but they’ve been putting out bangers for a few years now


tbf the souls series is pretty much a single player game. Kinda hard to monetize single player.


Yes that's what I meant


Ya finally an exception arises and look how well it does. Unfortunately the game is universally praised for just about every other reason with no mention of the absence of paid DLC.

~~Nintendo is still pretty fair these days too.~~


I'm tired of people hyping up Elden Ring, the standards are pretty low now a days for a mid tier rpg to be the gold standard.


Irrelevant.  It's not multiplayer.


Eh, Nintendo started going down the route of "As a service" after Satoru Iwata died. I'll agree with anything before that being complete though. Seeing as several prior presidents saw games as toys to make people happy rather than rake in dosh.


Ya I shouldn't have spoken in absolutes.


I do actually watch the development of NMS with admiration. It's so much better now than the disaster it was at launch.


And the halo demo most people played CTF on blood gulch so it was RvB


This, but unironically.


Multiplayer maps did have ghosts on Xbox


I don't think you could use the fuel rod cannon shown in this clip on Xbox multiplayer either


That flamethrower was so OP.


I'm so glad MCC is fixing the visual bugs of the PC port so it can be the definitive Halo CE (alongside the community mods that bring the original Gearbox Port back to its full potential)


And the joke goes back to halo.


[deleted]


Nope. They were done with the franchise after 1. Wanted to make a new, different franchise next, and keep doing that.

They didn't really have any ideas, and Microsoft wanted a launch title (that would sell well), so Halo 2 it was.

Don't remember if Bungie wanted to make a new game in-between 2 and 3, might not. Earliest concepts for Destiny start here.

Then ODST and Reach are well known.


[deleted]


Yeah but it’s not obvious unless you’re diving more into the EU/terminal lore. In game, it’s just as vague as CE and 2.


Doesn't 343 Guilty Spark explicitly call you a forerunner in the last level?


I can, but first I have to admit that I was totally wrong.  The guy I replied to initially had it right.  The Didact and Librarian were, in fact, Forerunners.  They named humanity as their successors prior to activating the Halo array to wipe out the Flood, as I understand it.  They referred to Homo sapiens as “Reclaimers,” which I had simply assumed was what Guilty Spark was calling Chief alone.

But this further demonstrates my point.  The story has become a convoluted mess, largely due to the fact that 343 has relied on things outside of the games to fill in the gaps in the story.  Those of us who only know the games have been left confused and in the dark.


Lol why isn’t the campaign I’ve played once as memorable as the one I’ve played 20 times since I was a kid?


???


Because he was lifted from Sgt Apone in Aliens. Great tribute though.


>Nintendo is still pretty fair these days too.

That's rich


What do you mean finally?have you just never played a souls/Bourne game before?  Even the dlc they do release are full content expansions.


mid tier rpg is a very unpopular opinion but i have to agree with you on some points. most catacomb enemies are just reused bosses, gameplay is dark souls again. I do love the exploration, secrets and there is always somenthing to do in whichever direction you go and the game doesn't hold you

Also a good reason why it is praised so much as of now is because people are fed up getting delivered unfinished AAA games or games with 1000 microtransactions in them. So a game fully finished on release with no microtransactions is a breath of fresh air. That says alot about the current state of AAA games


It is not irrelevant to the comment I was replying to stating "It's all games now". Not to mention the fact that you can play multiplayer in Elden Ring as well...


yeah i forgot you need a subscription to play online, didn't occur to me atm.


Turn from the Dark Side, Sith.


I sometimes wonder if folks apply that same glee or hope to other....games..Like Halo Infinite and Cyberpunk...Like, hope that maybe the game will turn out better than at launch.   


Personally, I feel as if the type of games we saw in the late 90's and 2000's, are going the way of the dinosaur. Outliers, here and there, but from big name companies that should have the skill and resources to pump out great games...Yeah, its all about profit now.


Frick you're right. No banshees or wraiths though, yeah?


Maybe a design cop out too, designing cool humans is hard relative to making a cool freaking alien thing unbound by the humanoid form.


Nah Reach was masterful. Not like the other Halos, just amazing in its own ways.


Reach was… what now? How could you disrespect my boy Jorge’s sacrifice like that? I think you’ve gotta go play it again, that’s an order, soldier.


Agreed, I've never liked reach despite seemingly everyone else liking it. Halo 3 was the peak.


He calls you the child and inheritor of the Forerunners, and the sentence after that saying "you are Forerunner, but this ring is mine" seems to be more allegorical than literal. Halo 3's terminals are where all of the Librarian/Didact stuff started and where the human/forerunner split was formalized. Halo 4, for all its faults, was really conservative in how it added to the lore, it was mostly just drawing a straight line out from 3's terminals.


I’m pretty sure Halo 4 never even name-checks the Didact until Chief says “we need to stop the Didact”


Ah alright that’s the understanding I already had. I thought I missed some extra deep lore

Still wish that they kept forerunners as ancient humans tho


[deleted]


Yeah they keep pushing out games significantly worse than their predecessors, tied a unlocks in a fucking game known for being used in a local party setting to online, and release intentionally incomplete games as part of their business model.

They’ve gone really far downhill, most of the best games for the switch are Wii U ports. Which were not priced very fairly.


I guess they do have paid DLC in some games like Smash Brothers, Animal Crossing, and now MarioKart too, but I sure got my $60 out of Zelda: BotW.

Of course you could always view Nintendo's accessories and peripherals as egregious monetization also.


I don't really play those games. They always seemed like they did well but they were in a niche due to their difficulty.

Elden Ring seems like it's broken into mass appeal and that makes it more notable.


It's just sad, honestly. Growing up in the "golden" era with midnight releases and DLC actually containing dlc instead of just cosmetics, I miss the old times. I bought a series x because I was so hyped up for it and damn was it a let down. I'm still getting my money worth through other games but things just get worse and worse through the years. Games used to be an experience, now they're mostly just let downs with the occasional AAA gem


Not as far as I remember no. Wraiths were not pilotable at all until Halo2 -unless custom edition had them ? I'm not sure I've only really played the Xbox version


But then they made them look very similar to humans.


I can understand it a bit. 

Reach plays hell with the Canon in a bunch of ways by making Cortana a secret Forerunner super weapon that just met Chief, along with him being in stasis for the whole of Reach.

The rest should be solid though and doesn't mess with how the books painted it though.


[deleted]


The people who love reach probably grew up with Reach and weren’t really there for the heat of the H3 days. I’ll never forget launch night of H3. I was grounded but my dad took me to get H3 anyways and got me the legendary edition. I skipped school the next day to play it all day with him. That’s just one of many incredibly fond memories I have of H3. It was such a game changer and honestly defined my taste in video games entirely. Reach was fine I guess, but when our expectations were for the moon, you can’t help but be disappointed in anything less


Lol exactly.  Like, how the fuck did Chief even know the dude’s name, let alone his significance in the bigger picture?

Just let me pew pew some aliens, FFS.


Agreed.  Had vibes very similar to Mass Effect.  Everyone wants to feel like they fit into the bigger picture in some important way.  It’s a desire embedded deep in our psyches.  343 basically told us that we’re not special, but that we’re just the next in a long line of civilizations to expand, then collapse.


The fact that it’s spread across so many different types of media is the issue.  You can’t properly understand the story of the games without doing a deep dive in other mediums as well.  I’d much prefer that the games tell us everything we need to know, rather than having to pause mid-campaign to search out some clarification.


I can't remember for sure if custom edition had them. It's been a long long time. And even so with mods in the mix it'd be hard for me to say for certain.


IIRC Cortana wasn't *supposed* to be a Forerunner secret weapon in the game version of Reach either; it's just that whole scene was so poorly written (along with them never going into how AI were made in any of the Bungie games) that it left the impression that they meant Cortana was the Forerunner weapon, rather than simply being the means by which they found it.


I'm in the same boat. Everything in Reach's story felt fairly rushed and didn't give off some sense of confusion the Covenant actually brought to their attack on Reach. As an example: The opening level, once it's revealed Covenant are on the planet, it's so like...that's the response from the Spartans? That's it?

Wasn't a fan of the multiplayer either. I didn't like the direction of armor abilities, the maps being copy/paste sections of the campaign, and a few other things.

Something about it didn't feel like it had that Bungie "polish" to it, which is funny because Halos 1-3 were incredibly tight on time but came out great.


There are games that have since outsold Halo 3, but I  can't recall any other games having the buzz that it did. The entire male population of my school was completely useless the day after release, none of us wanted to be in school, even more than usual.


LMAO. "I was 15 when the 3rd game came out, not like these kids who started with the 4th game"

Most of us that were actually around for CE can appreciate the good parts of each of the bungie games. 3 was great, but it's not the be-all end-all of the HALO experience.

Imagine finding the cold dead corpse of your friend, you stand there in horror as the remainder of your group tries to figure out why, and how he died. then. one of your friends, simple says "it was me". you feel your heart sink. your face goes numb as your brain recognises the voice of Tavish. a man youve know for years. you hear the shaken gasps of the rest of your group as he pulls out a gun. then the final words you hear as he levels it to your head, are "i dId it lIkE tHis"

Yeah as a kid whose family didn't have much money for games I'd replay these demos all day. Now I buy games and never have time to play them lol.


Then you should watch the Fun Haus series, Demo Disc, on YouTube.


I miss demos in general. We live in an age where we can download them easily, yet they are mostly dead.


Why is this NSFW?


I miss instruction booklets that used to come with games. They always had a need little "notes" section at the back that was pretty much exclusively used to write down cheats. Good times.


Oh yeah, I sure do miss those days😢 I remember when our PSX had came with a one demo desk filled with different kinds of games and a few secret ones too


Hell yeah


One of my best gaming memories (apart from playing CS with friends from school) was playing Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 DEMO...I played one level, over and over and over and over again.

&#x200B;

I just got THPS1+2 (as a middle aged adult) and it always brings me back to my childhood...I just suck a lot more at the game


Doom 3 was great! FMIRL


Used to work at a bookstore with a massive magazine section. I was one of the back room people and we’d split up the remaining demo discs after we’d sent back the magazines. Returns department crew would take the games demo discs, I would take the music discs.


Splinter Cell chaos theory. Man I miss the old days…


I miss full games. In my country there was magazine CD-ACTION that was adding 2-4 full games every month. Since 1996 to 2020. It was costing round 4,5 dollar for 150 pages + games. Now it bankrupted cause covid and internet


Those Amiga magazines were a gamechanger. I was about 9 when I got a floppy disk with OctaMED tracker software from a CUAmiga magazine. Made a boring childhood more interesting when I learned to make complete songs with a goddamn computer.


Check out the show Demo Disk by Funhaus onYouTube


Funhaus has a popular youtube series called DEMO DISK. So many gold moments.


Never mind discs, I remember when it was tapes.


Yeah, same here. Back in the 90s getting a copy of PC Gamer with the demo CD. Good times.


Except 67.4% were stolen


Who remembers those Pizza Hut demo disks?! Aah, Final Fantasy 8 demo FTW!


Wow, Aus OXM didn't bother with the labels. US OXM had images on the disc like they were an actual retail game disc.

&#x200B;

Also later OXM's hid some demos in them, I remember the Japan-language-only Phantom Dust demo coming in one which garnered enough interest for Majestco to get the license from MS to publish in the US.


I miss demos as a whole. Only few games have demos nowadays. As a kid, I loved downloading dozens of demos, in order to find the perfect game


Area 51 was an underrated gem!


I remember whenever I got one that allowed online play. 

Free fun for hours.


The folders with the funny videos :)


Now they make no sense, because all this can be found on the net.

But this had its own charm. I still keep a stack of these magazines, although I don't think I'll ever read them again.


I grew up in a family that wont priorityse buying games as entertainment because of lack of money,so for 4 years my only game would be NFS Hot Pursuit 2 and demos,loads of Demos.


I remember the Demo that I most played was Getaway,that Demo would finish just if you wanted,by completing the main quest,it was kind of a GTA but from a Police perspective(the Demo).


My favourite one was not that one anyway,it was Urban Reign,best Fighting game in that moment IMO.

Right now as I get my own money I cant stop buying games and barelly playing them...sad,but one day my future kids will have thousands of hours of games😂😂


There's only 3 games/series on both lists/covers that are still relevant today. It's sad

Doom 3 - Doom Eternal

Flatout - Wreckfest

Battlefield 2:MC - BF:2\*42


The nostalgia here... my friend and I would get together and listen to his Limp Bizkit CD and take turns trying to get the best runs on skateboarding demos.


I miss magazine


What happened to the effort that was put into developing games? Now they just try and pump em out as fast as they can come up with them. Of course not all developers are quilts of this but many titles are getting released unfinished.


I miss the old cheat books and game guides


I am so glad I have kept almost all of mine. Two of those huge binder carrions with in each at least 80 discs. Sometimes I browse them just for the memories.


Holy shit unreal championship 2. I completely forgot that existed. They tried to emphasis melee combat and it fell so flat!


Me 2


Those look Frighteningly similar to the Playstation 2 Magazine Demos!


I still remember buying the magazines to get my hands on a demo disk when I had finished the one game I got every 3-4 months ( half of which where most definitely bootlegs cause 
well original copies were only available for very few titles in my hometown . ) .


I remember being very excited every time i got a magazine with a demo disc in the 90s and 00s (the 2 big ones were called Level And Chip in Romania).


I just watched a video on YouTube talking about exactly this. They were ingenious imo


Me too buddy


This really was an amazing concept. I played these demos a lot. The magazines I read also came with a small description of each game. You only had limited space on your harddisk so you couldn’t just install anything.


omg I still have the one with the original lego star wars and destroy all humans demo. I think it even has one of the burnouts on it. and dbz sagas


I played that Republic Commando demo so much. It got me so hyped for the game.


The best demo disc ever came with a demo of both Wipeout and this other game called DeathDrome where you and other prisoners were forced to compete on Tron-like vehicles to kill each other, find some keys and escape an obstalce- and trap-laden arena. The CD had the music for Wipeout encoded as 7 or 8 CDA tracks, and when you played the DeathDrome demo it started playing these Wipeout tracks from the CD. The music accompanied the game perfectly. We never played the Wipeout demo nor could I ever acquire the full game of DeathDrome. I should Google that rn...

I don't miss PC demo discs from before steam was a thing, They didn't work like 50% of the time cause the folder structure was wrong or you were missing some file. Fixable now but as a kid with no internet and little knowledge of PC's, it sucked.


Yay cluttered


Doom 3 on og xbox is a technical masterpiece.
The normal mapping seen on xbox was mind blowing.


I watched "The Games That Made Us" on Netflix, the episode about DOOM and I was instantly nostalgic about shareware. Kids today will never know the joy of getting just asnippet of a game and really, really wanting to play the rest of the game.


Digital Foundry just did on video on these!


Oh man I really miss Splinter Cell.


Caddicarus did a whole half hour video about Playstation demo discs.


Demos and betas should be standard for games.


I have a hacked Xbox and it has all of these demo discs compiled


Always wanted the full area 51 game. Replayed it constantly.


Yes I remember these demo, great value....


Chaos Theory's demo was so sick! It was the level where you started in the cave. I remember playing through that shit every possible way.


McDonald's used to have them too with their Happy Meals!
Played the Zapper demodisc a million times on my pc lol


Cool


I have a bunch if anyone is interested


R.I.P. to the C.D.


They were a athink before the Internet. I stopped buying Magazines with Demo Discs when I got Internet in 2003.


pizza demos


DMC 1 on demodisc was our go to on PS2 demo, on PCGamer demodisc we had Postal 2 which was the most brutal game we had ever seen, and a FEAR demo that was as SP00KY as it was CPU / GPU melting.


Dang, Chaos Theory is still fire. 👌


exited


Every game I bought from age 15-20 I had a demo of first.


*Tweaker intensifies*


me too


The save files on these disks were great. My favorite game of all time, KOTOR, that's Knights of the old Republic to you non-Star Wars folks; the only DLC for this game was available by disk after the server shut down. It is impossible to find unless you're playing on PC now. It was great. Orange lightsaber was badass.


Digital Foundry took a look at an old xbox demo disc the other day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP2q0P9Oo8g

Giant Bomb has also videos on a lot of demo discs, but they are paywalled https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/demo-derby/


Anyone else still do the chaos theory whistle?


I bought that Xbox magazine with my OG Xbox to play the splinter cell demo. It’s what got me into Xbox back in the day. Memories.


Far out you just unlocked a very deep memory


Dang splinter cell was the shit


It's a good memory, but I like being able to download my demos (the legal kind) from steam or the puslisher/developer site when they're available and not have to buy massively overpriced magazines with optical discs.


They had many useful tools too, back then it was hard to found about those things.


Why don't games release demos anymore?


For sure I played the shit outta the Tony Hawk demo disc.


Chaos Theory best game ever.


Man, I lost count how many times I replayed Max Payne 1 and Unreal II demos.


Same. I never bought them myself, but as a kid I remember a friend of the family would always give us the discs he got from those kinds of magazines. We still have a "Demo One" PlayStation demo disc, with Medievil, Demolition Derby and Ball Breakers. Can't tell you how many times I played those demos...

I'm really bummed that we lost all the PC demo discs  though. There were so many games I've forgotten the names of that I'm pretty sure don't even exist anymore. Or if they do, they're probably incredibly hard to come by.

**Edit** - on the off chance anyone remembers, the games I really want to find:

* Some maze game where you rolled around as an egg, which had some really obnoxious stock sound effects.

* One disc had a game that I've now found out is called Slay (a new version called Antiyoy was made by someone else) - but the other game from that disc I really wanted to find again was called Goo... I think. 😅 Goo was just a simple, pretty awkward 2D platformer where you played as a Slime jumping through an area filled with toxic waste.

* Lastly... I don't even know if this was on a demo disc (in fact I'm almost certain it was just a free Internet game), but it was a 2D game where you flew a space ship (triangular shaped I think) through a top down set of... Caves I guess? You had to be careful with momentum since you'd lose a life if you hit any walls, but you had to find coloured keys to open gates, and find & get to the exit.

All either silly, or just really tricky games, but I'd really like to find them again for nostalgia's sake.


It was like getting a gift with the game!


One of my favorite YouTube series was funhaus's demo disk where people sent them old demo disks that they tried to play through


Apparently demos were an amazing way to kill sales so companies stopped doing them. God forbid you actually find out it was an unfinished pile of shit before paying £70 for the pre-order.


MY MAN, YOU JUST HELPED ME REMEMBER WHAT WAS "that cool game where you are a cool tech ninja where you kill people quitely" I have given this description to my dad when I was 8 or 9 since I didnt know how to crack or download games for free at that time, my dad was the only one who did the tech related things in our household, thank you SO much, this has to be on the internet right?


Huh, neat. I think they're a rarity nowadays.


Oh my god, me too. I grew up reading Nintendo Power and once I was old enough to subscribe myself it was Electronic Gaming Monthly. Sigh. I’ll always be that old “physical media was better!” guy but I also secretly buy too many games digitally…


I had one that had a Tony hawk knockoff for a BMX game and splinter cell on it, the BMX game was pretty fun but the splinter cell demo was like the second tonlast level in the game and the game was nothing like the demo other than layout of the level. It was fun though.


Streamable demos are on the rise. Hopefully you'll be able to try most games before you buy with streaming in the next decade. It already exists and Sony is pushing it.


I miss demos, period. The industry figured out they don't need to bother since- "You'll probably preorder it anyway"

Armored Core, God of War, Just Cause 2, Prey, Crackdown, Freedom Planet, Monster Hunter Rise, Final Fantasy 8 (Ok, the demo was more interesting than the game), Deep Rock Galactic (Free weekend vs actual demo), 

Ton of games I found via demos that I might not have tried. Now they just rely on millions of dollars into marketing and hype- or don't bother and call the game a failure after. 

Demo discs were great, especially when poor as hell. I got my PS1 and FFVII- and for months that's the only game we had on it. So we rolled with the demo disc that had Armored Core, Treasures of the Deep, Porche Challenge, Parappa the Rapper till we got RE1 and 2 eventually


Why is there a spoiler warning?


I LOVE the use of capitals in the copy.


As a kid I loved demo discs, when I couldn't afford many games. But I'm lucky enough that I can pretty much buy whatever game I like the look of these days, so the need for demos has gone.


I'm old enough to remember getting demo's for my Mega-cd.

1 month they had a demo for Keio flying squadron. In the rush to publish the demo they accidentally gave away the full game, all you needed to do was press a few buttons at the right time to unlock it.


Yeah but now we have Gamepass and don't need to pine over demos for games we couldn't afford as kids.


\*What I think kids these days would say\*  -  What's a demo?  
\*Actually what kids these days would say\*  -  What's a magazine?


If you want to feel old, tell a kid that you used to have to mail back the Netflix DVDs and wait for the next one to arrive in the mail


Not old enough to experience this, but my cousin told me that they used to give pages of code in magazines that you could manually copy into your computer to play the game they were giving out.


[deleted]


Reasons devs/publishers have killed off the demo disc/downloadable demo: "It costs too much money time and resources" - "Sometimes we just put the whole game on the disc and people find away around the demo time limit" 

Or if you ask me their #1 reason "People would find out this game is absolute trash and wouldnt buy or preorder"


What? You mean let people play a fragment of the game for f-f-f-f-FREE!? Don't be ridiculous! Now help me split these physical extras and DLC apart so that people need to buy the game at least three times to get everything!


Ah the memories, I still own that one demo disc with Doom 3. I wish my Xbox would still work


Chaos Theory is such a timeless classic


those were a thing in my country i remember that there was a french mag that specialize in video games around each month or two weeks and each number published came with a free game or a demo , i remember i put my hand few years ago on unused issue in a pawn shop with an old game called second sight


I love the menu theme on Jam Pack Volume 11. It has no business slapping that hard


[We can be friends if you rocked out to this menu as a kid like me](https://youtu.be/-SwQr1Xsg9E)


I had that exact one with chaos theory. If I remember right magazine had like a 6 page story on it well frothing over how good the lighting was lol


What is that weird round thing on the right? ... 😂


Yeah I miss cover tapes...fuck I am old...


yeah it was such such a fun :)


Try just Demo's in general, they are almost non-existent today. (At least on PC)


I miss demos from pizza


Good old times


But how many games have demos these days?

But You have faster internet connection to download things than putting disc to reader.


If you guys miss demos, then stop pre-ordering and day-1-buying games that aren't even close to being finished. The only way you have a say in this, is money. The only language corporations understand.


I remember a demo for Warcraft, Orcs and Humans we had that was literally half the game. Got it with win 95 I think


So the ps1 demo disk for a game called spider was what made me purchase the game... As a form of advertisement, it worked and I don't feel manipulated or conned by it, I feel like they were saying "try our game, we think it's good"


Me too, especially the one from BK that was a good game.


I had a PS1 demo disc that had G-Police and Man Overboard, as well as a few others I was too young to remember. Played it non-stop.


This was the greatest feature of the Xbox magazine


Man I had the demo to the original ps1 crash bandicoot I remember me an my sister constantly replaying that first level


My PS-ONE when I got tired of the game that came with it I played the demo disc to hell.


JamPack for PlayStation was the best


Those were the days when you didn't need a hotshot graphics card of hundreds of dollars to play (and enjoy) a game on PC. You play a demo and decide if the game is worth buy and then beat the shyt out of it.


I still have a couple in a case with a bunch of old music CDs and original games. 

One of them is full of custom Doom maps. Like 100 of them or more. A real nostalgia trip.


oh man dead to rights 2 is on there

what a fucking fun game that was


There also were for Xbox? I thought it was a PC only thing.


As a kid who wasnt allowed to play games which were to violent. Demo Discs were the key to play them. I cant tell you how long Ive played this demo of splinter cell Chaos theory and wanted to play the whole game so bad.


i got a super bad virus from a tomb raider demo back in the day.


How many good Demos are on these disks? Zero. A waste of plastic.


This is a core memory moment


I miss demos in general. But hey last time I made a post about it I get downvoted to oblivion and people just troll me saying there's "thousands" of demos you can download, meanwhile could never tell me how to access the "thousands" of demos since I can only find maybe a hundred.


Ah this is how I got into so many games, spyhon filter being one of them


Demos back in the days were really good. I remember playing the duke nukem 3d demo for years. It was the whole first chapter which was like a full game nowadays :)


I remember one from the late 90's. It had "Coconut Monkey" as a mascot of sorts. WIsh I still had those, they were great corny fun.


i dont, they always gave shit games and tons of shit demos, but I miss the magazines themselves, some of them had good writing


Dad used to get those for us growing up.
I loved playing the Halo demo. The silent cartographer is the only Halo mission I can name because of that demo disc.


Exactly!!! This is the little stuff I miss along with cool pizza deal combos... I would get stuff from little foam baseball and bat to a DVD...  and just better toys in happymeals.


Demos were so cracked


The best demo disc I remember was Psy-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy. I must have played that for 50 hours or more.


I would use these primarily to find new monsters in monster rancher for the PS1


I think Jakey's ode to Pizza Hut PS1 demo discs may tickle the fancy of a lot of people here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zf-QfChz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zf-QfChz8)


I had one with a demo of Threads of Fate that I'd play pretty often. Always had fun playing it.

Two console generations later I finally bought a digital copy of the game. I only made it about twice as far as where the demo ended before I got bored and moved on to another game.


We're relics of a different time.


i miss strategy guides and manuals as well


I have core memories of getting a new Jampack at Target whenever they would come out (I think they were quarterly with one for each season?)

Playing the original demo for Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper… those were the days.


me too


Hello! I am Coconut Monkey! Have you heard about our new game, Gravy Trader?


This reminded me of an old memory. I bought a Playstation magazine years ago. It came with a demo disk for Killzone (the first one) before it was released. Immediately got hooked on the game. I played that demo so many times, I knew then and there I was buying that game on release. since then I have day 1 bought every killzone game on its release day. The early 2000s were great 👍


This gives me PTSD.


I have about thirty of these and will never let them go. A surprising amount of games convinced me due to demos, and they are wholly responsible for me loving rally racing now.


I used to love when you would explore the demo disc and find more demos.


Did you see DF's recent video on an OG Xbox demo disc? Their content is always a joy to watch.


Yo I totally forgot about these. Thanks for sharing.


Does anyone miss the official xbox magazine disks that had the hidden secrets? Press buttons on menu, figure out pattern, get secret demo's/videos


I miss the game demos that Pizza Hut use to give out at one time as well.


These discs were how I updated my Xbox 360 when I lived 70 miles from the nearest location that would have broadband 😆


My favs were Mac Addict magazines. 
Full of dumb system sounds, themes. Game demos. Staff videos. Icon packs. Software etc. Lovely.


I got heaps of them still from the Xbox magazine. Good times.


My brothers and i played the Silent Cartographer mission of Halo:CE from a demo disk given to us by a friend for months before finally convincing our dad to buy the full game. We knew that island better than our own backyard.


Bro I lived by these demo discs ! All the fun times, some even had secret Easter egg games hidden within.


The memories


The PS1 ones were my jam. I was so young I could find entertainment in playing that Jumping Flash! demo over and over again.


wait... There's a Constantine game?


I found the Yakuza series from a demo disc, thank fuck for that lol.


Fusion frenzy was awesome never played the whole game tho


Didn’t pizza places also have demo disc? I remember having one a long time ago when I had a ps1. I can barely remember what was on it


xbox magazine and demo discs were my childhood


Ahh... the good old days. Nice!


I remember playig  the dead rising demo disk like 50 times


God....i remember i had a demo of resident evil 2 on the PlayStation, it was a timed 10 minute demo. So i played those 10 minutes over and over and over. To the point that i knew everything by heart. Them were the days..


I vaguely remember being a kid and getting one of these magazines with a demo of a game where you are a fireman, I don’t remember much else but I’m assuming the game never came out


Vietkong


i miss splinter cell


I used to play demo discs on the OG PlayStation all the time back in the days.


I did until one wiped out my entire PlayStation memory card


I miss the Burger King games


I remember subscribing to the Xbox magazine and getting a monthly magazine in the mail, complete with a demo. Those were always the best days of the month.


Same for pcmag. I got a demo of this monster truck game you could free drive around this huge map and just go off jumps. Always wished there was an updated version one day


I absolutely had those demo's, played them into the ground and convinced me to get both chaos theory and doom 3


I remember a PS1 demo disk where you could play like 20 minutes of GTA 1. I remember playing it over and over. Doing all the missions fro my the first set of phones.


i prefer online demos, back in the day these magazines were so expensive in my country.


I know- this brings me back.


I remember baegging to get these when I was a kid. I'd see the disc and want to get it so bad.


Hell demos themselves are pretty much non existent now


They still exist, except now they’re called “early-access” are not free, and more or less the incomplete game you’re going to be receiving at release anyway. But don’t worry, DLCs will fix that, for more money.

Brave Fencer Musashi on PSX Pizza Hut demo disc, loved. Actual game purchased later, hated.


Arrrf, c'était le bon vieux temps, on attendait avec impatience la publication de ce magazine !


I remember when back in the day they had a Daggerfall demo on PC Gamer. All you had to do was crack the demo and you got the full game.


I still have one that has the extra splinter cell levels on it and one that has some rock band songs on it.


While cares about the demo discs. I miss splinter cell:chaos theory. That shit was amazing!


I think its about time Splinter Cell gets a reboot/new game


I miss games that had demos directly on them under their “extras” section of the menu. Those were so cool!


I miss Splinter Cell


the GTA1 Demo😍 I played the 15 min 1000 times


i go even more vintage:  
i miss shareware!


I don't, half of them broke my OS even if they were fun and I'd not know of half the games if it was not for the demos.


I played the pa rappa the rapper demo for about a year when I first got the PlayStation. There was a game called IQ and it was super fun. Plus I played the metal gear solid demo for probably about 3-400 hours before I actually got the game.


I loved PS Mag's demo discs! I cannot tell you how many hours my sister and I put into the 2 character demo of Tekken 3 before my parents finally got us it for a birthday.


Doom 3 was my favourite Doom fight me


These were so much fun to get. I miss them as well!


The doom 3 demo at a LAN party I hosted for my birthday was amazing. No one had seen any gameplay, so we installed it on one of the best pc’s at the LAN and I got to play it while everyone else watched. We were blown away by the graphics and lighting, even turned off the lights of the room we were to make it even more authentic.


Magazine demo discs let me think about my childhood


That Chaos Theory lighthouse demo SLAPPED


Disks face down on countertop.

*internal screeching*


Ohhhh fuck yeah baby. That Splinter Cell curtain.....


You can make your own


Any one else as a kid who went to safeway in the 2000s remember when Shoen jump magazines where giving out Blue eyes white dragons? the magazines had no plastic cover so you could have just picked up the thing give it a shake and the card would just come out


I still have the demo of the original Age of Empires. Such a disappointment that the demo campaign was not included in the final product.


most of the games i
owed  were demos


I got sent to collections after I subscribed for Xbox magazine at age 11. Totally worth it.

Edit: And totally worth the demo disc.


An older example: my very first (only?) hack was bypassing the   activation screen for a game for the BBC Micro which had been distributed on a 3.5" floppy.

The full game was include, but would only boot three times before activation.


Not a gamer, but anime magazines and art magazines came with demo discs as well and I made a point to save them.  The anime ones would have the first episode of various series and a few other things... I wish I could remember which, while the art magazines had textures, brushes, instructional videosetc that you could import into your software.  They got rid of those for downloads, which makes sense in 2022 but it doesn't quite feel the same.  I think you have to go through a verification process to get them and then you have to go through the process of downloading them, rather than dragging and dropping from the CD into the desktop.


I never knew this was a thing, I would have been on a magazine raid at my aunt house. I used to replay demos again and again.


Those were good times!


Definitely had that official xbox magazine, good times...


I still have my collection from Official Xbox Magazine. I have demo disc 4 - 85 and then some of the 100's but I never saved the cases or the sleeves, just the discs.


chaos theory was such a fun game, i loved splinter cell as a kid. made me feel like i was really a spy saving the world


I still have my ps1 demo disk containing Parapa the Rapper.


Man I loved these. Played some demos more than full games


Haha I remember parents used to say these discs had viruses on them that would destroy the console


I want to see people do speedruns of demo discs. Like you just have to go down the list and beat all the demos as fast as possible


we used to steal those from CVS lol


God i miss the days you could get a demo to see how the game is and runs on your pc :(


This was my childhood. Gaming at its peak for me. Still love it to this day.


The Pizza Hut PS1 demos were legendary.


I miss my fiance


Safeways and Lucky's hated me! Stayed swipin these as a bebe kid.


I miss the Splinter Cell games


Legit pissed off they never released a Chromehounds demo but by all reports it was a very "meh" game


And the ones that had multiple demos on one disc for like 5 bucks.


Careful, Xbox boys will attack you for wanting to “pay for demos”. Source: I’m an Xbox boy and I miss demos paid or not


Whenever my folks would stop by a gas station- they’d always let me buy the latest GamePro… ah those were the days.


Playstation Jampacks


Man did I play the shit out of the Syphon Filter demo (1st level up to the subway entry) that came in a Playstation magazine.


I collected about 5 RE2 demos back in the late 90’s and showed them to all my classmates and did not share any. I just gloated in their agony.


Everyone here for nostalgia… I’m just trying to figure out if this disks are sitting on carpet or a hard surface….


Pfft Demo Discs

Try Demo tapes... the biz..


I miss having full pc games in cereal boxes.


I do too. Except that one that had Viewtiful Joe on it that erased your memory card. 

That was a painful day…


Wow I grew up with a PS2, didn't know that was a thing. Seems pretty cool.

Did all the discs have the same demos or were they random?


Splinter cell chaos theory, one of the best games ever made.


I remember I had the demo disc for the original GTA on PlayStation 1. It had a 5 min time limit if I remember rightly. 

I played that demo as if it were the full game on 5 minute loops for hours at a time! 😂


This is a mood right here. Miss this.


I remember getting the battlefront 2 demo from a PS2 magazine and I played the fucking shit out of that before my parents got me the game lol. What a game that was.


I miss complete games at launch.


PC Gamer 5.10, if ya know, you know :)

Demo disks are an amazing archive device.  With magazines of the '90s trying to stuff the entire cd with as much rando info that they could.  You could dl a lot of the ISO's off the internet archive.org


Back in the day my cousin had a bunch of demo discs for the PS1. I played the first level of Gran Turismo so many times!


I remember playing the Fuzion frenzy demo over and over when I was in like 5th grade. Good times


Got a xbox 360? You can burn your own OXM demo discs, they dont need to check for official media, just the correct demo data.


Demos have given way to pre-orders nowadays.


I especially loved it in the late 90s when Pizza Hut was giving away PS1 demo discs. Some of the best PS1 games btw like Crash Bandicoot 3, Spyro, Metal Gear Solid, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Gran Turismo, and Ape Escape


PlayStation Magazine was sick with the demos. Miss the good old days


frankly I miss nothing , I began playing with tapes (amstrad cpc), you can have so much now compared to before I love it and with a much better quality...

What I miss from my youth is a good eyesight lol not being able to read small prints etc


I used to steal these bitches on everytime a new one came out. Had a pile of them


I miss demo too...


The nostalgia


Tony hawk pro skater 1 demo any1?


I used to love demo discs. Such a cool way to try out new games and I had a mini collection of playstation ones from PlayStation mag and some others back when I was a kid growing up in 90s and 00s.

They even encouraged Indies and homebrewers in some mags, you'd get to try out an unknowns concept game in some of them.


This is the first time I've seen OG xbox demo disc's acknowledged.


Now they just release the demo as the "full AAA game" and call it a live service title.


These were incredible


So much trash compared to downloads


Yooo, i actually had that top one - played the republic commando and unreal championship 2 demo's on repeat


In 10 years you're going to miss discs, in general. I suspect they will push for all digital next generation.


I miss playing the demo discs my brother got as an EA tester of some sort for PS1 and PS2 games


Omg I forgot about these things


Who remembers walking in Walmart or some where similar and asking your guardian to buy this for you in the magazine section ? Lol great times


To me they always seemed like they had full games on them because I suck at games and never could get to the end of the demo.


I have a bunch of these Xbox demo discs


I remember going to the borders book store after high school and being excited to see what the playstation magazine demo disc would have. I remember grabbing the issue with the metal gear solid 3 snake eater demo disc and the cashier stared at it for a good second and said "whoa, metal gear 3." I was like heh, you betcha that is a demo disc for the 3rd metal gear my friend. That borders got closed down a few years after and it's been an empty location since.


I miss the ability to read a cd.


PS magazine is why I still have dreams of running through a warehouse with goldfinger’s superman playing at full tilt


First time i ever got caught shoplifting was because i took one of these demo discs out of the magazine lol. Good times


Pizza Hut demo discs


These days your lucky to even get a demo


I played Silent Cartographer from Halo like 50 times on a demo disc before my parent bought it for me, lol. Memories...


Wow. The last time I bought a dead tree magazine for a specific computer (okay I'm dating myself now it was an Atari ST) they stuck a 3½" floppy on the front. You can well imagine how much one of these ST Format magazines cost back then, considering they had to be imported from the UK. I think they cost around $15 each at the time. But then again there wasn't an internet back then that the average person can access. But there were pirate BBSs ☠️🏴‍☠️


I got a sly Cooper one way back.


Some demos have more content that the final games...


wow, forgot about these.  yeah fun fun


Those were the times. No trials today.


This is for those who don't know of [Internet Archive of Maximum PC cover discs](https://archive.org/details/coverdiscs?and[]=subject%3A%22magazine+coverdiscs%22&and[]=subject%3A%22games%22&and[]=collection%3A%22maximumcds%22). There are a lot more, but I picked Maximum PC because that's what I read when I was first getting into PC gaming.


These would still be awesome for people without high speed internet. Especially for indie  games


Funny story about this demo disc. 

There was a version of it out of one of the old gaming magazines where the disc art looked identical to the SC:CT art minus a banner saying demo or something to the effect. 

I must have played that demo level 100 times since at that point I had never played anything like that before. I convinced my dad to rent the actual game from Blockbuster for me. When it was time to return it, he accidentally grabbed the demo disc. Blockbuster never noticed, so I ended up with a free copy of one of the greatest games I've ever played.


Frankie of Halo fame was a writer in this mag before destroying Halo.


Fucking Chaos Theory…perfection


Real question. Why? You can just download a bunch of demos


As a poor person, I think these are the reason I prefer to play many, many bad games instead of good ones.


Egm was my shit


100% can relate to this. As a kid all I ever saw were demos. And I’d play them over and over hoping to see more of the game with a “glitch” or something. 

The fighting games which required you to go through the whole demo loading process to play another 3 round match were horrible 😂


English was not my mother tongue and I barely understands it. I never knew "demo" means that its just a snippet of a longer game. we past around the demo disc of Warcraft 3 until everyone at school play it, and everyday discussed strategies and secrets on how to beat the 3 levels haha.... that and Age of Empires demo practically consume a whole year of school lunch time.... so little content yet sooo many analysis and discussions.... I swear there were even myths like someone build an army so gigantic it filled the entire map.. and all of them battle to death... lol what a good time


Yep looking forward to retirement in 25 years so I can buys some games and have time to play them


This is 100% me, I cherished my demo discs and played them over and over again, wishing I had the money to buy the full copy. Now I have hundreds of triple AAA titles and barely any time to play them.


Oh man, those PC Gamer demo discs featuring their mascot, coconut monkey.  Those were the days.  And those rare issues where they included a full game, that made my year right there.


Or how about the fact that it's easier than ever for developers to issue demos on the games stores, buuuuuuut they don't and no one cares. Video games are now a buy first fuck you later type of deal and it's just accepted.which I don't understand because literally every single damn game that is made has a demo for people to find bugs, but because gamers are now brainwashed to just accept whatever shitty 70 dollar game comes out, it is now just normal. The 90's will forever be the best time ever for anything.


This is me, My mother was never able to afford a console for me during my younger days, now I own every mainstream system and yet only play my pc and yet I only touched about 30 of the 250+ games I own on steam alone lol


and that include world of warcraft 7 day free trial disks at blockbuster rip and a bag full of junk food


Oh yes, I replayed Operation Flashpoint so many times. Once I got my hand on the full version another 100hrs has been spent on playing with the mission editor.


Hahaha.... You were poor


Are you me? Because I was coming here to say literally exactly this!


Same here! I'd run demos into the ground, and often my actual game purchases would come because I was in love with the demo. Ultima Online and Starseige: Tribes jump to mind as fitting that pattern.


I remember being so excited to play Hunter on my demo disc.  My parents didn't let me play Mature rated video games, but they had no idea my demo disc had Hunter and Halo.


Isn't that the truth. I have so many unopened games it's not even funny.


To be fair, demo disks were substantial things back in the 90's and early 2000's. You can explore multiple giant 3d virtual worlds for free. In a world where magazines and TV shows offered you just a passive viewing experience to be able to boot up a computer or console and just lose yourself while trying out multiple game levels was a real treat that I guess we just take for granted today.


The original demo of Oddworld Abe's Oddysee... I played that though so many times I could clear Rupture Farms blindfolded by the time I'd saved £30 for the actual game.


I maintain a flashy gaming pc, not because i need one, but because we couldn't afford one when I was a kid.  

Now I have one and I'm too tired to use it most the time.


Are you me? Pizza Hut demo disks


Was just thinking about this.  My family was well off but the recession limited the amount of games I could play (was probably for the best).  Now I have games in my Steam account that I have never even downloaded.


I love when a new game comes out and I don’t have time to play it and when I do have time I feel too burnt out to play something so demanding instead of just turning my brain off and playing some casual stuff


My family had one of those 200 games! demo disc for PC. most of the games were garbage, but I sunk hundreds of hours into them. I remember Sim Ant VIVIDLY


I'm pretty sure my parents would give these to me as a birthday gift. I didn't know what a demo was at the time so I just thought my console was glitched and I could only play 15 min at a time before it kicked me off. I begged my parents to pay to take it in to get fixed but they couldn't afford it.

I can't tell you the storyline to Wind Waker but I could probably draw the first island by memory from playing it 1,000's of times


Was looking for this comment. They never fail to make me laugh


De de de de demo disk.


It was my favorite show they did. Now the channel is a hollowed out husk.


Mothers be aware


Because we're flooded with them, it took effort for the publishers to make and distribute them so they wanted to make sure they were a great selling point for the game itself. Now game makers know if you're just going to watch any number of youtube vids before you pull the trigger on it, so why put a lot of work into a demo?


Steam will refund any game within 2 hours of playtime. We basically get a full game demo of every game on steam


Agreed, well said👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼


They don't make them anymore because they just want you to buy the game right away.


To me distributing a demo is a huge show of confidence from both developer and publisher, because not only does it need to draw in players who are only vaguely interested in the game, but it needs to hype-up and hold the attention of people who were already planning to buy the full version. 

A bad demo can lose sales just as easily as a good demo can win them.


There's holes, oh god... There's holes!


It reminds us that we're getting old, and that can lead to workplace meltdowns.


I posted to quickly and didn't look, sorry ft, will look harder in future, trying to change it now


Game save for Playboy The Mansion on the second disk, clearly.


Cause Splinter Cell Chaos Theory is that hot.


Good question, I took it off to keep ya happy 👍😁


Because he placed the discs shiny side down.


Looks like Jack Thompson finally got a Reddit account.


We can show that


I liked that they usually went all out with the game's theme. Is it a spy game? The manual looks like a buncha dossiers and manilla folders. Is it a WWII shooter? Maybe the manual looks like it's been dug up from a battlefield. It's just one more avenue for the devs to get creative and I'm sad that we'll never get those again


I had the one with the purple swirl on it and it was Interactive CD Sample Pack Three. It was like a 5x5 of games to play. I played each one maybe a hundred times.


I think I still got that disc somewhere too, was awesome


Doom 3 and Chaos Theory were both fantastic games.


I wanted to work at a newsagent just to have these discs when they didn't sell, it was my dream back in the day


Seeing that brought a tear to my eye.


We had a similar magazine. After a while, only videos with reviews and gameplays remained on the disk. Closed a long time ago.


I had a subscription to “CD-ROM Today” when I was like 13. Half of the demos were productivity software, but they had plenty of game demos too.


Ahh the Amiga was a game changer too, that 3.5inch  hole in the side made the big external cassette player on the C64 look old school back in the day, when my mate got his Amiga I was so Jealous 😁


That was my thought process by the time i got half way down the page,,,, some chap above was talking about "online play" with demos,,,,, i'm guessing said chap is a lot younger than me


I always wanted to ask the newsagent if I could buy the missing disc one cheaper and found out they some agents keep the discs behind the counter


I got a King Kong demo once from Macas with a kids meal 🤣


Those were so cool! Crash 3 baby!


It does make it hard to know which disc goes with which magazine, I had to put the disc in to know which games were on it


The number of quarters I sunk into that arcade machine.....


Your kids will joke about dad's quaint old games as they step into their simulator :)


Lets not give up hope on a new Splinter Cell so easily.


That actually makes sense in a way. Most demo disks featured only one or two of what we would think of as AAA games.


Me too, I have a couple of cheat books too for the PS1 that were basic walkthroughs but give them a read every now and then just to remember the good ol days and how good they were, today we're spoilt for choice and easy to research online but back then it was a thrill to go out and read magazines to catch up on what's new and how to get through a game


Unreal champ 2 was one of my favourites too, I thought it was where the Unreal engine originated from 😁


[You can get it for free right now!](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/death-drome-gwo)  This is one of my favorite websites in the world, it's a hell of a nostalgia trip.


I remember getting a demolition derby demo for PC back in 1997 and played the one arena demo every night for a year, the magazine cost $9.99 AUSD and it was the best value, played it on a Pentium 1 I think, I couldn't believe how good it looked😁👍


I'm not sure it must be, but Splinter Cell is and was still awesome


its filthy , where are the mods when you need them


I didn't even think of that! They were yelling at us🤣


That's was a great idea,. Currently wish there was a Warhammer Chaosgate demo


My life will never be the same 😂


I tried playing it today and realised my cd player doesn't work, I'm going to have to buy a Sony internal CD player off eBay and try an install it myself, have to keep the original Xbox going!


Few because instead of becoming a reason for someone to buy the game they changed into a reason for someone not to. Word of mouth and youtube clips work better.


It's why most people bought computer magazines anyway.


All that stuff is abandonware and archived now:   https://archive.org/details/pcgamer-cdroms


The ones from around 1996 have that underground base. well, at least 2.6 (July 1996) does.


Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.


Can't speak to PS2 but if they were anything like Xbox magazine I think it was a monthly thing and each edition generally had different demos altho there were some repeats.


OG tekken, looking at you


It wasn’t on a demo disc I think but I can remember an out of map glitch in the demo for EA Skate. I loved the game so much back then and played it for hours. 

The out of map glitch gave you access to almost the whole map which was crazy.


Ugh same, when we got a PS1 when I was a kid, we didn't own a get a game for it for like 6-8 months. My siblings and I just replayed the sample disc it came with over and over. Then when we eventually got a few games, we didn't have a memory card so we'd just leave the system on for weeks so we didn't lose our spot.


wow! I thought I was the only one who did this as a kid, the amount of times I would try and see if there was some kind of secret method to prolong the game or play the full the version is countless. *sigh* great childhood


[removed]


The only time you got excited about the game freezing up was at the end of a demo because you thought you somehow unlocked the rest of the game.


> And I’d play them over and over hoping to see more of the game with a “glitch” or something.

[Wish granted with these games!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjh0S8df0fo)


I remember I was so excited when I find out skate 3 had a glitch to bypass the time limit on the demo and I would play Minecraft trial until my mom bought me it for the Xbox 360, goood times!


Just cause coming clutch with the infinite time glitch


You can’t get demos from the App Store?


My favorite demo was the Starcraft demo.


Same, but my retirement backlog is gonna so sick, though.


I'll likely never play my steam/gog/epic/gala backlog even if i had a second lifetime :P too many bundles, freebies, and mega sales to ever play them all, and then there is so much emulation/retro-hw.  Quite honestly I have so much stuff I often have a harder time choosing what to play than anything else.


the first game i actually bothered with buying the CD key for and not just finding a crack for was the PC Gamer demo disc that had a $20 unlockable copy of Monkey Island and Secret of Monkey island. Ever since then, it's still been one of my favorite game series


Well, apparently they don't release demos anymore because they figured out that for a large chunk of a potential customer base, a demo was enough and they never bought the whole game. 

I miss them too though.


Yeah, honestly if they still did demos I'd probably buy more games.


there definitely needs to be more of them, but a decent number of indie/smaller devs still do demos on steam (and beta/free weekends)

early access convinced a lot of devs that you can just charge for your demo now, unfortunately


I think you're only considering the publishing aspect.  From the teams perspective a build is a build whether it's just uploaded or if it goes to disc.  When you're already running behind and working your ass of to stay on schedule the impact of creating a demo can be really hard on the team.


There are so many songs that i hear the demo disk cover of anytime they play now.


They still make demos, what do you think people are playing at events? They just don't release them anymore.


I kinda agree with you but let's be honest: 2 hr is a forced standard (with very good reasons since it's not the platform responsibility to let you try the game and kudos to Valve for introducing that and still being the only platform that I know allowing this in such an easy way) that can't really let you experience every game without that "time limit" constantly breathing on your neck.. It also depends on the game itself: ~~what looked like a cool mechanic might get repetitive too soon,~~ (EDIT: as others pointed out this didn't make any sense - a demo is a short demonstration so yeah can't really tell if in the whole game it gets repetitive or shallow) you might not like the feel of the game or the aesthetics as much as you thought. But this is just my opinion, I often replay demos to get deep into the mechanics and gimmicks of a game. Also the "time limit" for the RE2 Remake demo was actually a nice way to do this, without having to rely on the platform's eventual refund.

What isn't my opinion? Not everyone can afford to put, idk, 20/30/40/50 dollars/euros/etc. on HOLD to try a game with the added risk of losing them as soon as the 2 hr mark is passed - even though I \*think\* in some cases you can still get a refund after that, if it's like 2 hr 10 minutes.


hello, i played 80 % of the witcher 3 campaign and around 150 sidequests and found it to be totally boring all 250 hours of it. please refund.


I don't think you can refund games that require another auncher on top of steam, for example: uplay, origin, social club games.


Meh sometimes it’s ok, but also some games purposefully pad out the beginning sections to make it so you can’t even get a refund (games w in depth character customization for example)


Sometimes even more than that, I bought the game "it takes two" to play with my wife but she didn't want to. So I returned and wrote the reason for it was because I had no friends to play with. They refunded me, it was one day or two after I purchased.


And because they can send you the demo directly(see  Octopath Traveler/Triangle Strategy)


Calm down Son, tell us how many holes do you see? Two? Fuck! Mission Failed! RETREAT! RETREAT!


It really is lol. I played that game over and over to the point where I could beat all the levels without triggering any alarms haha.

Chaos Theory and Pandora Tomorrow were just amazing.


Why is it spoiler? Stop abusing tags for clicks


It was the only bonus to the back room jobs. Well that and stripped books and magazines and the rare damaged books we’d toss. It was against store policy but we all did it.


Good call. I just remember them mostly missing unless you got there when there were a bunch of magazines.


What? Pleas explain


Oooohhh no mate,first we start old school so they learn to appreciate the old games and little by little we go there.Same with Cartoons,gonna try "prohibit" classic TV cartoons,is gonna be Old School Powerpuff girls,Cow and Chicken,Dexter's Laboratory...then once that they understand gonna watch Pokemon with them,Dragon Ball,Naruto...the basics🤣🤣🤣

Sorry,I hate modern cartoons😅


I hope, I really really do, Blacklist was actually pretty decent and I'm sure (I hope) Ubisoft is hyper-aware of the loyal/dedicated Splinter Cell following.


I totally get what you're saying. Just seeing former industry titans like Unreal, Painkiller, TimeSplitters, Midnight Club, and Splinter Cell turned to nostalgic jpegs is sad.


Revolutionary for its time tbh


Mine was Bloody Roar 😂


[removed]


I did the same for Skate 2! It was funny seeing how much content they actually put on the outside of the playable demo area, probably the main source as to why the skate demos were so big lol


Wow the fact you’re telling me this gives hope to my inner child that he never wasted his time trying to find the glitch in his demos 😂


Holy shit that's wild haha I played that demo so God damn much before I actually got the game.. Probably the most time I've ever put into a demo other than Fight Night, and Never knew about the glitch lmao.. damn!! Would have put even more of my time into that it if I'd known


Sample discs for PS1 and PS2 were so good... I remember playing Tony Hawk demo again and again because there was no "full game" in stores nearby.


I unfortunately had the same thing. Got my PS1 from a yard sale and it sat there forever until my dad found a Pizza Hut demo disc at a yard sale. The one with metal gear and crash on it. It was amazing being exposed to those two games as a first time PS1 owner. But unfortunately the only full games that I got were sports games such as golf. Try giving golf to a kid that just got a taste of metal gear and see that goes 😂


Smash Brawl masterpiece demos... I remember someone beating Ocarina of Time in the 15 minute demo they give you


I swear I thought I was the only one who did this sort of thing!


The timed demos were a special class of torture lol. They give you a lot but you’re racing against the clock.


Yes! Thinking you’ve possibly unlocked a secret stage was an exciting rush until the game gets back to the PS1 logo.


Wow this blew my mind


I’m not sure if you’re trolling or if you’re serious lol


Maybe so but I think the real reason is you can't tell how mundane and repetitive they are until you buy it. Not releasing demos is just a safety net for the developers and companies, if there were demos of cyberpunk those dumbasses wouldn't still be upside down, because no one would have bought it, see safety net, which in that case severely backfired on themselves.


Dunno, I only bought Puyo Puyo Tetris because of the demo, which was fairly enjoyable per se. And I suppose single player games, with a backstory and all, would catch more customers too.


But early access IS the full game just played before people not in early access right? If not that's some batshit crazy thinking lol.


So there is no beta testing until the final consumer product? Nothing to show finance to get approval to complete or even in most cases for AAA games, start full production? 

What did most companies say before showing footage of their game at E3, demo? Beta? Early version? Either way it wasn't complete, but playable.  

The  closest you get to a demo now is a frigging COD beta


The biggest issue is supporting the demo. Demos at an event can have some minor issues and everybody understands it's an early build. They also run on "controlled" hardware so you don't need to worry about hacks so you don't need to be as careful in how you limit the demo.

Demos in general are a different build which means another version to apply fixes to which also might mean needing specific demo fixes. You also run into deciding which is more important, releasing the demo early to build hype (or kill it) or polishing the full game. Releasing the demo after the full release may not be very effective and since it's a different sku, sometimes this means progress won't transfer. You can also run into the situation that the start of the game is not a great representation of the gameplay but the game is complex enough that you can't skip the tutorial. This don't even go into ruining the story if you start to far ahead.

Overall I think demos are not very useful nowadays because of full game trials. Especially when developers are having enough issues getting the full version released in a polished state.


A demo is not what you get to play at in invite-only event or someplace you had to purchase a ticket for. That's an entirely different piece of controlled software even though it shares the name "demonstration." It was a free demo released to the public to whet the appetite and build hype around the full release.  


Some games like Rise of the Triad would have entirely different levels than the full release. In my eyes a demo like that still has worth today, and I do revisit it from time-to-time.


I refunded assassins creed origins with 3-4 hours. But i explained that most of it was benchmarking, and that i couldn't get it to run smoothly in my pc.


I think demos were much the same. One level of Splinter Cell really isn't enough to tell if a mechanic gets repetitive.


actually nevermind, I googled it and the answers there say that its possible to refund even those.   


I personally never tried, since I never buy those games.


🤣


Wasn't area 51 an arcade shooter? Or maybe I'm thinking of something else...

Edit: oh I'm thinking of the '95 arcade game, not the 2005 game. Nevermind.


I agree... waaaaay back in the day I used to subscribe to Boot magazine before they became Maximum PC. It always came with a demo disk with one or two big titles and demos for a few lesser known titles. I think that was how I discovered Redneck Rampage... and a bunch of other games. I always wonder how different the gaming industry would look without that era of competition. I wonder if the modern demo system via steam (or similar) is better or worse. I feel like a lot of games on Steam get buried. Look at Among Us.... it was released almost 4 years ago and no one figured out it was awesome for 2+ years.

My 30 year old me would say maybe a little bit more effort in school would have been great. 

My 15 year old me would probably still try to hardflip the hospital gap for hours. Just to try a tre flip afterwards.


I’ve beaten Minecraft Java Edition demo in the 1hr 40 it gives u


Hmm...if they released a demo for cyberpunk, it would have been 10 minutes long and probably actually polished unlike the game. Further adding insult to injury.


Its not my opinion, just what I have read on the topic a while back.

I loved demo disks! So many games I would have never bought otherwise I only got because of the demo. FEAR, Dark Messiah and Call of Juarez.


I mean that's what it's Supposed to be, but a lot of devs seem to feel that you can start charging as soon as your project compiles anymore


That's good to know! Thanks for sharing, mate.

Unfortunately I discovered the poor performance of Origins when I got to the first big city.. Damn it..


But playing it over again 100 times is, and it never got old.


Yeah now that I think of it it doesn't make any sense, you're right - what I was trying to convey was, like, experiencing the FEEL or maybe the VIBE of the game. Don't know if I'm being clear, english is not my first language so I'm sorry for any misunderstanding


What level did they pick for the Chaos Theory demo?


Yeah I figured. It’s a pretty unoriginal name, so no surprise! It seemed like it was gonna be kinda dumb at first, but it was actually pretty brutal and played really well. A super solid, enjoyable shooter with an awesome story.


All it takes is some streamer/influencer it seems, doesn't matter what language they are, but they have to power to create such a viral sensation to drive curiosity and more importantly, sales.


Possibly hmmm didn't think of it like that lol, I guess it could be used deceivingly too dammit! But given how the final product ended up being there's no way the demo wouldn't have had issues too lol.


Taser only this time, ok?


Not sure at the moment, I went to play it and it looks like the cd player shit itself, it's opening and closing but not playing anything 🤔😪


I've played the Chaos Theory demo on many platforms and it's usually the very first mission


wouldn't they just focus on the demo and proceed to release an unpolished, bugged-ridden game anyway? Legit curious as I'm not an expert


Capcom and Square-Enix have been pretty good about releasing demos lately.


Demos hurt sales.

It may sound paradoxical, but it's a fact.

The experience of the past is absolutely clear: If a game has a demo, even a very good demo, it somehow satiates people's desire to *experience the game*. And when the game releases in full, this desire is now missing, and "To buy or not to buy (at full price)" becomes a more *economical* decision, rather than *emotional* decision.

And knowing that game prices drop by 30-50% in just one year, plus the fact that there are regular sales every 2-3 months, players who don't *covet the game experience* (in a biblical sense, almost) will think 'Nah, let's wait'.


Better idea: normalize not preordering. Or at least not preordering until reviews are in.


Does anyone remember demo disc with game magazines?


It won't solve anything.

If demos become mandatory, companies will focus on optimizing and polishing the demos, and making them deceptively good, and leaving the rest of the game a broken mess still. Age of Conan leaps to mind. They did a beta, with first 20 levels (out of 80, I think). And it was magnificent - rich, polished, fully voiced. But once you get past lvl 20, voice acting stops, it's just text, and quality of content kept getting worse and sparse. Levels 60-80 were almost completely barren. Having that lvl 1-20 demo was useless.

 Best approach is still to simply not preorder, and wait for full reviews from reputable sources. It's the only way.

Having said that, I do like demos. They help to see if the game runs well on my hardware, and whether I like the feel of combat and controls. There's been quite a few games where I was iffy about the game, and never would have bothered without a (SMALL!) demo download to quickly try it, but ended up buying immediately because of how good the demo was. I don't want to download 80+ Gigabytes, even with a 2 hr refund window on Steam, just to treat it as a demo. The playable version couldn't have been more than 3-5 GB of that. But I think some companies did a bunch of research and concluded demos weren't worth it and didn't translate into more sales. It could be PR bullshit though, I wouldn't put it past them.


I think they'll give you access to the demo as a reward for preordering.


We were still getting demos up until a couple of generations ago. Discs, then downloadable demos. Now, they just rely on misleading gameplay trailers.


Capcom has been releasing demos for all of their new games and each one has been very indicative of the actual games. I don't know how it's so hard for other companies to do the same. I want to get Street Fighter 6 just because I had fun in the demo for the story/avatar mode, and I'm not even that into fighters. The demo was just fun to mess with.


And normalize releasing a playable game..


Diablo IV did it right


A demo won't solve anything and will just take away resources from the full game. A demo also doesn't guarantee performance issues will be solved. They could put so much effort into making sure the demo is polished, that the rest of the game could suffer. Development costs money and prolonging that by releasing a demo, which would also come with its own distribution fees, isn't the fix all you think it might be.  

Unless you're buying into early access, a pre-order just shows a company that you're interested in buying their product the day it releases. They don't profit off of pre-orders, they profit from the sale of the product when it releases.


Doesn’t Sony do this ? They have playable demos for their games if you have the ps plus premium subscription.


Back in my day, this was normal, whippersnapper.


As great as this idea is, it’s not feasible with how long modern games take to develop. It requires the devs to take time to cut out a vertical slice of the game, like developing a little micro game alongside the main project.

People need to just stop preordering when there’s not point in doing so anymore.


Simply don't pre order.


Normalize not preordering games or just waste your money idrc


Just don't pre-order.


Or just buy the game months later on sale. Fuck full price gaming. Screw AAA rip offs.


Why would anyone pre-order a game any more?


Open Betas are essentially demos. Diablo 4 beta convinced me to get it. Still didn’t preorder, but I am 100% getting it.


is there any EA reference in this? Because I'm 100% in for the idea of a playable demo


Yeah good luck changing the landscape of the gaming industry with a Reddit shower thought. But really, with the (file) size of modern games, I dunno about downloading upwards of 100gb+ just for a sample (depending on the style of game but I’ll assume you mean AAA in which yes you would need most of the assets installed even for a timed demonstration) and also the question of is it anywhere near worth whatever testing and verification and other hoops they would need to jump through just to get it out there? If your response is “just create a smaller area to demo within where you don’t need ALL of the game assets installed” then you’re asking them to spend time away from working and fixing up the main game to create an entirely new thing that won’t even be in the full release or representative of the final gameplay/world design. It’s also easier to get a vertical slice looking and running better so it could be even easier for them to deceive you there. The reality is it was infinitely easier for companies to make and release demos when games were 500mb in size or even when they started becoming multiple gb’s in size. Also when they were designed to be level-based and whatnot. They aren’t designed the same anymore so you can’t have all of the same previous expectations. If you’re tired of getting burnt on games, the simple and easy answer is to wait for the reviews. There are a million sources to go to upon a games release to find out exactly how it turned out and how it really looks and performs on your system of choice at launch. And I’m not talking about IGN or some corporation like that, find some smaller YouTube channels that you trust that will give you the lowdown. I use channels like Skill Up, Angry Joe Show, and Gmanlives just to name a few. If you can’t wait for reviews to come out and tell it how it is, then that’s on you and not the devs.


I was just thinking about this. I remember when game demos were very common. Most games had at least a small demo available. I'm glad that Steam takes refunds so easily, because there's no pain like paying $60 for a game only to be stuck with it if you hate it.


What the you cancel your pre order when you find out our games are not finished and not optimized


I would prefer order if there were demos right before the release


That's called piracy and I fully endorse it.


Devs won’t spend a dime on additional resources for demos when people preorder without knowing anything about the gameplay. That’s what stopped demos. The increasing cost of them against the fact people buy without trying anyway.


when i was a kid i used to replay demos instead of buying the full game, most of the time the demo was one of the best levels


Facts.


I agree with what others are saying that they could “polish a turd” and just make the demo play great while the rest of the game is a mess. But, I will say the RE4 demo was the reason I felt ok buying RE4 day 1. I think that game turned out really well.


Everyone else have that game they just kept repeating the demo of?

My two were Just Cause 2

And a game called Grid Iron : Backbreaker (which I would kill to have on PC)


It worked previously, it ought to work now. I remember getting game demos on cd with pc gamer magazine and running them to see which game to actually buy. And I once managed to skip the built in block for the settlers II demo and play one extra mission, glorious. And man, the warcraft I demo disc ran hot.


dont fucking say normalize just say “we demand”. releasing a demo isnt a social trend that needs to be normalized its a business practice


Does anyone remember demo disks on magazines, I based alot of my decisions after playing them I feel like they dried up in the early 00s


...Or you can simply stop pre-ordering.


My thoughts are people will spend money on broken crap and microtransaction riddled bullshit because they always do. Calls to reform this come and go. The outrage does not outweigh the need for immediate gratification. 

We will never get out of this hole unless there is legislation or lawsuits at this point.


This vid might be ten years old, but it still speaks truth.  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QM6LoaqEnY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QM6LoaqEnY)  


Game demos decrease sales in nearly all cases and cost resources to make, so companies don't make them.

&#x200B;

Is that fair? No, but there should be a wider push to honesty in games media instead.

Or just more of an education of the general public on what to expect.


A lot of games still do this, OP, and guess what? The demo section works fine. Then when the game comes out, it’s the other parts of the game that struggle.


I think people should stop supporting preorders. It's become normalized because asshats keep fishing out money for games that are absolute garbage on release instead of waiting for a finish product and demanding the game companies stop with this assanine bullshit. If gamers stopped supporting the devs early access, pre orders, and game previews by giving them fucking money then they would have no choice but to put out a playable product on release day instead of trash like fallout76 and cyberpunk 2077.


They won't because they know if people see how broken a game is they won't buy it. 

Games that heavily push pre orders and day one bonuses  tend to be the most broken.


Shoot, normalize releasing a playable game on the specified release date or push back the fucking release date. Game shouldn't need patches months after its release in order to make it playable. 

Once we can get that unanimously agreed on maybe they can start on playable demos.


They’ve always been releasing trailers for games that have been completely rendered in an isolated engine that is different from the graphics or fps that we get on release. They would do something similar with the “demo” we get I’m sure. It would look and act amazing, then SSDD


Unfortunately, a demo would in most cases result in the opposite of what you are looking for, devs will be diverted to making a polished demo and the actual game will be worse. Polishing is typically near the end of the dev cycle, so the game is typically complete and it can be tricky to section out a portion of a game for a demo without leaving breadcrumbs behind that will spoil the rest of the game, or in a couple cases accidentally give the whole game away for free( Crash Bash demo comes to mind). The demos there are now are typically early builds that aren't any more polished than what we have been getting as "finished games".

There are exceptions though, Capcom does demos quite well, the RE4 Remake demo was good although short.


Square Enix has done this a lot. 

I bought nier automata because of it, octopath traveller existed, etc. so despite square kind of dropping the ball this practice has been fantastic for them


Normalize not preordering things


I wantt o give full credit to the devs of Diablo 4 here, they ran a closed and an open beta plus a server stress test, during the open beta I did notice stutters transitioning through areas but in the server test the stutters were gone. I have put 30+ hours into it and the performance is polished, the writing is meh but the game itself is ready for release.


> performance... to the game's performance before we put down our money.  

The problem is that the demo is never optimized.  Because they don't have time or people to dedicate to "optimizing the demo".   
I remember trying the CoD4 demo, and it worked like garbage, you can probably still download it and compare it with the final product.  I thought I'd have to upgrade my PC, but when a friend of mine lent me his copy, I found I could run the full version on my PC even with the graphics set to "high".  Something that was absolutely not possible in the demo.


Why? People are dumb enough to blindly pre order anything, why release demo and risk profits?


Use the option to refund on steam.


[deleted]


If a game sucks, making a demo is counterintuitive. 

Forspoken had a demo that told me that it sucked. The full game sucks. It sold terribly under expectations


Ya, its a poor business practice for sure!  

Here, have our brand new Turkey Club Sandwich with Jalapeno poppers on the side, and real fresh home fries.  

The bun and poppers will be available in the coming months so the batter is hollow (no jalapenos).  

But here is an exclusive high quality canvas bag for your brand loyalty and blind purchasing...but its made of gym bag nylon and the batter is tofu.....aaaand the plate sometimes drops your food through the table 🤷‍♂️🍔 SPLAT 🤬


You can refund any game within 2 hours on steam, or just pirate a copy for testing


If people didn't throw their money at the screen, maybe then your idea would materialize :) Until then...good luck. For what it's worth I do think it's a good idea...


Normalize not buying a $70 game without a playable demo.


Preordering is what got us here. What do you get for preordering? New skins? Extra weapons? An extra side mission? 

Or is it, “I want to be on twitch with before everyone else”? I want to be the first person in my group or friends to have an opinion on it? Whatever your reasons, publishers don’t care. It’s not the developers, it’s the game publishers. 

Want to stop seeing terrible AAA $69.99 PC games? Stop pre ordering, simple. What lessons have we taught these publishers? If we push it out, we will sell x amount of copies. Then, the original buyers will post everywhere, “this game sucks”. This negative feedback, is FEEDBACK. It drives clicks, which not only gives the game more engagement, it actually leads to more sales. 

Cyberpunk, No Man’s Sky, the list goes on. If the companies continue to develop the game, so be it. If they stay in alpha forever, aka, 7 days to die, we essentially are the beta testers. You’re paying to beta test it. 

If you’re interested in changing the industry, use what works in other industries, engagement/money. Don’t like a restaurant, don’t patronage it. Don’t like a brand of coffee, don’t drink it. 

Stop buying shit, and you’ll stop complaining about it.


Pirating is my demo. I play the game for hour or two and if I like it, I buy it. If I don't, it gets uninstalled and forgotten about unless it´s a "sale wishlist" good enough.


Unfortunately it takes a lot of time, resources and planning to release a demo. And no it really wasn’t “common” place. 

Demos existed alot more, but only like 1/40 games would have a demo. Compared to our 1/1000 today. Shareware was more of the era your thinking of.


Since 2019, there have been very few games worth preordering, for me at least. I preordered The Last of Us 2, Horizon Forbidden West and Tears of the Kingdom. I’ve purchased many other games, but those were all I preordered.

2019 disappointed me with Doom Eternal (too much platforming and micromanaging of every resource) and Borderlands 3 (Meh story with forgettable characters).


The devs would spend more time making a playable demo than working on the actual game.


You'll end up getting polished demos, which require time dedicated to specifically that and taken away from the main game development. You're not going to have release windows pushed back due to this, so you will end up with worse games.

I preorder some games and I will continue as I haven't ever been 'burned.' If a game releases with some issues, they generally get fixed. 

I completely understand when others don't want to preorder because of this though.


Firstly, I don’t know why you think you are even in a position to demand anything “I think they should do xxxxx”.

People are already pre-ordering, without them releasing any demo etc, and they totally have the call to create whatever pre-order arrangement they want.

You are in no place for negotiation, your only option is “pre-order or not pre-order”, and even if you don’t, they won’t care because enough people do.

I think you have over estimated your influence.


I don't think it's necessarely shady, sometimes an indie studio needs support to start developing a game, since they may not have the ressources. I thinks it's fair, in some cases, because if you believe an idea and want to invest(?)... I mean, why not?  
Speaking as a game developer myself.


So, what we've learned is that playable demos, especially really well-made ones, actually *decrease* sales. People play the demo, they're happy, then move on to the next game. Most people don't play games like the people on this sub (probably) play games; the median gameplay engagement is shockingly low and shallow.

So you've got two choices: Either you release an amazing demo that tanks your sales, or you release a lackluster demo that also tanks your sales. It's a no-win scenario. 

Instead, what you do is you release the entire game for free, and then you add microtransactions as a way to generate revenue. But that has really terrible implications for game design, and many core gamers are turned off by F2P games with deep MTX schemes. So then you figure, well, why don't we go for a subscription model and sell this as a live-service game? But that blows up in your face too because building a live-service game is a lot scarier than shipping a game that is feature complete, and most studios quite frankly don't know what the fuck they're getting themselves into.

Alright, so what's the solution? Sell complete games and have a fair refund policy. That's basically the best of all worlds.


Me - Boomer - never paid for a pre-order in my life but played tons of demos.

Looks at Millennials and Gen-Z in disbelieve. You guys pay for stuff you dont actually have yet?


Why would they do that? People are pre-ordering without those demos so why would they bother? People who pre-order are chumps.


Used to be a thing.
actually I want developers slammed with 50 million dollar fines for putting out unfinished products and CEOs and Share holders fined a million dollars for allowing lemon products to hit the shelves.


They did that but then devs made the demo good and everything that comes after the demo borderline garbage. 

It's not even about that. We need to stop buying products and start buying games. Period. Same with movies and any form of art. It's emberassing to the human kind that we consume like pigs everything that is put on the table. Like something is just shit, you don't have to even look at it, let alone "pardon" the devs on releasing a broken game. 

Work on your bs filter guys. There are a lot of good games out there, that are not AAA. 

Also: DONT. Pre order.


Normalize people not complaining over every little thing.


Have you never heard of this thing called a refund?


Nah, I’m actually against demo’s. I like the little bit of risk when you go off brand and either get a hit or a flop. That surprise can make a game sometimes


They're just going to optimize the shit out of the demo and it's not going to be reflective of final release performance anyways

All a demo does is help you decide whether the game style appeals to you


You mean beta?


It was common place, i remember like it was yesterday...

Now day ppl pay full price for an alpha version, why would they let us try something for free?


Steam figured that out by offering refunds if less than 2 hours of game has been played.


Very likely an unpopular opinion but anytime I feel like buying a game I will quickly pirate it, play for like 30 min an hour and then purchase (or not). Of course assuming it isnt an online game, in that case I tend to wait for those free weekends they sometimes do, or if I'm very desperate try it at a friends house or something, like old times

I was born in the 90s, I lived the era of the Demos and they made it so much easier.


well, you would had got tricked in the case cyberpunk

but I agree is way better than watching scripted video


Buy when it's 10 dollars and fully patched.


Facts, although anthen did have a demo...


Or, hear me out… normalize publishers doing whatever they feel necessary and customers deciding on their own if, what and when they buy.


I think this is a good idea. I did this before I preorder resident evil 4 remake. Played the demo first and I really liked it. Same with Diablo 4.


This is exactly why they never will do this again. They are not trying to be more honest and transparent, they are trying to make as much money as possible.

No company will put out a demo of a bug ridden game that plays like shit. They would just torpedo their own sales and the game would be a flop and dead on arrival. So that option is off the table and never happening.

If they wanted to release a demo it would have to be highly polished and do the opposite of tank the release. This is also not a good option for them because it may take them more time to get it polished and push back their release date. The longer it takes to release the more money they are losing in dev costs and by not getting it out and moving on to the next game. So that's also not a good option for them.

Their best option where they make the most money is by getting games out the door as fast as possible and maximizing pre-orders as much as they can by not letting anyone know the game is bad or not ready till it's too late and they already have your money.


Never gonna happen.  Plus wouldn't do much good.  They'd just polish the hell out of the 15 minute demo and the rest is the game would still be garbage.


You should not be pre-ordering any product. There is an old saying 'If you cannot afford to be in business, then you shouldn't be in business. If they have a project opportunity then they should go to the banks, get the loans, build a quality product and watch how the profits return ten fold.

I might be being naive there, but its how everyone else on the planet has to go about things.

But yeah. When I was a kid in the old Spectrum 48K days, I used to love at the every month a new game magazine would be released with a bunch of new demos and what was called poke tapes (cheat programs). We got our gaming news monthly and come release rarely did the games disappoint. Not because they were all masterpieces, but we were limited to info and so everything remained a surprise when first playing it.


then you run up against the next issue: the devs, knowing that the preorder sales will depend on the quality of the demo, optimize the shit out of the demo, like they should ideally do for the entire game, so the demo runs well, tricking the customer into pre-ordering, thinking it'll run well, and ending up with a nasty surpise when the game runs like dog crap.

its pretty much the same thing with E3 demos. the demo is worked on seperately, and is ensured to be as good as possible, leading more people to buy the actual game which may or may not hold up to the standard set by the demo. 

the best solution is to not pre-order at all. back in the 90s, pre-ordering made sense because you were playing with physical discs, so copies of the game sold out very quickly. but now, with nearly every game becoming digital, at least for PC, copies don't sell out at all. you can buy a copy of a game at the same time as a billion other people, and still have enough for everyone else who wants it. Licenses don't work the same as physical discs, and there's basically no real world advantage to pre-ordering a game vs. paying for it on day one, day ten or even hundred. its going to be the same game, maybe without a few cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay in the slightest.


>at least 30 minutes of gameplay

with modern games, that's the full single-player mode! /s

&#x200B;

>Normalize releasing a playable demo before taking pre-orders

or, even better, simply stop preordering things.


I was there gandalf, i was there when demos were the normality and you could get them with magazine, i was there when the strength of man failed and those were forgotten.


Game developers will never do demos again. Demos only hurt sales. No demo has ever, and I mean ever, brought more people to a game than it turned off of it. Dozens of studies showed this.


I appreciate games that have a demo or an open beta, but a demo for a single player game could easily be dishonest by just choosing a section of the game that runs the best for the demo. Then you get to the game and performance tanks everywhere else. 

I think people just need to be smarter about preordering. I always compare to getting tickets for a movie to see it opening night. You’re putting faith in it being good before it’s even out and you’ve seen reviews. You also don’t need to see every movie opening night. I only preorder maybe 3-4 games a year. Other games I’ll wait for it to come out, and maybe grab it on sale when I’m not currently playing anything else


the worst part is no refunds , download time seems to count as playtime, a few years ago i downloaded a game realised my pc couldnt handle it went to return it and i had 1.5hrs playtime eventhough id only loaded the game up and looked around in the main menu for 2minutes.


Remember the demo for Warcraft 3 Reforged?

That was interesting.


I really wish there was more of this as well. I have core memories of playing the Fight Night Round 2 demo on PS2 for months. I think my dad had just bought another game, and got the demo for free?(Too young to remember how it worked specifically w/ Discs) After months of playing that demo, a neighbor had got the full game... They had me, the youngest, do all the "hard" fights you would typically have your older brother do.

Flash forward a couple of years: Early Teens playing Xbox with no money. I had beat all the games I owned 10 times over and no idea what to play next. I would avidly scroll through the demos and try ANYTHING that looked interesting. I didn't ALWAYS buy the full game, but if it was good enough I did extra chores to save for it, or it went on the Christmas/Birthday list. One demo I do remember grinding was Just Cause 3.... I could play that demo over and over for hours at a time.

I'm too young to be having these boomer thoughts, but these kids today just wont know what they may be missing out on. On the same note, we didnt have all the polished free to play games that are out now. Kind of a give and take in my opinion. Sorry for the long winded response...this one brought me back


Honestly props to Diablo 4, this has been the best beta experience I’ve had since legend of legaia.


Back in my day….


You can always try the game for free before making a purchasing decision.


I'm all for this! I've bought some of my all-time favorite games I may never have bothered with based solely on playing the demo or trying them out because they were "free" with Xbox Gold or PS Plus. World of Warcraft, State of Decay, Dark Souls, Slay the Spire, Overcooked.


Call of duty beta did not help the game. In fact audio was worse.


I'm glad to see a lot more demos being released on Steam these days.  
Speaking of "demos/free trials" Dead Space (2023) 90 min demo\*  


\*Still have to deal w/EA


I used to get hype for demos in the 360 days. A good multiplayer demo would pull tons of buyers - wouldn't this still work if it got attention?


This is the reason i pirate games on pc, I download it, see how it plays, if it’s good i’m buying it, if not then deleting it, free demo for most games


It’s a nice idea but they’d just put out a super polished demo to get even more pre-orders and the rest of the game will still go unfinished. Look at Anthem. When that original gameplay demo was revealed at E3 the dev team didn’t even know that was the game they were making.


This was the standard in the PS3, X360 era. It sucks that it's gone backwards.


It exists, it's called open beta, because those betas work the exact same as the final product


The Industry has been shown that releasing a demo directly hurts sales. even well polished games rarely get a demo. If you really want to see more of them then people need to start buying based on them


PC would potentially really benefit from this, assuming the developers are able to get data (with player permission of course) they can work with to fix some common issues. In house testing is always important, but getting the game out into the hands of thousands of people with different PCs could really help some of these rough pc version launches, specially if they have the time to work with said data.


Normalize not buying pre-orders


Gamers. Gamers are the ones who have encouraged and enabled the change. See demos produce numerous outcomes, most of them negative. They can make a bad game look good (rare, but possible.), show how bad a game is (not good from a developer’s standpoint. They have to make their money from this), make a good game look bad (especially if they pick the wrong section to show.) or encourage people to buy the game if it’s good. 

Out of those options, the majority are bad. Especially when you consider the work required to make a demo. 

Ultimately there’s far too many bad things against playable demos and not enough good. That’s why they disappeared. 

Oh and gamers are especially bad at self control. A lot of the people who complain loudest and say they won’t buy, do buy. On the first day. With preorders. 

That’s why preorders are for fools. Until gamers stop buying preorders and stop rewarding bad practices, it’s not happening. And that’s on gamers.


Why would they even consider it?  They know that people will throw their money over a trailer and preorder the hell out of it anyway. Remember, the reddit community is probably 1-5% of the gaming community as a whole. Our loud shouts in our echo chambers don't impact the larger sales figures. 
So while demos were a thing of the past, we consumers have shown that we'll spend our money anyway, so why provide it?


This would not fix anything. One, if a developer is rushing to release a game when would they have time to make a demo? And if they did make a demo for a unfinished game they would just make sure the demo worked before the full game. This might make things worse. The resolution is to not pre-order games ever. There is zero reason to give a AAA developer your money before hand. This isn't 20 years ago when there might not be enough copies and its going to sell out.


How about normalizing not pre-ordering shit.


Pre-ordering games shouldn’t even be a thing, back when you had a physical copy it kinda made sense so companies could start producing those copies but with digital games? Why? Makes no sense


This was the way in the 90s though demos faded in the early 2000s. 

By the mid to late 2000s we see the rise of pre-orders.

Are we regressing backward as consumers or did entertainment corporations get smarter in having us part with our money so easily?


I depend on reviews before I make any decision on a game. Even for tears of the kingdom, which I would’ve trusted more than any other franchise to deliver a great game, I waited to see the reviews (performance specifically).

The problem isn’t companies not doing demos or pitching new ideas to make easy money (micro transactions, pay to play online on consoles, release a half baked game at full price etc). The real problem is people being ok with paying for them which makes companies stick to that routine and keep throwing more pitches similar to them (must be online to play a game that you already purchased i.e., Redfall).


I mean you don’t really need to pre order anyway


If they did this people would just play the demo and not buy the game.  What’s in it for them?


It will never happen because it very rarely benefits the people selling the product. End of story.


The problem with a demo is that they can be optimized and bug free pretty easy while the full release still ends up trash.


I would love if stores like steam REQUIRED a playable demo before providing pre-order as an option.  Would go a long way to assure gamers don't continued to get screwed.


Simple answer: don't pre-order. They will never run out of copies. It just encourages crunch culture and/or releasing broken games. Hardware is the only time you should pre-order. Plus they ALWAYS release pre-order "exclusives" to the public eventually.


People will do anything except not preorder apparently


Normalize banning pre-orders so people can actually see that games are shit before buying 😅


Might convince me to reorder again.  
Unlikely to happen though, defeats the whole 'get money before there is real product' reason behind preorders.


They would lose too much money


This is why I am loving how Capcom is doing things these days


Why would a game company invest in a demo?

Gamers have overwhelmingly confirmed, again and again, they lack basic self control and will pre order on nothing but a good marketing campaign. No need for a demo when FOMO gamers blindly throw money at gaming companies.

A gaming company is still a company, and operates to maximize profit. They've done the math. It shows that marketing hype, pre-orders, and fixing the mess after launch generates the best gross sales/least expense/most profit mix.

I get it. I also want to see high-quality game launches. The premise of forcing quality via a pre-launch demo is good but it doesn't get the CFO's interest.

You want to see change?  Lobby Steam to lengthen the parameters of their return policy. That will get the CFO's attention.


So many people that are serial pre-orderers are really struggling with the fact that they've been made into marks by the game industry.


Pre-ordering, like demos, once served a purpose. It allowed gamers to guarantee they had a copy at launch. This is no-longer necessary as digital copies are more commonplace. Demos were for cheap marketing. Release a demo to get people hooked so they buy the full game.

At this point pre-orders is buyer beware and yeah very shady. Last game I pre-ordered it was for the bonus... that no one in my entire district received. So lesson learned.


lol games are not even done until like a day before they launched, that why there is always  huge 50gb+ day one patches

I do wish demo disks would come back like ps1/ps2 era but games are just too big


Just played the Diablo 4 beta.  
It was legit, and seemed polished.   
I will purchase this.  
Did the same for the most recent Battlefield.  
It was just... ugh.  
Did not purchase.  
Betas / demos 100% will sell me on the game.


So "Normalize losing a ton of money"? I don't see that catching on.


1. Demo's are dependent on mechanics that may not exist in the games current stage (you know, part of the reason it's in early access).
2. Game will not be optimized so yo don't know it's perf, that's kind of an ongoing task during development.
3. A bunch of the graphics, models, animations ect may be incomplete.. so can't really show that either.
4. Demo's are a lot of extra work, they aren't just going to take their current build and throw it out as a demo.

You are asking for a slice of the cake while it's still in the oven.  If you want to know the state of the game, just watch someone review/play it in early access...


The Beginners Guide had a great demo that didn't spoil the game but did give you a good idea how the game play would be.


Games are exponentially more complex now than they were back then. Betas are the new demos. 

Do what Diablo IV is doing. Beta test with launch bonuses and preorder extras. Just be sure to execute on release. Hopefully they do.


From a development standpoint with today's games, a demo won't really be done until the whole game is done, so why bother.


Bring back demo disc's from the (game Informer?) magazines.


Ah I miss the good old days of pc gamer magazine where demos were always coming each month. Just a great time for gaming


That’s long gone bud, even developers have 0 confidence that the game will turn out like the trailer, it’s disappointing I’m 22 so I reckon my age group and abit below are the last kids to experience real, fun, full demos


I hate to say it after the shitstorm that's been happening with the company it's from, but Diablo 4 is hitting a lot of the right boxes at the moment with only 1-2 questionable design choices.

It's had three betas now (one pre-order/promotion req'd) with gifts for participating and reaching certain milestones. The latest one this past weekend was literally called a Server Slam with the intention of testing to see if its servers would be ready for launch. Each beta also included the same playable areas and quests with access to several of the dungeons and three strongholds inside the first area.

As for gameplay, the betas were all pretty smooth even though we were most likely playing older builds of the game. And Blizzard showed that they can adjust things in the game fairly quick with how there were actual buffs and nerfs between the first two betas and the Server Slam (a relatively short window).

As someone who's been waiting YEARS for this game, I'm extremely happy with the state it appears to be in, and I'm hyped for the release that's just a couple of weeks away now.


Sir U/preppie22,  preorder doesnt mean shit. When you preorder a game you are just commiting to purchase something some assholes in California hasn't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for preordering a game? A big d*ck in your mouth


Why are they offering pre orders for a product that will not run out. If you have 70 USD to spend on a video game, you can afford to wait for it to release and get reviewed so that you know what to expect. There's all that hype right before launch and a nice gameplay trailer but that's just it, that trailer had more work put into it than the game to sell the game. Bottom line, don't preorder, it won't run out, wait for review, if reviews are bad, wait for patch, if patch is not good enough, wait for sale or pirate it, if patch makes it playable, wait for sale or buy it full price. It's up to you. I just want us as gamers to stop rewarding these studios for unfinished and defective products, if we buy games after they fix them, then I at least hope they will notice and start finishing their games before shipping. Imagine buying rotten milk everytime you go grocery shopping!


Sea of Stars on Switch released a Demo that has sold me on their product. I wouldnt have otherwise known about it.


You act like we, the consumers, control this decision.
 
A playable demo explicitly harms those pre-orders. The companies DONT want Demos. It requires effort to slice up the game for it, potentially showcases stiff players won't like, and the kicker: Unlike with gameplay trailers, if the demo is too different from the release, that its actually considered fraud.
  
Remember the original Watch Dogs issue, where the trailer was like 10x better quality than release? They got away with that, legally. Were it a demo, they wouldn't have, because _those_ have regulation standards.


This wouldn't work how you think it would. They'd just make sure the demo is as stable as they can possibly make it. It'd be a lot easier as it'd just be a piece of content cut from the main game.

Just don't give developers your money until you've seen the full product reviewed. That's it. That's literally all that needs to happen. I seriously don't understand why people preorder, digital keys aren't limited, also all these games come out with 'preorder bonuses' but lets be honest, that shit gets replaced within an hour of gameplay, or it's a cosmetic in a FIRST PERSON GAME.


I can agree with you on this. The game may still be bad because of bugs, etc. but it can bring players that were on the fence into a series. For example, I was very young throughout the Metroid series. I have been on the fence a long time for Metroid Dread but they had a demo available. It showed me bits and pieces of the game and I was hooked. I played without the ability to save multiple times and eventually downloaded the game. I have been hooked ever since. Without the demo I don’t know if I would have ever purchased the game.


Will never happen. Demos allow a player to make a purchase decision after already experiencing the goods for free. Not always, but typically, this results in lost sales once people either realize the game is not for them, or that they have already played their fill.

Additionally people are currently preordering games hand over fist. There's currently no incentive for the industry to change.


At current state of the industry, they will probably polish the demo


seems like in the late 2000’s-early 2010’s betas used to be much more common place. not sure what happened or maybe i just don’t pay attention like i used to


Resident evil demos help me determine if I want to bite the bullet and spend the $$$


There's not better demo than wait for the game to drop and let your favorite gamer source tell you how is it.


BRING BACK DEMOS!


Capcom : let's these a demo a week before the game is out. It's not even do people can suggest changes, it's just cause we probably should make a demo


Trials of Mana did this really well. Demo is still available on steam! First chapter of the story. All playable characters available. No time limits (managed to get 8hrs out of it prior to full game release).


I loved getting game demos in my gaming magazines back in the day. No pre order. Just a “hey try out our upcoming game. Hope you like it” type of vibe.


Almost all games that can be pre-ordered (or the ones that are advertised heavily) right now have demos you can download and play. In case of MMOs and multiplayer games, they have open-to-limited beta runs.

Not sure about Nintendo games, though.


at least companies like square enix and bandai have done it recently


I feel like all games should be playable on game pass on a time limit. There's no reason anyone confident in their games shouldn't be doing this.


They'd put way too many man hours into polishing the section you play in the demo leaving the rest a buggy mess.


We're coming full circle to demo disks!


I agree, if you are going to take pre-order you need to give people a taste of what they are getting.


Steam offer money back no?


So here's what I think the future will be like for games.  Release dates are now for beta versions of the game.  If you want to play the game before it's ready, buy and play on release date.  If you want to play when it's stable and working properly you now have to wait 6-12 months after release.  It's going to suck.  You'll get spoilers.  People who bought the game day 1 will finish it before you ever get it.  On the plus side, you'll probably be able to get it cheaper and you'll probably have a much better experience.  You gotta chose if Fomo/being a beta tester is more important to you than waiting for the finished product.  At this point, it seems like most people would rather be beta testers because if that wasn't true, companies wouldn't continue to put out unfinished games like this.


Judging from how stupid people are and how they glorify their respected franchises, I don’t see this doing much.


I remember as a kid back in the PS3 days I would have dozens of demos from the ps store and I would play them repeatedly just so I wouldn’t by the game (best example I can remember was sleeping dogs), so I guess this would lower sales


or don't pre-order at all.


Capcom’s been doing playable demos on steam. Same with some EA games. I was able to demo RE4 and dragon quest XI both before I bought them. 


PC seems to offer quite a few demos honestly.


Normalise banning pre-orders

Your game should be finished instead of you shipping dogcrap code to people


It's pretty much rare on console but on PC, it got replace by Beta and Alpha release and it's a common thing on that platform


oh im all for releasing playable demos. its never gonna become a regular thing tho. the current market strategy is to cut corners everywhere and put out as cheap of a product as possible and then promise to fix it later when everyone has already given you their money. the only games that will ever have them are those that the developers think are a 100% slamdunk with no chance of failing. and they dont rly need a demo to begin with.


Cyberpunk showed a playable demo to journalists.  Everyone was completely unprepared for how shit that game was on release.

That said, tons of games on Steam have demos now.  Some also have a prologue, which often carries progress over to the main game when it's available to buy.

This seems more of a console specific problem at this point


or just not preorder and buy on steam to have the option to refund


Spot on.


Demos suck for the dev teams that are already overwhelmed.


I'm all for a demo, but let's not pretend it will be any indication of how the final game will run. Anthem and Outriders both had demos and the final game was an unoptimized mess with little to no endgame content at launch.


I miss all these free ps demos back when, like getting them at pizza hut. I'm sure I have a few sitting around.


I read a looking time ago that demos lessened sales. But it may be different now that games generally are larger and more varied than 20 years ago.


Re4 did this and is was made be pre order the game. But they’d most likely make the demo incredibly good and then when you buy the actual game it’s nothing like the demo


Or have open betas like Blizzard has done with Diablo 4.


The Resident Evil 4 demo turned me from a skeptic who didn't even think it needed a remake to a full on pre-order hype beast.

In contrast, the Battlefield 2042 beta was a massive red flag and probably didn't help sales but instead hurt them


Or simply don’t preorder. Nowadays preorder is more and more like a scam targeting loyal customers


I mean, it was normal at one point in history.  
You could download demos from the web, and they where on like pc magazines DVDs.

But it seems like dont do that and rather manipulate people with payed reviews and eyewashing trailers makes more money


Lol


This is why I like indie devs. There’s a game I’ve been really looking forward to, Smushi Come Hone, purely because the demo is great and the game wasn’t even done yet. 

I’ve been feverishly stalking the creators page for updates now all because they took their first level and isolated it as a demo. If I just saw it on the steam store I’d probably skip right past it but now I want to go out of my way to pay full retail for it when it comes out in a month or so. Even if it’s only like 20 bucks im gonna yet as much money at this project as I can


Normalize not normalizing anything that companies haven’t already considered. What they should do is raise the quality of their games before release. Their sales are going to be what they are unfortunately and Forspoken definitely got hit hard with sales because of their snotty demo.


The number of hours playing Warcraft 2 "Shareware" on LAN I could have had a doctorate, lol. And all it did was hook us to Warcraft forever. We went out and got Orcs and Humans and played the crap out of that as well as Tides of Darkness and, when released Beyond the Dark Portal, all long before the battle chest was ever a thing. 

Bring back demos, and it will sell more in the long run.


Big corp publishers don’t care because gamers are still buying their games anyway in preorders and they’re making millions. Gamers have spoiled them by doing this so they have no incentive to change as boycotts do not work with gamers


I wish they would just have a trial period for any game like in the Xbox store. 10 minutes to get the feel of wheter the game is for you and seems optimized


do you mean like the dead space trial thing that was posted some hours ago?

Pick your game of choice,  play a couple of hours and then buy if you liked it?


I totally agree. Capcom does it best. I actually preordered the last 4 Resident Evil games because of how awesome the demos were. I still remember the RE 2 Remake One-shot demo. I didn’t want to buy at full price. But I tried the demo and holy sh*t. It was so awesome I had to preorder.


stop pre ordering games.

Wait for the game of the year edition. Make them pay. You are responsible for the money you spend. Stop rewarding rewarding irresponsible studios.


Steam refunds ?


It's what they have done with Baldur's Gate 3. Everytime they make updates, you so have to restart. I have played so many versions and will still buy the game because it was just so amazing.


From the consumer's view, it's a good idea.

From the business's view, it's a terrible idea.

Here's a pretty good and short video on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QM6LoaqEnY


Or just don't preorder a game you are unsure on. There are some rules to follow for preorderinf that can help offset the risk. 

1. Only preorder from a known developer. 
2. Don't preorder if it's their first time in that genre. 
3. Only preorder if you know it will give you the game time you desire regardless. 

There are some outliers to this such as battlefield 2042 being an issue with rules 1 & 2. 

I pre-ordered that having but 1000 hours into 3 and 4 and skipping the rest due to the setting.  Still I got a 150 hours out of it. 

Another example is darktide.  It was an immediate preorder due to the setting and more vermimtide 2.  This was despite knowing the issues vermimtide 1 & 2 has at launch. 

They have shown both times the game gets their eventually and I just wanted to play 40k swarm game immediately.


Normalize not preordering demos are a tiny vertical slice.

Normalize the steam return policy where if u tried the game for less than an hour or something you can return it and get your money back.


But, then why would people ever buy their shitty half-finished games? Talk sense for gods sake!!!!! ;)


The modern demos are buying the game outright through Steam, playing 2 hours then refunding with no questions asked.


lol  I just cut out the middle man and DON'T pre-order.    Ever.   Send them a message.  If enough people stopped pre-ordering, they'd stop releasing unfinished garbage.


See?! The whole game will be like this!

(The game is grossly under finished, but studios only care about putting out a polished demo to sell more copies)


No. You can still skirt presentation looks through limited playing time and areas.


Only way it will stop is if people stop pre-ordering.  Who wouldn’t want cash up front with zero product.


Maybe they could do like resident evil games demo. Re8 demo is a little different than actual game. I think you play as one of the prisoner and escape. It was so unique and good. Re4r is just early session gameplay but it was not bad too.


I miss the ps1 demo discs that came in the magazine!


Honestly we could use a consumer protection law like this


No time expecation on demo, and that isn't a bad idea.


A friend of mine is a lead character artist at Activision. He asked me if I would be willing to pay $100 or more (Canadian) for a new game because inflation of new video games hasn't really followed other inflation trends.

I told him 100% yes if I was given a playable demo beforehand to make sure it's something I wanted. Apparently he has been in meetings where this topic has come up and they don't do it in fear people won't pre order after playing and demos, even good ones, hurt sales.

If you have that little confidence in your product you shouldn't be selling it at all. 

This is actually why I will be buying Diablo 4 at launch. I got to play it for two weekends already and I know what I'm getting.


You can ask all you want, but that will not be happening. Also demo builds tend to be forks that are far behind in development because they take a crapload of work and are more often then not, not indicative to the final quality of the game.


Give me 1 hour at least. By the time the game starts up and I adjust my settings etc, I would maybe have 45? minutes left and that would give me just enough feel of the game.


Just wait for reviews from reputable sources. what’s so hard about that. people need to have a little bit of patience.


Just stop pre-ordering games, and normailze waiting 24 hours so reviewers can make sure it actually works before dropping full retail price on a brand new game.

Or, if you're obsessed with being on the absolute bleeding edge of newness, then you pay your money, you place your bets, and you take your chances.  And you have nobody to blame but yourself when it doesn't work out like you had wanted.


Why we don't see demos anymore.

1. In the 90's there wasn't really internet, certainly not Youtube, and pictures didn't show how a game played. So you included a demo with a game magazine or in a pack of demos. A demo was the only way to actually show off a game at the time.
2. A game demo for a AAA game would possibly require you to download the entire game, unless you spent extra time and resourced building a demo specific version of the game. Who wants a 50GB demo?
3. Most game sales are based on hype. If you play the demo, you might not be hyped anymore. FOMO is a thing.
4. A early release demo may allow people to crack protection, or develop hacks for it.
5. People may show off demo gameplay, which is usually less finished, as real gameplay, further hurting sales.


There are only 2 reasons to preorder a game in 2023.
1. There is a preorder bonus thats worth it.
2. So they can preload the game so they don't have to wait for it to download after it releases.

I dont think preordering is enough of a reason to put together a playable demo.


I always pirate a game (if possible) before buying. A demo would alleviate my need for piracy.


I loved demos because I could see if my old machine could hack it. Now it's a crap shoot every time. Buy and hope for the best. I run current hardware for a single year and then I am behind the 8 ball.


Why? Steam has a full refund option if you play less than 2 hours?


...(looks at Balan's Wonderworld)


I miss demo CDs


Just don't do pre orders. Why would you buy a product you know isn't worth that price?


If people keep paying for unfinished garbage they will keep selling it, normalize watching a full review before purchasing a game let alone preordering at all


Public betas = demos that also provide useful data to the developers and under-promise whats to come instead of over-promising, and last I checked plenty of games have had public betas before release.


It's called early beta access. This is basically the new demo for games. Also you could buy a game on steam play for and hour and get a refund, this is also kind of a demo.


it faded away because stupid people were throwing money at preorders and not complaining when their $60 download turned out bug ridden. rinse and repeat, and you get the shitshow that is modern game development.


I am absolutely guilty of feeling “fulfilled” in the experience of games by playing demos/betas. Back when I got playstation magazine I played the hell out of those discs. I wouldn’t say a demo disc had the same effect as a beta. I’ve decided against multiple games in the past few years because of playing in their free betas. Some for GOOD REASON, like Battlefield 2042. Others, like Star Citizen, I just don’t feel like continuing after playing a few times even if it’s cool.


FF7R had a demo and it was just phenomenal. The rest of the game just got better and better. That said from what the comments are saying that's the exception and not the rule.


In contrast, wait for the real reviews before buying the game.


Every game on Steam comes with a 2 hour demo.


I think the practice fell away because most platforms offer refunds for digital goods if you've played only a short period (i.e. Steam's return policy); so instead of developers having to invest substantially in making (and testing, and certifying for console) a demo version they can now focus more energy on making a good release and you the buyer are protected against making a bad purchase.  Time locks and other schemes are also not completely robust making them easier for hackers to defeat - so the only way to have an effective demo is to remove key desirable features.  TLDR; Making a demo game is a substantial investment for a game, platforms (i.e. Steam) often offer returns or money back for dissatisfied customers.


Any preorder issues could easily be mitigated by not preordering. You can’t fomo in and be mad when you find out what you’re missing out on. That’s just impatience. I’ve enjoyed all the games I’ve got early, I don’t really have anything to be mad about. My expectations are in line with the reality. 

I wouldn’t mind if demos became common, but they weren’t released to show the state of the game. It’s more for publicity than anything else, a demo can still be far off from the main product to even really be relevant. I don’t expect to see them really anymore, resident evils are the only games I’ve played the past few years that I’ve known has had them.


Diablo 4 did such an awesome job it should be the new gold standard.


If people stop pre-ordering and waiting until the game is out for a little while, they might do something like this. If people keep pre-ordering then why should they change? If you’ve been burned by pre-orders, why are you still doing it?


Bring back demo discs! Haha


I feel like data has shown this can actually hurt a lot of game sales.


Most studios struggle to release playable final products let alone demos


Normalize 0 support for games after launch


"No LMAO" - game devs

In all seriousness though why? Cdpr did that with cyberpunk in 2018 with THAT demo that took away from working on the actual game 😂


Performance is the number 1 reason I’m glad steam has a 2 hour refund period, I know a lot of indie devs were upset because it could kill smaller games (I’d argue if people like you’re game they’ll keep it anyway), but honestly sometimes with the varying machine specs and the god awful state pc games are released nowadays a refund option is necessary and I really bloody hope all those people who review bomb badly made games like the new star wars a games follow through with a refund.


Glad RE4 did it


That’s not a horrible idea


They do this with betas but they lock you in to only being able to access a small portion of the game so all they’ve gotta do is make sure that section is polished and the rest could be a big fat turd for all they care.


No, because it can cut into profits and requires a LOT more work than people realize. I’ve heard before that demos actually decrease sales because many people will buy a game just because it looks cool and they want to try it. When they find out it isn’t exactly what they want, they leave. Or they enjoy it and just never get around to buying the full game. I can’t imagine there’s actually that many people out there who will only buy games that have demos. 

Demos can sometimes build hype for smaller games and be used as a marketing tool, but big companies usually don’t need that.

With steam refunds, there’s not as much need for demos as there used to be, and companies big enough to have their own selling platform don’t need demos to sell.


RE4 supremacy


Just wait till after release to play.


yes, so much yes. I really hate the limited time demos that are put out for special events then taken off the store in 3 days. Most recently a game I kickstarted did this, told me about the demo, but made me track it down deep in steams promo lists. When i finally got it installed it didnt run because the devs screwed it up. No second chance to play the demo, no fix for the demo. Complaints to the devs? Ignored. So when it does come out I have little interest in it now. 

Its almost as bad as the Capcom and Konami demos with 30 minute total play time before deactivation. 

On the flip side I have half a dozen KS games that do have demos that are not time limited.  There is a place for us and its itch.io one of the only places to find demos for things I have not played.


They won't do that...they'll lose dough


I mean, I was a huge fan of what Blizzard just did this past weekend for Diablo 4 open Beta "Server Slam"

Basically, they released it to public with a full 48 hour window to experience the game up to a certain checkpoint in the game and limited the level your character could get to.

That time frame was enough to allow people to get a feel for the graphics, see if it was something they wanted to spend $70+ on, AND it was a great test for their servers to make sure they were stable enough ahead of the main launch.

Overall, 10/10 recommend an experience like that, because it left me wanting more of the game and anticipating the main launch even more now.


I just wait until the game is out...then a few months later until it's actually finished and on sale.


Normalize not preordering games. 


In 1998 when N64 carts and PlayStation discs were finite resources, you needed to pre-order. 

In 2005 preordering got you special trinkets.

What does it get you today?  A multiplayer game you have trouble logging in to on day one or a single player with a game breaking glitch. 

If you preorder through digital I don't even know what to say. Are you worried Steam is gonna run out of downloads?

Very very few developers earn that "day one" loyalty from me and that list actually gets shorter instead of longer every year.


You mean Community test servers?


Nowadays it’s a beta


Why would Publishers do that? They know themselves that their Games are trash.

You can be sure if a Game has a Demo the Publisher believes the Game is good.


Console players sitting pretty for the first time in history


i just wait for the price drop and sales


Demos need to have a return. Game companies are ruining the industry they're supposed to be creating for


Pre-orders and Season Passes allow people to get paid for thoughts and ideas, this is only going to get worse


The only game I pre ordered is Wo Long because I liked the demo


I remember the Xbox 360/PS3 days bro! 

Playable demos of most games for days before you even thought about buying the game


I don't care about companies putting out demos before a game is released but it would be nice if more studios did demos. I miss the days when I could go game hunting, find a cool demo and that's what made me want to purchase the game. I never had one that turned me off a game before.


The first year is the demo/beta


I think pre-orders should be changed to early-adopters kinda deal. Instead of buy before release, change it to buy within a week or so of release.


Come my child, and let me tell you of a time where we had demo disks...


It would be nice but they’ll never do it. Unless their IP is a polished gem, they’ve got nothing to gain by letting you play before you buy. If you know it’s mediocre beforehand, the product doesn’t sell.


I’ll tell you one thing, while it wasn’t necessarily a demo, I’m glad there was a Diablo IV open beta. Saved me some dollar bucks.


The issue is that releasing a demo takes resources away from the actual game, since it's basically a fork of the existing game that needs its own round of QC testing.


Capcom actually did this with RE2 Remake, RE3 Remake and RE4. Problem is, IIRC, RE3 was literally a 25-minute timer counting down and your gameplay just ended abruptly. But still, it was nice to see how the final game would turn out.


I think gamers were the worst thing to happen to video games


Remember the beautiful tech demo bioware made for Anthem, and the game ended up being a stinking turd?


Diablo 4's tests kind of served as a demo, at least for me. The state of their servers during the last test pretty much settled the deal for me, it was a much better experience than the previous weekends. The only hiccups I have experienced were most likely just a result of me playing the game on an HDD and my parents watching Netflix lmao


Sounds good on paper, but I feel like they'd just spend more time working on the demo to get the pre-orders and then the game would be even worse than it would've been in the first place because they focused more on the demo.


What is the point of a demo from the company's point of view?

People already pre-order. Releasing a demo for a game with a marketing budget doesn't really move sales much in my opinion. If the game is good, word of mouth will just pick up those people suspicious of it later on. If the game is bad, releasing a demo will tank even heavily hyped games.

From the company's point of view it is a lose/lose situation and people will pre-order games sight unseen so why bother?

I feel like this ship has sailed for AAA games. For indie games demos will still probably help hype them up.

Don't get me wrong, as a gamer, demos are certainly nice and sometimes a good demo will convert me to buy it. However, if i was in charge of whether (for example) FF16 got a demo, there is no way in hell i would waste money on it. You pay extra money to release something that in the best case scenario will just not lose you sales.


We need a Gamers Union to fight for our rights!


Old school gamer here, mags used to come with discs, had all sorts of cool stuff, wallpapers, AV trials & PLAYABE DEMO’S!!!


I wasn’t planning on buying Diablo IV on release but the beta weekends have made me reconsider.


I think this is good


What stopping them from having an excellent demo but mediocre/bad game


How about we just stop pre-ordering games, period.  There was a legitimate reason when you had to buy the physical media to get the game but that is no longer true.  Pre-ordering in the current market only encourages the exact behavior you describe.


Producing a demo is much harder than people think.  You don't just take a section of your game and put it out, you need to do a lot of polish to make it run, not include extra stuff, lock parts out, etc.

We hate demos, press demos, show demos because they're a ton of extra work that could be put into the actual game.

Stop pre-ordering garbage and force companies to change.

The problem with the industry is that consumers keep buying absolute shit and expecting a corporation to change because words.


The only way companies will change this behaviour is if people stop pre-ordering.


Semi related, but I really don’t get why a lot of steam games are calling their demos “free prologues” and releasing those as separate games. Did something bad happen to the word demo?


Demos were supposed to become a big thing in the PS3 generation. Never really caught on. 

We’re past that now.


Why? Honestly why would devs care to enforce themselves on this? They continue to release unfinished games and ppl continue to preorder


BEST BUY!!!!!!!


Only gets you so far though. 

Anthem did a full playable beta weekend, and was honestly fantastic. 

It wasn’t until you bought the game and started playing … you realize they only had about a weekend’s worth of content.


At this point for me this is why gamepass and eapro exist. Sure I don’t own the game, but for a single player new release it’s enough time to beat it twice if not more. 

When you think about it you’re renting a new game for a month for 15 bucks. Let’s you play it, has some benefit outside of the new release (try a new game available on the pass you haven’t before), and if it’s a buggy mess well at least you tried. 

Think it also sends a message that your sales are bad but your game pass downloads are high because you released buggy, unfinished garbage. That if you pulled the game off the pass, but actually made it complete, that maybe people would buy it because they’re interested enough to spend 15 but not 60 on critically “unacclaimed” drivel. 


Sure buying and refunding is easier and doesn’t cost anything, but you only have two hours on steam for the guaranteed refund and probably less on other platforms, but this message is for those who just have to preorder games and can’t wait normally.


Steam allows you to refund any game within 2 hours of playtime. You have a fully feature complete 2 hour demo of every game. If it's unplayably broken, refund it.

Other platforms might be different I don't know but refunds for shit games is what should be normalized.


For me even demos don’t represent the final experience of the game. Just recently Forspoken had a demo on PS and I thought it was ok’ish but I still decided to wait until release and boy that’s was the best decision. Today’s games are too big for a demo to convey the overall gameplay experience.


Yeah would be nice but never going to happen with the numbers these fucked up “AAA’s” still put up.


Freemium games are sort of like a demo.


Unfortunately a demo won't work, as if a publisher is going to release a buggy/unfinished product they're not going to hesitate to deceive you by ensuring the demo runs swimmingly.

Fortunately if you game on PC there's already a workaround for this (for most games):

Steam has a 2hr window where you can basically refund any game. So if you're worried about getting scammed, buy the game on Steam, play for (just under) 2hrs, and if it's bad get yourself a refund.

Obviously not every game can be played on Steam tho, which is the only downside.


Or, just don't take presales until the game is ready to release. I don't buy games at launch, anymore, since Titanfall (console). 

My friend bought me RD2 at launch. Was a nightmare on my PC, and should have ran fine on my build. Demo, or no, the companies shouldn't release a not-ready game. 

Today, internet reviews are what make or break a game. Better to have people pissed off a title is 'taking too long' vs broken at launch, in my opinion.


Nah, in this era the demo would be pre-order bonus or exclusive on PS+, game pass.

Do you remember demo disk? Good time...

I miss demos (been gaming 45ish years so remember when they were common) but these days there isn’t as much need for one. Information was harder to come by back then. Demos got your game noticed and people talking more. Now, just don’t preorder. Not that hard. We aren’t waiting on physical shipments. Wait till release. All the info you need to make an educated decision is out there. Demos aren’t usually optimized and are buggy because it is a demo and they’re working on the full game or they are fantastic and bug free because they put a bunch of resources into it for a good impression but then the game isn’t like that and people bitch about that. Just don’t preorder.


The correct thing to do is to just stop preordering altogether. There is no benefit to this nowadays as they are much better at gauging expected launch day sales through better market research and they won't run out. Even if you want to get the nearly worthless preorder goodies you can just "preorder" it at Best Buy one day before launch, then read the reviews and if the launch sucks, just not pick up your order and get a full refund. 

Speaking of market research, demos aren't necessary for marketing anymore. Nowadays games are marketed through Youtube, Twitch, and other venues.

Seriously, people who keep complaining about preordering need to realize that the only solution to this is to STOP DOING IT. But people keep doing it so it must mean the companies are doing something right, so why should they stop?


Or just don’t preorder, find other ways 🏴‍☠️to play bullshit cash grab ports (looking at you last of us), and only then purchase games that deserve it. Feel like most of us are on the same page with that, but we’re not their target audience. Their target audience is kids that pre-order and are willing to pay billions in microtransactions. Making quality games is no longer the biggest indicator of profit. If you could copy/paste a game knowing you’re gonna make millions, most would do the same. Vote with your wallet.


For all of Square Enix's bad business decisions, the one thing you must give them credit for, is that they continue to make demos for their upcoming titles.


We don’t even get food ish games after release. A demo would be awful. We should normalize free demo before buying


Don't pre order. It's that simple. Playable demo is not the final product anyway so it's not that reliable.


They won't 

That being said:

* Don't pre-order
* Wait a couple days until steam reviews or the reviews of your trusted reviewers are in

Yes you're gonna miss out on the pre-order horse armor. Yes you're gonna be a couple days behind. Such is the price.


Bring back magazine demo disks/discs!!


I agree this would be great, but as someone who works as a game dev both AAA and smaller you would be amazed at how many pivotal story decisions and even mechanics are tweaked right up until the 11th hour. I get that demos in the early 00’s had a disclaimer that the final product would be different and you still see that a bit now; but I think the complexity of games now and the power of review bashing leaves less and less room for any *larger* differences.


I got to play the "Server Slam" for Diablo IV this past weekend. Just 2 days of access. 

It was great, I got to play just enough to decide that I won't be spending $$ on the game. So great for me bad for Activision I guess...


That would result in demo levels (often the first few) being incredibly polished at the expense of other aspects of the game since they would be prioritized to make sales.    

One good example would be Watch Dogs. The opening level is incredibly well made and exciting. If that was the demo, you would probably be sold on pre-ordering the game. However, its only the opening level for watch dogs and the rest of the game doesnt live up to the same high.


The problem is that demos take up way too much resources. These resources are fundamentally zero sum. Meaning making a demo means you are not doing a bunch of other things to move the game forward. 

“But they made a demo for a conference”

Ok sure but when you demo something at a conference or expo, it’s in a controlled environment. You control the amount of time they play. You control the hardware. Also if a demo on that environment crashes no one really cares that much. They just restart the demo. That’s easier to deal with than a wide spread demo where there is an expectation that it functions properly on all hardware and doesn’t crash frequently. The expectations are much higher and as such require way more time to polish before putting it out

Ok so let’s just say you make a demo. You polish it and release it. What if people find bugs? Do you fix them? How critical is it to fix something for a demo? Which again takes resources away from your main game. What if 3-6 months down the line your add or remove things that are not reflected in the demo. What do you do now? Do you remake the demo again, taking more resources away?

Game demos are a marketing tool. 

Contrast that to you know just giving out keys to influencers to play your game. This is in fact way cheaper to do. And can have a much greater reach than your demo. You’ve already polished the game and now are using streamers to “demo” the game for others. Which again costs you almost nothing and has a much wider reach. And doesn’t require a separate branch to be constantly updated


*coughs* Battlefield 2042 *coughs*


It reasonable


Demos are usually a taste of gameplay and connection testing but that's pretty much it. It wouldn't help fix day one bugs


The only reason I'm willing to spend for the new system shock besides the fact that it's amazing


It won't take, demos mainly are a relic of the past outside of indie titles. It's harder to sell a dumpster fire rushed game when you have part of it available to try out and publisher's know this.


I dont understand that fckn itch to pre order nowadays. Sure I was pre ordering too, but last two times it was Elden Ring and Cyberpunk. 2 games in 2.5 years. I had enjoyable experience with cp, sure caught some bugs, mostly funny but I didn't regret the purchase. ER had stuttering, which is sucks but it was playable.

Some years ago I was spending more money on pre orders, buy when the tendency became clear my expenses on pre orders have been decreased to mentioned above.

Either consumers have too much money to burn or too irresponsible with their finances. Or rather both.

Have patience. Wait a bit. Do not support this fraud with cat in the bag.


How about "don't pre-order".


Yeah, whatever floats y'all boats. C'mon gearbox, stop releasing artworks & stuff and finally let me pre-order Homeworld 3..


there's really no reason for games to make a demo unless they have zero marketability


Both give demos and denormalize pre-orders. They play far too much on fomo and the better option as a whole would just be to allow preloads of encrypted content without having pre purchased the game


They would


Yea, they can very well have a really well polished first hour of the game for a demo, with a smaller scope and then have it all tran wreck afterwards


Back when E3 was a thing companies would spend a ton of time developing a E3 demo to show at the convention. Then later they’d worry about making a game that looks and plays like that demo. They mention that in the “making of” god of war 2016 hour long YouTube video.


This 100% would happen and has happened. 

Diablo 3 open beta first act was clean and people were all excited lol….


It’s a good idea from OP but unfortunately will worsen the situation. We’ll just get vertical slices for demos and it’ll be better than the actual game


The is more or less what happened with Cyberpunk. They pulled developers away from making the actual game in order to make a fake demo for the E3 presentation where they announced Keanu Reeves. The demo claimed to be gameplay footage, but it was actually a cutscene that looked like a demo, created specifically for E3.


Most bugs would be in the demo as well. They aren't going to release a demo showing you how buggy the game is it would just kill sales. That's why demos are so rare these days people used to play them realise the game wasn't as good as the hype and decided not to purchase, they actually used to hurt sales unless your game was really good and 19 out of 20 games are mediocre.


Exactly what would happen, the demo would not fully represent the finished product and they will have a notice saying so.


Sadly, it's very likely this will happen. But, not giving us anything for a pre-order (in-game items don't count) is just plain shady. At least with a demo we can hold them more accountable. It gives us a yardstick to compare the finished product to. It's better than hopes and promises.


It's not like that comes for free, though. If your core gameplay is fundamentally broken no amount of polishing stage 1 is going to fix that.

It's not a perfect solution but it is a step in the right direction


That's literally exactly what happened to sonic 06


Exactly, lull everyone into the mindset of "the demo ran and looked flawless so the game must be the same or better"


They would basically overpolish the start of the game like they did with cyberpunk with that one mission with multiple approaches and multiple endings which definitely wasn't the norm. Don't get me wrong the mission was fun to play even if I knew from the promo video roughly what would happen but I don't think there was any other mission in cyberpunk that had that many variables.


Yup, also overwork us more than we already are in the industry for some "pointless" demo.

So please, don´t.


Cyberpunk 2077 (which in the minority, I still enjoyed at launch,) was like this. They’ve openly admitted that they amazing demo they showcased a year prior (or however long ago it was) was entirely made to showcase the game and wasn’t actually stuff they had been working on prior.

Edit: didn’t scroll far enough to see similar comments, but yep, that’s how it went down.


Man that monster hunter rise demo kicked my damn ass lmao, magnamalo was so difficult


Capcom manages to nail the perfect demo. It's long enough to interest the player and always ends exactly where it needs to in order to get them more emotionally invested in the game.

Offhand, the only demo better than the REmake4 Chainsaw Demo I can recall is the Naruto Ultimate Storm 2 demo, which was just the chef's kiss of demos IMO.


We'll be getting a Demo for FFXVI soon and I'm fully expecting for it to be one of the demo's that press got to play back earlier in the year or from more recent event.


Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio also do it for all of their games, I guess japanese devs are the only ones who still bother doing demos


yes! i think resident evil games pretty much always have a demo


Cause they know their products won't be dogshit. Other companies know, so they don't want to risk preorders getting cancelled


This makes total sense because most people only play a game for about 10-20 hours I think then even if they like it something else comes out


A demo can also turn away players who will end up not liking the game. I, for example, was very excited for Forspoken, played the demo and decided it was not for me. If I had not played it, I would definitely have bought it.


> and "To buy or not to buy (at full price)" becomes a more economical decision, rather than emotional decision.

As a Diablo fan I am really annoyed at how well you nailed it with this comment.


There were a few games back in the day that had really good multiplayer demos that I never ended up buying the full game for. One of them was Soldier of Fortune II, the MP demo had a couple levels and the deathmatch on just those two was badass and I never was inclined to buy the full game because the demo gave me my fill lol.

But a few MP demos did sell me on the full game, F.E.A.R. and BF2 and two of the biggest I remember. Oh, also Q3A.  With MP DM or TDM games I would love an MP demo of a single level.


This guy “marketings”


I think it worked better in the 90s and early 00s because the demo was pretty much the ad. You’d get a disc with 8 demos on it with your PlayStation magazine or whatever and you’d end up trying demos for games you didn’t know existed and stuff like that. 

These days though it would hurt the sales of the piles of rubbish that get released


This is true for big games that have demos pre-release. Its a little different if the game has a demo come out post-release like with DQXI which helped sales. Indie games do benefit from demos.

> Doom is a 1993 first-person shooter (FPS) game developed by id Software for MS-DOS. Players assume the role of a space marine, popularly known as Doomguy, fighting their way through hordes of invading demons from hell. id began developing Doom after the release of their previous FPS, Wolfenstein 3D (1992). It emerged from a 3D game engine developed by John Carmack, who wanted to create a science fiction game inspired by Dungeons & Dragons and the films Evil Dead II and Aliens. The first episode, comprising nine levels, was distributed freely as shareware; the full game, with two further episodes, was sold via mail order. An updated version with an additional episode and more difficult levels, The Ultimate Doom, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

> By late 1995, Doom was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95. According to Windows producer Gabe Newell, who later founded the game company Valve, "[id] ... didn't even distribute through retail, it distributed through bulletin boards and other pre-internet mechanisms. To me, that was a lightning bolt. Microsoft was hiring 500-people sales teams and this entire company was 12 people, yet it had created the most widely distributed software in the world. There was a sea change coming."

> Doom has been ported to numerous platforms. The Doom franchise continued with Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and expansion packs including Master Levels for Doom II (1995). The source code was released in 1997 under a proprietary license, and then later in 1999 under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later. Doom 3, a horror game built with the id Tech 4 engine, was released in 2004, followed by a 2005 Doom film. id returned to the fast-paced action of the classic games with the 2016 game Doom and the 2020 sequel Doom Eternal.


I basically never buy games at release anymore and wait for a year to buy, unless it is something that gets amazing post release reviews (Elden Ring for example).  I will never pre-order a game again.  Never.


Zero reason to preorder anything in today's market. No cosmetic is worth buying a shitty half-assembled game that won't be finished for another year after release.

Copies don't sell out, they go on sale regularly. Just don't do it.


Pre-ordering made sense when you had to get your games on physical media, and pre-ordering was the only way to make sure you actually got your hands on a copy come launch day.

Nowadays it's just pure marketing, a way for them to convince us to pay for games no one has played yet and might suck.


Even even better idea: normalize refund, like on Steam. I cannot believe there is any rationale for people not demanding a chance to refund if they dont like to game.


> not preordering until reviews are in.

The fact that AAA video games are released as they are now pretty much proves that reviews mean absolutely jack fucking shit in the grand scheme of things.


I havent preordered anything gaming related in years.  I just wait, look at reviews/gameplay and decide if I want it or not.


I'm 100% with this. Pre-ordering is not a good idea in general. However, my point is that if they are opening pre-orders, they should at least be based on some tangible demo or product which we can try before we put down our money for it.


That's the move.  If you buy something without trying it, that's on you.  Especially since SO MANY  games are garage at launch now.


Nah I’ll spend my money as I please


The fact that you're getting downvoted 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀


I was about to say... what do you want me to do about this? As a consumer just don't buy pointless preorders in a day and age when digital purchase is always available.


Omg yes and some were super tiny discs


I probably racked up hundreds of hours of Tekken 3 and Crash Team Racing demos. Some other games' demos were time-limited so it turned into a speed run to see how far we could get before time ran out


>and wait for full reviews from reputable sources. It's the only way.

Huge contention with this part.

I would prefer everyone just play the games instead and come to their own conclusions. These review hounds revel on the negativity available through these games releases. I don't like feeding that.  


P.S. Even if the negativity is deserved, in many cases, it is; I would prefer we all just play these games like we used to  back in the day. On our own first maybe with some friends. Then start comparing notes.   


We'll have a much healthier community that way I think.


I think it's more commonly a beta. Which is sort of like a demo - except there's less expectation of polish.


Wouldn't put it past them....


Developers stopped demos because they hurt sales. Games rely on hype to make sales think of how many games you purchase decide you dont like then don't play after a couple of hours. Demos used to kill all those sales unless the game was really good which nine times out of ten it wasn't.


I remember when this happened with Watch\_Dogs there was a huge outcry. Now, it's seemingly normal.


I know right? RE4 remake demo was so good it just makes you want to buy the game.


Was looking for this comment. As much as blizzard has fucked up.over the last decade it really feels like they are back of track with D4. Their communication around this game for the past two years has been phenomenal, the industry should really be taking note.


The open beta and server slam were so much fun, that world boss was an absolute menace.

That's something I wish more online games would do: server stress tests.


Early access is still a good deal. At least you're getting something for what you pay instead of cheap "collectible" items or worse: in-game cosmetics....


Unless the demo was literally taken from the game itself.

You preorder, which lets download/install the game early. But, until the release date, you're restricted to only being able to play the first 10% of the game.

And then the Day 1 patch removes the code that restricts you to just 10% of the gsme.


I played the server slam over the weekend and I can confidently say, I'll wait till the deluxe or game of the year edition is out and on sale for $20.


Especially if you're buying it from a store that's not Steam. Going through support for a refund can be a painful experience at times.


I lived the demo for Just Cause 2. It was on a twenty minute timer. I believe the whole game was there. You just couldn't get far in twenty minutes. I bought the game because of that demo. That was one of my favorite games.


Fair


I remember getting the first chapter of Quake on a pc format in the 90s and and first eight levels of Z.


This video is awesome! You should get more upvotes....


It's sad to see when this happens.... However, I think at least having a playable demo can provide some baseline as to what we can expect. If not at release then maybe after the game is patched.


not every defect shows up after 2 hours, and do it too often and steam will refuse to do refunds.


I'm a millennial and grew up in the era of game demos on CDs. Honestly, I've bought a few games I'd played demos of: Diablo, Tomb Raider, Road Rash, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, and some others I don't remember now. It made me feel comfortable spending my pocket money on a game when I knew what I was getting because of the demo. Nowadays, it's hard enough to know what the game is like without a demo, but on top of that studios expect people to pay full price for a pre-order when you don't even need to get up and go to the store to pick up a game? It makes no sense to me.....


I'm a dev myself (not game dev) and I can tell you from experience that devs NEVER want to put out an unfinished product. It's usually management that has unclear and often unrealistic expectations and expect devs to be miracle workers with absurd deadlines to meet. Management doesn't care how unfinished a product is because you can always "fix it in post production". Don't ask me how many times we've shipped broken software to clients only to patch it in a day just so we could meet their deadlines..... It's stupid.

Anyway my point is, the devs are not the problem. Management is. Why do you think many of the popular indie games launched in a finished state with minimal bugs? Smaller studios don't have to deal with upper management.


Yeah... I guess we're old now and younger people don't mind paying $70 for promises...


A lot of games come out in Early Access at a discounted price for literally this reason. I don't know why a lot of AAA titles don't do this too. Look at games like Factorio, Project Zomboid, Rimworld, etc.. They came out in early access and improved over time based on community feedback and bug reports. Of course the price went up after launch, but the whole point was that you got an unfinished product for a discount so you could try it and help the devs make it better. This attitude simply doesn't exist in bigger studios. They like to hype up games and keep everything under wraps until the day or release.


People that are clamoring for demos don't remember demos that weren't representative of the final product in significant ways. They were made to secure a sale, not to help people form an informed opinion on the product.


That’s like exactly what cyberpunk did haha


So the answer is to just shell out the money and hope it's good? Sound logic there.


Classic DOOM moment:


It's because demos/slices for things like E3 are more 'statements of intent'. For titles without a publisher it was a way to hopefully secure one and generally drum up interest for your in production title.
The reality of game development is you have a finite runway and eventually you HAVE to ship... Cutting features, reducing fidelity to be performant etc is the unfortunate reality of getting a game out the door.
Making demos sucks because so much of it is throwaway work and you have 'ermagahd downgrade' narrative to deal with from expert gamers, that time and resources is way better spent on the actual game.


Would love if games had 50% less "content" but 50% more focused, enjoyable experience to... experience. There's obviously a huge market for shitty open-world implementations, but I'd take a much smaller but lively world over generic, boring, mass produced content.


that's not what OP is referring to though -- that's not a playable demo someone would be able to experience themselves before buying.

obviously still just as shitty on their end.


Thats called a vertical slice and that kind of demo trash is par for the course at trade shows. You will never be able to play them but they will play them behind closed curtains. I remember Max Payne 3 vertical slice at GS managers conference (either 2010 or 2011) and it was very close to the final game only with a few visual issues, we did not get to play it but clearly somebody was.


This is exactly what happened with Forspoken. There was so much hype and then the demo came out and the hype died almost immediately. Unfortunately I think most studios will take that as a warning sign to not do demos and just get as much release day money they can.


Honest question. Why exactly are you pre-ordering a game anyways? A pre-order isn't a go fund me, they are going to make the game with or without preorders. Almost all games can be downloaded now so there isn't risk of a game selling out. I don't understand the point of pre-ordering in 2023.


I see, thank you


The Monster Hunter demos are usually harder than almost everything in the actual game since you have to fight late game monsters with beginner gear that's usually poorly optimized. Still a ton of fun, but demo Magnamalo from Rise and demo Valstrax from Generations Ultimate were both absolutely brutal.


I had really no desire to buy Rise, played the demo and immediately bought it.
I really wish more studios offered this.


God, I've spent way too much time on Street Fighter 6's character editor fantasizing about what my avatar will finally look like when the game comes out in June.


Yeah, back before they sucked, Extra Credits did a video on demos.

Basically the upshot was that even as a theoretical exercise, releasing a demo of a game is a bad idea, because the outcomes favor players avoiding a game. If the demo is something the player considers good, it can convince a player to buy your game. But it can also give players enough of your game that they've had their fill of the gameplay loop and move on to the next game. And of course if the demo is bad, it can convince players who were going to buy your game not to, and turn off players on the fence entirely.

And it's far more likely that you're going to release a bad demo for a good game than it is for you to make a good demo from a bad game.

It's a net loss no matter how you slice it.


This was the main problem.  If you are downloading a demo you are already interested in the game, the demo can only really turn you off of the game at that point.  It bogged down development and didn't have much up side towards sales so they stopped doing that.  It's much easier to market the fantasy of how the game is supposed to make you feel than how it actually feels.  Especial the mid-tier titles.


Yeah same i was gonna buy it but after the demo it didn't click for me.

I'll probably wait till its like $20 in a years time.


Thank god there was a forsaken demo though right? Saved me flushing £60 down the drain


I wasn’t expecting much but the Saints Row free play weekend turned me off the game entirely.


This is a good thing though. Not for greedy asshole companies of course but for the consumer.


people get FOMO too much for this sadly


> Copies don't sell out

I genuinely have run into multiple cases of games I wanted physically selling out, or at least versions of the game I want selling out.

Even a few generic basic mass produced copies have sold out on me in the modern era, games I fortunately did pre-order, and if more rare/niche games sell out the only options to get a copy were either waiting weeks for restocks if you're lucky or the game going for a higher cost second hand.

Sure stuff like Call of Duty isn't selling out, but claiming that no games sell out of any of their options isn't the case.


Yea, except we can now refund anything up to the release date.


Occasionally things are cheaper to pre-order. That said, I’d only preorder that for things like a dlc that I know I’m going to buy regardless. For a new game, always wait for the release


I agree in most part but I have pre ordered all resident evil games in recent years and have always been glad I did, in saying that I could have waited and just got it after release for the same price but I certainly didn't regret pre ordering any of them even re3 which is regarded as the worst.


It also made a difference when the game came on a physical cartridge and that was it. If the game was a buggy mess, you were either willing to deal with the bugs or you weren’t. You weren’t going to get a better experience by waiting.

Now there’s a pretty good chance that the version of the game a year from launch is much better than the launch version.


This. I have no idea why people pre-order digital games.


Hell, the reviewers for Cyberpunk only recieved review copies of the PS5/Xbox X versions of the game.

They didn't recieve copies of the PS4/Xbox 1 versions, even though the supply issues at the time meant that the majority of players would've _had_ to get those versions of the game.

And it was the PS4/Xbox 1 versions of Cyberpunk that had the most egregious bugs. 

The other versions had bugs too, don't get me wrong, but the PS5/Xbox X versions were able to compensate by having much better proccessing and graphics capabilities. So the the versions of the game reviewers got weren't as likely to be heavily affected by bugs.


Braindead.


Genuine question. How are you a patientgamer but also pre-order things? Seems like quite the duality.


I’ll get digital on anything but switch. I want to keep my games physical because they haven’t learned to use a single digital store for all consoles yet. Or backwards compatibility.


>I would prefer everyone just play the games instead and come to their own conclusions.

There's too many games to play each one individually, not to mention the expense. A reputable reviewer is a very good way to quickly sift through the pile. If a reviewer you know you usually agree with says it's absolute garbage, you just saved a lot of time.

Also with some games you don't realize the game is bad because they do an extra-long tutorial to try and force you to keep their game. They make false promises about the endgame, by which time you cannot refund, and that turns out to be a lie. And so on. A reviewer would be able to help you skip these, whereas if you experienced them yourself, you would end up losing money and handing the profits over to unscrupulous companies who literally lied to you. If you allow this to become the norm, the quality of games will just keep declining. This is not a good solution.

Like I said, find a GOOD, reputable reviewer. One you know does a good job without much of an agenda, and who can stay mostly objective. For example, I quite like ACG, they do good and to the point reviews. Not perfect, but I've yet to see them give an excellent score to something I consider garbage, or vice versa. If you have 5 reviewers you trust and agree with most of the time, based on games you did play, and all 5 of them say it's a masterpiece, it probably is. And if they all agree its a mediocre game at best, it probably is too.


EA has been doing this for years with Battlefield. It still releases as a broken mess.


Diablo 4.


I played a little bit of Watch Dogs on 360, but it never really caught on for me.. Not sure why. Haven't played the 2nd game, either


Which brings us back to them focusing on the demo content.  
You're also describing most games that are in early access. You buy into the game early, get access to the game that they have done. There's no guarantees though that the game will ever be completed or even improve.


Why would you confidently say that? I had a great time with the betas and I'm excited af for D4.


Then you are only left with either pirating or watching gameplay videos on youtube. 

Back then a demo pretty much resembled the gameplay as it was in the game. Often they just gave you one level to play through. Then some defects didn't show up either. But back then games where more finished than today.


Going full circle


I remember back in the shareware days, often the first/free episode was the best part of the game (Commander Keen 4 for example)


Metal Gear Solid 2 used it to good (or bad) effect. The demo is essentially the first chapter of the game, and you use Solid Snake, a certified badass and hardened veteran from the previous games.

Then the rest of the game is played as Raiden, a babyface rookie with marital issues.


Yeah would it be great if every game had a demo that represents the final product well? Absolutely! 

Will we get that? Absolutely not!


We do remember and it exactly was representative of final product with only minor changes. Get a grip on our reality, not your fanfic, kid.


did cyberpunk have a playable demo?


The game that’s so solidly written that it can run on a refrigerator? Or one of its successors?


???


He was talking about the comment he replied to saying devs would just focus on the demo and wouldn't change anything about the unpolished state games are being released in


There is no point, and that's why they started including pre-order bonuses to create incentive to pre-order. But once downloading games started becoming the norm, it became the *only* incentive to pre-order. 

On the release day of Tears of the Kingdom, I just waltzed into Gamestop and bought a copy. No line, no fuss, nothing. I did not pre-order. He pulled me out a copy from a drawer full.

That would not have happened 15-20 years ago.


I never pre-order games. My point isn't that pre-ordering is good. My point is that if at all a company offers pre-ordering as an option, then should at least provide a playable demo at the same time. Otherwise it's paying for an empty promise, not a product.


I’ve preordered 3 games ever; all 3 were basically because preorder allowed you to download the game before release to start playing straight away (rather than have a 4+ hour delay as everyone and their granny tried to download it all at once). 2 of them actually came with early access (2-3 days) as well, and 2 of them came with bonus (mostly cosmetic) upgrades too.


I like collectibles and artwork books lol


It just isn't a lot of money man. I don't give a shit about some nerd crusade I can spend 60 bucks, be dissapointed and move on with my life.

Who gives a shit about what message it sends? The whole point of video games are that they don't matter.


I thought preorders come discounted? Even then whats the point cos you will eventually find those games at 80% off in 6 months at a steam summer sale


Its so sad to see what became of extra credits. They once were a truly informative channel that now devolved into spouting industry narrative and outright harmful bullshit.


You're damn right


I feel like the call of duty free weekends probably sells a lot of copies.

Everyone has played cod before and we've all said "I'm never buying one of those fucking games again" but then a free weekend comes along, what's the harm in checking it out? Maybe they fixed that stupid thing you hate or maybe your favorite gun and map is back?


Meh they never seem to run out of digital copies.  Still not preordering.


Yes, physical copies are still limited but people are still preordering digital releases.


Then what's the point?


But why did you preorder would be the question, knowing it makes zero difference in the end? I'm curious why it made you happier.


Hey, that's my favourite Peter Jackson movie.


Butt hurt


Some people played elden ring on launch, and then to the day 1 year later posted about it in subreddit, the minimum time you must wait for a game posting there. Probably plenty of people who play new stuff and dabble in old stuff.


I play some new games and wait to play some, why are you going through my profile lol


Some people play games when they release and then wait on others. It's not always absolute.


Human discovers that other humans can do multiple things.


> If a reviewer you know you usually agree with says it's absolute garbage, you just saved a lot of time.

Except for when it isn't absolute garbage. But I dare not point fingers at piles that others would call garbage, so I rest my case there at that only point.


D4 had two completely **free** demo/beta weekend.


I liked the first game on PS3, but bought the second on X1 and couldn’t get into it either. GTA’s standards are just too high.


I think the game is really good! But, it looked nothing like the E3 trailers, and was quite disappointing. Looking past all that though, it's a great game.


But problems like what Cyberpunk had _couldn't_ be fixed by polishing up the first 10-15% of the game in time for the demo.

The bugs that game had were due to major errors in the basic code of the game. Because the errors tended to be about how characters and NPCs interacted with the world.

You couldn't fix errors such as model textures being overlayed on characters incorrectly, characters randomly T posing, or police officers randomly teleporting just by focusing on the first 10-15% of the game.

Not unless you seriously stripped down the amount of NPCs and content during the first 10-15% of the game. Doing that would make errors less likely to appear, but it would also make the game less appealing because it would feel empty.

Especially if the demo actually _was_ the first 10-15% of the game with code that prevented you from accessing the other 85-90% of the game until launch.


Not one thing specifically. Couldn't break environmental objects, I only played necromancer but hours later I found out it was a bug. Graphically it was the same as D3. It honestly felt like it was D3 version 2.0. That's just scratching the surface, I only played 3-4 hours but I can't justify a full price tag for something that feels like it's really only worth $20.


My favorite demo back in the day was Medal of Honor. The whole first level/chapter was available. Brilliant opening to the game. And the rest of the game was even better. At least that's how I remember it.


> with marital issues

He wasn't married, and on top of that, >!founds out his relationship was a lie by the Patriots. Becomes a extreme certified BADASS though in MSG4/R. Even in MSG2, he did some awesome shit, literally taking on bunch of Metal Gear Rays by himself, killing a Exosuit Warharden Snake brother, Raiden is extremely green but pulled just as worthily things as Solid Snake did in the original Metal Gear!<


Raiden is only a rookie as far as being in FOXHOUND. Raiden was literally a child soldier since age 6.


No but the entire first few hours of the game are extremely noticeably better than the rest, and those were the hours of the game that were showcased in nearly every pre-release hype promo.


Not one that was released but they had multiple demos they played for people affiliated with media to get hype for the game


It’s not about how well it was written, it’s because it was written in C and the source code is available online which makes it incredibly easy to port. 

Combine that with it having almost no hardware requirements, almost any sort of computer can run it. Your smart fridge probably has better specs than your computer from 1993 anyway lol


I have never and will never, pre-order a game. With the shit that, especially so-called AAA, studios have pulled the later years, there's no chance in hell I'm giving the money before I KNOW what I get. They half ass it, focus more on how to rip consumers off with their in game casinos, rather than making it playable and developing great content. It's disgusting and I'm not falling for it.


no normally you pay extra to get the game early and usually with extra perks or in game items


They sold their souls around the time they started shilling for Firefall, IMO. Their naked praise for it was majorly off-brand for the channel considering it wasn't yet released and it was Mark Kern's first game being made under his control with his team.

You can't even blame it on the change in people behind the channel, either, because this was well before any of the OG cast left. This was them just losing their way or maybe smelling the shill money and wanting in, rather than building their brand on integrity.


I haven't watched them in fucking ages, any more detail on what the issues are? My kingdom for a r/HobbyDrama post, but I'm not seeing one.


> Meh they never seem to run out of digital copies. 

Sure digital copies don't sell out. But obviously in this specific discussion of "selling out" the point is physical copies. Digital copies don't really matter in this scenario.


There isn't.

But it also means that pre-orders mean nothing for the publisher side either.  If a game turns out to be awful and you preordered, as long as you're under Steams policy (or it's a really terrible release like Jesi Survivors or Cyberpunk), Valve will accommodate.


to be fair. if he’s going to buy the game anyway, why would it matter when he does so? unless he’s waiting for a sale, but most people don’t do that for games they’re looking forward to


I think you're the one that enjoys getting fucked in the ass by pos releases and games.


I didn't realize you could call yourself a vegetarian while eating a cheeseburger once in a while but okay.


During the server tests, which is for their stress testing purposes. There’s no “at your leisure” free demo. But there’s a longer prerelease time block for preordering players where you earn exclusive stuff that will carry over to the real game.


100%. Medal of Honor was how demos needed to be done. First chapter of the game, introduce play style, mechanics, cut scenes, etc. 

Like the game? Buy it and play more. Don't like it? Don't buy it... 

Also, Absolutely fantastic game. They don't make them like that anymore.


Lol that was my first negative thought about this idea. If you only played the prologue of Cyberpunk you'd think the game is gonna be a lot more dynamic and have more meaningful factions/systems than it actually does. 

Trauma team showing up on a skyscraper balcony to pick up the person you just rescued? Only time it happens. Dynamic feeling missions with multiple fully fleshed out ways to complete? Nope, everything after the prologue will give you 2 options: do the mission or don't. Making deals and alliances with various factions that will result you getting different items/friendly locations to visit? Nope, after the Maelstrom mission the gangs are just enemies to shoot.


lol no the whole game was buggy but i enjoyed every minute of that story. and gameplay. i think people keep forgetting how buggy games were back in the day. the issue again is social media and the mass ability to share issues and problems on the internet. demos also solve nothing. alpha and beta testing with tangable feedback would be best. people use these avenues however just to be able to play the game and less to actually provide feedback so its every bit the companies fault as it is our own as consumers.


Wow I never even made it through first hour before thinking the game was bad at release. It got worse? Glad I didnt buy it or invest more time in it


Oh man, "its well written, thats why 30 year old code can run on a fridge" might be my new favorite bad programming reddit opinion. Obviously well written code never hurts, and the og C language being less than obsolete definitely aides, but lets consider something:

Moore's law isn't a super obscure idea. And although people misinterpret it a lot, they generally get the right idea from it. But what gets lost in the idea of periodically doubling, is the idea of just how much that compounds over time. A high end processor from 2013 would outperform similarly ranked hardware from 2003 by a factor of about 30. Now consider a machine from 2020, compared to a machine from 93. Plus, things like GPUs are being put into processors, and on board with other hardware. Everything is gpu accelerated now, modern windows wont run without one. Not to say most things have some cutting edge RTX capable craziness, but again, a weak modern gpu will run a 10 year old game easily.

Hell I'm a former IT guy and that one always melts my mind. Also makes me wonder how my haswell i7 has lasted so well for so long I my gaming rig lol


Ok


>But obviously in this specific discussion of "selling out" the point is physical copies.

I'd say this is an odd wording. It's obvious that YOU meant physical copies, but it also is obvious that you replied to someone who meant digital copies, which indeed do not sell out.

At the end of the day, yeah for physical copies it makes sense, but that's a niche case and it's relevant to say that the norm should be to never pre-order anymore.


Ah I thought the only thing that mattered was not getting fleeced on unfinished games.


Physical copies are an irrelevant market at this point. About 8% of games are physical sales these days, in a few years time they cease to exist anyway.


Kinda like 1 month trials that make you enter CC they know k certain amount of people will forget or can’t be bothered to cancel


well that doesn't exactly work for all the console players.


Some people feel like the general concept of pre-orders once tivizes companies to release shitty products. 

And there is some validity there if we just look at how hard companies work to get people to preorder specifically. They really want that revenue before the game drops, because it could really suck on launch and at least they'll have made some money back. 

So it doesn't make a difference in the individual situation when it works out well. Sometimes it doesn't work out well and game starts melting graphics cards or something like that. Or just sucks. 

The concept behind the post is that if we all went on pre-order "strike" games would be more complete at launch because the game would be dependent on that for any revenue at all. 

Gamers are the ultimate consumers, though, so it'll never happen, it'll just get worse, now they bundle prerelease game time with full progression into preorders, even for competitive games. Just look at how many games are releasing on Tuesday but sell a preorder prerelease for the weekend prior. 

 But every time a big game gets a shitty launch the same threads pop up, nothing changes and the cycle repeats, with even more pre-order pressure next time.


It does matter, because publishers use preorder sales to measure general interest. Two millions of preorders means there are already two millions of copies sold before even launching the game. Publishers are less incentivized to polish and finalize their games before release if they know lots of people already bought the product in the first place.


I haven’t preordered any game that’s been shitty in a long time. Forspoken, Redfall, Jedi Survivor being a mess, I never went near any of those


You can absolutely say that you have a vegetarian diet while eating a cheeseburger once in a while.

The world is, infact, not black and white.


Remember being able to shoot out of the car?

The next Zelda game should do something like that. Introduce a cool ability in a tutorial shrine, and then never allow the player to use it again. Just permanently greyed out on the ability wheel.


>Trauma team showing up on a skyscraper balcony to pick up the person you just rescued?

I hadn't actually thought about this. By the time you're in arasaka HQ, every single guard is going to have a trauma team call on them after you merc them.


It would have showed off all the engine issues however. The T posing and massive lag and total unplayability on last gen consoles. That would have given them a really good excuse to delay it another year and with the full team working on it they might have been able to flesh the content out better.


What? Almost every mission let's you choose between stealth or open violence at the very least, and most also offer hacking/tech (stealthy or otherwise) and/or charisma as a way to get through otherwise combat-heavy areas. Only a few major missions truly railroad you, which is to be expected


I would say it's one part social media, and three parts the increasing complexity of games meaning these more to go wrong.


Can we stop trying to dictate what's "normal" to other people? If you don't want to pre-order then don't fucking do it. If joe down the street does then let him do it. Ffs why is this a hard fucking concept?


Kinda depends what your goal is. Obviously, not getting fleeced is important. But, especially with certain games like the new Zelda game, I like a physical copy. It's easier to lend out a physical copy to a friend or family member, if they want to borrow it.


[Xbox has pretty much the same return policy as steam](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/buy-games-apps/refund-orders)


How dare you presume people are buying other stuff than the AAA most praised titles!

Damn, it really seems here that people forget other games / studios exist.


agreed. the more features you add. the more things can go wrong. people also look at features as tangible things the gamer can interact with but thats not always true. alot of features are on the back end that allow systems to communicate and integrate  with each other.


For the most part people don’t care what other do. However, when others actions effect other people (especially themselves) they start to care. Joe down the street’s decision to pre-order continuously has caused the current issues with game releases. Developers are not punished for releasing a half-baked buggy game. And there is no insurance they will fix it after. That’s why people care, it is negatively effecting them. 

A more dramatic example is driving. Someone driving too fast or dangerously causes a significant hazard and threat to others on the road. Obviously you care how others drive and want them to be safer because of how it effects you. This example is extreme and the risks much higher, but it highlights the main point, “If your stupid decision hurts me I am going to try to stop you from doing it.”


They just need to be angry at something


Welcome to Reddit. Outrage is how you get pixel points


my only real issue is when they have a patreon set up already too. like. no??? thats not how this works??? you've produced nothing so far


In general I don’t follow a game if there’s no demo. Even if the blurbs and marketing pitches (and yes, the ROs) check all my boxes.  

Btw the forum gives people one week after posting their WIP thread to attach a (working) demo link. The interest check thread is where the hype building goes.


Whenever I see an IF without a demo but with a ton of ask box replies and it looks like it's been up for more than a couple weeks, my brain just kinda filters it out as an RP blog.


It’s true and you SHOULD say it! 

It’s funny that the games with the most consistent updates (the night market, shepherds of haven, wayhaven, fallen hero) are made by actual adults with experience. A lot of the other IFs are glorified oc ask blogs run by gifted kids (tm).


I have impression that some people start these blogs to get some fame of being IF game author and get messages full of compliments.

When they get bored or discover that creating interactive game is not always nice and easy, they just disappear... Without a word... Often without bothering to delete the blog. 'Screw all those people who are following the project and hoping for some news'. 

I've been disappointed many times but I still follow some new IFs without demos, because some ideas are amazing (although I remove from following list after 4-5 months of no progress).


This is my biggest pet peeve😭 probs gonna make me sound like a hater but it feels like a way for these ‘authors’ to get ‘fame’ or interaction like the big blogs do but without acc doing any writing


real it's so frustrating. i'm also on IF tumblr and like, 50% of the blogs there have a single introductory post introducing all the ROs (sometimes even with art??), a ton of asks but no demo even though its been like 198282 weeks. like broo go work on writing it stop answering asks 😭


I'm so tired of those. It just begins to feel scammy at some point. 

Also i get that authors want to set up patreons asap to get funding but when they spend more time writing posts/drabbles/scenarios and answering asks on socials than working on the actual game...to eventually get burnt out and make no real progress for months...idk, i get the excitement from establishing a community/fandom and an income source as soon as possible, but it frustrates me when the actual novel gets sidelined and pushed back for months and even years. I can't help but worry that all this investment will be in vain, and that we'll never see the finished product.


No lie this is the whole reason I don’t follow if Tumblr! Then it seems like once the demo drops, it’s very short. Not that short demo is necessarily bad, but when you’re hyping your game up like that I tend to assume you’ve got at least a couple chapters written.


On the forum, you're not allowed to post a WIP thread without a demo - or if you do, you better add a demo within a few hours or the thread will be closed. There's already a thread for tossing around ideas, and if you want to post about your great game idea anywhere but there, you need to have something to show for it.


Fucking. Preach. And thank you for having the balls to say what a metric fuck ton of us are actually thinking. Seriously, it needs to be said and I wish the shit could be curbed


I'm more indifferent then upset about it, but yeah until I see an actual demo, it's hard for me to feel much about it. I usually only follow blogs unless I see a demo, exceptions being if I'm already familiar with the author.

 I'm not an author so I can't really assume, but I feel like I see a few blogs with no demo, but an interesting premise and a lot of notes, and that might just create a lot of pressure.


based


The tumblr “if writers” (in quotes because having a fun idea does not a writer make) often just want the hype!! They chase the likes and the asks and because of that they never write anything—or they’ll write a chapter and stop.


Yeah they just pop up and there's literally no content, just damn mood boards and RO face claims. And when you search up Twine in Tumblr, you see too many introduction posts and then there's just "demo TBA" tacked right on it 

Also the people tagging Twine works with CoG, HG, and Dashingdon tags despite it not being coded in choicescript just to get more traction/views deserves a special place in hell


Everytime I feel like tearing my hair out in annoyance. Like, you don't get to bait me with interesting stories only to clout chase anon asks guys *please* my sanity can only take so much bs of gaslighting 


I usually give demos a benefit of the doubt, but my heart has been hurt too many times in dead hype to give sympathy to care for any new pop up 'IF's. If the intro post is a few months old without any progress I'm yeeting it down my filtered content


Preach! I’m afraid of calling this out because people will say “they don’t own you anything”. Seriously it’s frustrating reading the whole description and ROs, and then scroll to see DEMO TBA. I’m now smarter and check the link first. And these “authors” answer random anons’ raunchy asks on Tumblr while game has no demo. How about writing a raunchy short story in game instead of answering 2748th anon ask on Tumblr? If they’ve no desire to write demo, I mean. Even a short story will be preferable than anon asks. Sometimes they start minimal 3 blogs, all descriptions no demo, reblog each other, answer anons’ nsfw questions and ghost or delete all blogs. Like they make these blogs just to build castles in the air and answer anon asks >_>


I know most of these intro posts are meant to gain traction / check for interest, but it's kind of useless when there are people who will NOT be interested without a demo, no matter how good your idea is. Because ideas are not what they want.


just saw an underrated IF get overshadowed by like 3 NO DEMO IFs I got even more mad 😭 WHY


Years ago, I swear there was a thread on the forum with like thousands of posts and everybody were so hyped and there was no demo. I remember checking in on it several times and seeing people talk about their characters but still no demo! Definitely left me feeling like ???

I think it was about being a witch and their familiar?


These types of development blogs I pay zero attention to but tbh I barely read demos anymore either. I only read them from authors I like, who have published before and that I know for a fact are serious so that’s like…two of them. 

There’s nothing worse than getting attached to a story and it’s characters only to have the author either abandon the work completely or pop up with a new story every 4 months about why they haven’t been writing, promise to do better and then do the whole song and dance all over again in another 4 months. That’s their right of course, no one is being paid to do anything, but I’m just not interested. Let me know when the story is done and ready for release.


It's weird how much time, effort and/or money some people can put in a project without directing any significant amount towards the main part. Yeah, cool that you have all that art and (maybe) fleshed out characters before even having the prologue, but I feel like the priorities should be reversed.


My eternal pet peeve is when people recommend games and they turn out to be WIPs, which is 95% of the time.


One thing i also hate when people post on tumbrl and have no demo is that some of them are like "im working on it" "almost finished" "can't wait for you guys to try it out" then they give a date of release only to dissappear for months or over a year without posting anything then pop up and be like the game is going on hitaus. Ok i get it life is unpredictable but can't you at least announce it going on hitaus rather then just dissappear.


Ain't no way the mods removed your post on CoG subreddit for the purpose of keeping the community "safe"


I admit I cannot be mad at the implicit market strat of building hype for potentially no-returns on investment. It happens. It also happens *to work* terribly well.

There is of course a lead weight of boredom and disappointment when all you get are snippet *like* reveals through answered anonymous posts and there is, as you have stated, "no demo" to corroborate any literal extenuation of what the plot presents.

I will use an extreme example of goodness, and let any individual fill in the gaps with their experiences.

**A Tale of Crowns**.

by **cherry**

* They field and answer questions without giving away too much, but also a fair majority of the author's responses are satisfying in their own respect.
* Their current game, functionally, both "a demo" and a current work-in-progress, is one of the heaviest measures of fantasy and romance that refuses to grind down their narratives into caricatures of sex-starved vessels awaiting hand-and-foot on the correct accumulation of player-character choices (which in **IF** is not impossible, just a tangent away from being almost antithetical, whether for simple adventure, fantasy, romance, etc. mix-n-match).
* They don't funnel every oversensitive critique from fielded questions into their plot, but they already have a predetermined mindset about...*everything* in their story and won't capitulate to mob mentality anonymous questions (which happens coincidentally in a lot of these "no demo" cases)

Now, this may be an unfair case to utilize, but as it stands, games on par with **A Tale of Crowns**, being both unfinished and still "a demo", but also a current work-in-progress, and still being available to cruise through likely myriad obscene plot-questions, you can perhaps appreciate in your mind all of the *other* cases which intimate that an author perhaps spends twenty-of-twenty-four hours a day on *tumblr* answering questions all the while still having "no \[verifiable\] demo" to bear.

Also just possible their test-users are a select group of private friends, family, or particular acquaintances, and said authors like to...*use* most of their for *tumblr* posts (which makes very little progress and sense) but okay.


I lmfao at this post XD OP you spoke nothing but truth here today. I hadn't even been on Tumblr before I got into these games. I just vaguely knew it was another social media platform out there and only signed up now to keep up to date with updates, release dates, extra content etc. 

That site is super weird and I have barely any idea how it works. It doesn't seem to work like any other social media sites, apps and platforms so it's very hard to navigate and make heads or tails of. Also interaction seems to have its own set of unspoken rules I'm clearly not aware of. So maybe this type of interaction is one of those things us outsiders don't get? Man, that site just makes me feel old XD 

Also I do get there's a lot of work that needs to be done for this kinda games so it makes sense why some writers take a while to update us on stuff. I haven't come across writers with Patreon set up with no demo but if there are, they are for sure laughing all the way to the bank XD I have seen profiles for stories that are supposedly "about to come out" where there's a ton of Q&A type of interaction but 0 substance or content related to the supposed game tho. Those are annoying but you know, like you said, life happens. I wish they'd update us on the game but oh well not too broken up about it all as there's no way I'd ever become a patron for any of this type of profiles and/or games. Stop supporting people who do this so that they stop doing it.


So true. I divulged in IF tumblr for a while and followed a lot of accounts that had very interesting premises! But lots of them either just disappeared completely before the DEMO could drop or are only answering asks after dropping just a CRUMB of a demo. And I get wanting to generate hype around your IF but when there is almost no game existing to be hyped about and I am only getting glimpses of what COULD BE, it quickly turns me off. Now I don’t even bother following an IF on tumblr until it has at least a considerable lengthy demo or the author is at the very least updating the game rather than playing RO the sims thru asks.


I can’t tell you how disheartening it is to read a story with a really interesting premise just to have it say TBA….like whyyyy😫


You're 1000% right. And then when the demo does come out, its something tiny like 3K words, or barely past the character creator. Writers shouldn't put intro posts up unless they have something concrete that readers can assess.


Lmaooo ur replies have me in tears!!! but yh I agree 100% like I don’t get how ppl are still sending in asks when it’s been 3452 weeks like this wip is dead bffr😭


I have to agree, it's annoying, and it is weird how they can be answering all these anonymous asks and yet haven't even bothered with the demo.


 All of this. If there is no demo OR the demo is super short (6-8k words or less), I’m just not playing it. Have got too invested in WIPs that the authors “are still working on” or “I haven’t abandoned it guys, really!!” but it’s been 5+ years with not a single update to add more to that list. 

I understand writers being excited to get their ideas/work out there and start building fandom and hype, but I really feel like if you don’t have your prologue + Chp 1, (and maybe even 2 )either written or at least planned out, you shouldn’t be releasing a demo or making a blog about it.


I would agree with this its just sad getting hyped for content then to get let down HARD. Amongst my tumblr follows I can gurantee 80% of them are Demo TBA. The once with demos that I can defend are "good" with authors putting sweat and tears into are "THE EXILE" and "Uroboros-IF" legit the Uroboros author isnt opening any Kofi or Patreon and use their own savings for stuff like art and character profile (They're also damn good) plus the demo was colorful tbh so it make some sense why it took time to come out.


Shoutout to Paul Wang

The Infinity Saga author's website is goddamn amazing. Dude posts free side stories and Reports on War there monthly while also working on what I consider to be the best written IF game alongside Fallen Hero.

Here's the website for anyone interested
https://cataphrak.com/

Also he regularly posts a guide called ''Creator's Guide to  Writing and Worldbuilding'' for free which is an excellent resource. That man is a treasure

He is also working on a new game Burden of Command on the side which is close to done yet has revealed nothing about it.


Im new to this whole Hg/CoG reddit thing, what are IF'S?


that's what tf I'm saying like??? HELLO 😭😭😭


To be fair, the good ones have good extra content on there. 

Fallen Hero and Wayhaven are the ones I really know about. If ya have the disposable cash and interest, it can be worth some time.


damn at least you read the Intro page/s I immediately look for a link 😭🫡


not the RP blog 😭🤭


It's funny that in IF community on Tumblr no one sees the problem.


Not gonna lie, some of the ones I hate the most are the ones with actual breadcrumbs of an amazing story that seem to string us along like The Abyssal, War of Heirs, and Virtue’s End. A prologue and 2 chapters (if we’re lucky) and we won’t see anything else for 3 goddamn years cuz rewrites rewrites rewrites. Like holy shit, I get not being happy with it and wanting to make changes, and I get writing an IF is harder than writing and actual book but what the fuck.

Also, shoutout to Path of Martial Arts! Dude is goddamn up there with the rest in how consistent and good his story is


Lena, Shepherds' author, published an actual sci-fi novel in-between updating SOH monthly (and still answering asks besides), which is crazy to me.


> they just disappear... Without a word.

Exactly like at least say you're done with the project


dang I wish I can keep track of IA IFs but I never try seeking WIPs anymore but yeah!! they finally got the clout and dipped 🥴


It's not hate, we have a right to be disappointed and pissed, because what these "authors" are doing is not fair. I'm sure there were some who actually had intentions and tried to make a game but life got in the way so they had to put the project on hold. But there are so many dead blogs that I don't believe that all of them had to suddenly quit due to difficulties in life etc.


YUP!!!!! 🤝 same thoughts!!! 🤝


"like broo go work on writing it stop answering asks 😭"

And if you tell that 'author' you'll get a pile of hate


FR LIKE???????? "can we choose to blah blah?" "will we get an option to blah blah?" like HELLO 😭😭😭


An author that I follow posted on their tumblr that they are planning on starting a new wip. The original game has been stuck on the prologue for over three years at this point. 

Of course they’ve been very active on tumblr answering asks and making au’s without any actual progress. 

Apparently “it’s addictive to make new games”. 

I genuinely don’t want to be mean or petty but come on!


IT DOES I FEEL SO SCAMMED!!!!! that's why I'm paranoid to fund Kickstarters bc what if the work is mid as hell but the demo was good 😭😭😭


yup esp if you SPILL THE WHOLE PLOT THRU ANON ASKS like that shit gets on my nerves like how about you answer that anon ask by putting it on the demo maybe? 🤭🤷‍♀️


danggg my friend is right that's why she keeps track on WIPs on the Forum maybe I should start doing that 🤭


it's so annoying and I tried muting key words but I ppl tag it w "interactive fiction", "dashingdon" tag like


Now... Does anyone have the balls to say this on Tumblr? 😅


real!!


thanks bff 🫶


like there's noting interactive abt it but it's for sure fictional 🥴🥴🥴🤡


it's getting so common it's overshadowing works WITH demos 🫣


EXACTLY that's just ideas we want work done!!!!


It (A Witch’s Path) is the reason why the forum has the “WIP threads must have working demo” rule.


A Witch’s Path?


THIS!!! I am the same way 😭


IT HURTS 😭


This also bothers me greatly as well 😭


YES!!!! they're like "I'll be back in December!!!" IT'S MAY and if they do come back they just answer more asks and never on a demo 🤭😭


LOL IKR 🤭🥴 I was like "huh ofc they did" LMFAO


That's just the generic removed post message. It was probably removed because they want to keep COG and HG subs completely separate, and afaik COG labeled games are from authors the company has contracted so lack of demos isn't an issue. WIPs are HG related which is why the post was allowed to stay up here.


I'm in the middle of chapter 8 and WHEW it's getting crazy rn


I have immense respect for Cherry and her work. 

She has a clear vision and won’t allow the ravenous hordes of anons with the most inane and ridiculous questions and demands to change it.


well first of all they BETTER not be going to a bank in the first place!! 😭 And you are SO right like 100%!!! and yes you are right abt the "unspoken rule" and the unspoken rule is that you get hate for speaking truth like this bc I'll probably be considered rude/insensitive/etc!!


YOU GET IT!!!!!!! esp after the Prologue drop they drop off the face of the earth too 😭😭😭 but somehow still answer anon asks still 🤨


YUP 10000% this


thanks bestie 🥺❤️ and fr like ???? it ain't an IF, it's not even interactive in the first place, it's just fiction 😭😭😭


yup!!!! like that's in chapter 388283 you ain't even got a prologue yet 😭🫡


exactly!!!!!


I would also defend Infamous w my SOUL 😭😭 I still haven't read The Exile and Uroboros yet 🥴


Ima just add that even the author is handing out Twine resources to use...that author is a saint Im just saying


not the Infinity Saga promo dnndjsjd 😭😭🫡 we see y'all enough in here already 🤭 (/joke /lighthearted)

and I see you with that shade with the "Creator's Guide to Writing and Worldbuilding" 🤭🤭😗☕️


HG = Hosted Games, COG = Choice of Games, IF = Interactive Fiction


oh for sure! nothing against patreons at all, i love em. my issue is when someone makes a patreon for their IF when all they've uploaded is a main post with no demo or anything. ive seen ones where they havent put out a demo but their patreons lowest tier is like 10 dollars. just a bit ridiculous imo.


Sorry I meant that very new "IFs" that only has an intro post and anon asks to back their "work" up and already got a patreon/kofi yet no demo at all

and yeah I currently support 9 IF authors in Patreon (including Wayhaven, Mind Blind, ShoH, FH, etc) 1 on Kofi (TSSW)


Extra content is just that, though. Extra. Supplementary to the main work, and not there in place of it.


Honestly smart. Some stories will have the most enthralling blurbs ever, but then I find myself not liking their prose or storytelling at all. Saves me the interest and time investment.


It’s fun to look at it and then move on.


Exactly! People follow your blog because they want to play your game. You can’t make all these lovely promises about “this” and “that” and then get prissy when people want updates. Words are meaningless without action. Of course by absolutely no means should you be rude to or harass an author or any other general dickhead behaviour.


yeah I was like "am I just being a hater or....?"


Novaturient. 

So much amazing potential that hasn’t been updated in forever and the author has just announced that she is starting a new game as well. 

So, it’s basically dead now.


shout out to the exile too! pheo is putting their whole heart into that fr it’s even getting an update in i think june


oop not the name dropping 🤭 I never heard of these IFs and thank god I don't that would get on my nerves so much


Ayo what did POMA Do? I do be curious 🤔


WHILE learning and porting ShoH to Twine!! GIRLBOSS behavior!!! that's why I'm on her Patreon forever now she deserves every dime fr


this^^^


like I'll get SHUNNED if I say this on tumblr LMFAO


THIS!!! 😭 like whew they not escaping the WIP basement


I'll get canceled immediately 🥴


oop 😗😭


If I'm remembering correctly the same person had a thread for a scifi game as well with thousands of comments and no demo.


Pretty sure that's the one!


Even if they take their time on a demo i would rather they at least post something on tumbrl so that i know that the author still hasn't abandoned it but when they just dissappear it gets me anxious if the game is abandoned for good and will never se the light of day.


>I'll probably be considered rude/insensitive/etc!!

huh so it isn't just me then? I did think that people on there seemed particularly sensitive and easily rattled and offended? I just thought I'm just way too old for that site cause half the things they find "outrageous" I just shrug at XD.

I'm in my late 20s, almost 30, and I think tumblr is run by much younger people. Like younger adults 18-25 because the interaction and communication on there seems off to me, both the way people ask questions and the way they talk in general . Some of the things I've read on there sound like college-age terms I'm now way too old to understand the meaning of XD And should anyone raise valid questions and concerns? Get ready for the mob that's coming after you XD


FR!! Or they start talking about all these other IF ideas that they want to write/are starting and I am like: MY DEAR WRITER IN CHRIST PLS JUST FOCUS ON THE ONE U HAVE 😭😭


Thank u for saying what many of us have been thinking🫶🫶 Naur bc when I tell u I’ve scrolled past 5 new ifs on tumblr with no demos and they have 500+ likes for what??? Selling hopes and dreams fr😫😫


the exile is so good! the demos a really nice length and there’s gonna be an update in i believe june?


All I'm saying is that that guide was interesting to read even though I am not a writer. So it can prove helpful for some if they can set aside the Tumblr asks and read it for a bit then maybe page 1 would be completed


Ah yeah i know qbout the first two, but i didnt know what "if" meant, thank you for answering so quickly.


>my issue is when someone makes a patreon for their IF when all they've uploaded is a main post with no demo or anything

I've misunderstood this completely, then. LMFAO

I gotchu, I'm not deep into IF territory enough to be worrying about demos and the like, I can barely handle the depression of finishing full stories..


yup this!!!!


I'm glad *someone* is supporting TSSW, so thanks for that. My stupid ass got real attached to that one unexpectedly. 

But yeah, I gotchu then. Makes sense. I'm subbed to wayhaven, FH, and Golden Rose, which are all currently thick and well-done completed books.


Yeah? That's why you buy the game and leave it at that if you don't want more while waiting.

I enjoy seeing snippets of these stories from different POVs, extended lore drops, and progress reports on the next part of a series. 

Making these games and selling them isn't easy to do full time, there's not a lot of money in it. But where there *is* money is getting fans, giving them good products, and having an avenue where your fans replace the employers. I may not stay a dedicated subscriber, but I like these authors and want them to succeed. For my own sake and theirs.


yup ik I get entertained easily so I spare myself from that until there's a link NCNSJSJ 😭😭


Honestly, the longer I'm on Tumblr the more I think people follow blogs just to sending and read asks (especially NSFW, lol)


Yeah, I was interested in that one too but I don’t think it is happening anymore:(( The author seems so active on tumblr but I mostly see them reblogging other (new) wips or talking about their new ideas, which they are allowed to do ofc!! but it does feel like the actual writing of the IF is not a priority.


My fault I meant that Path of Martial Arts is up there with the rest of the S tier IFs. My passion/rant probably made it seem like I was saying the opposite. But I was JUST thinking about The Exile! See, that’s why Pheo’s awesome too. How long has it been since the last update, a year? Despite that, they’ve kept us in the loop for all that time. It goes a long way


virtue's end and the abyssal were genuinely so interesting and then the authors dropped off the face of the planet 😭 (not really but like, 0 actual updates to the game so at this point i've given up on them)


War of heirs seems so interesting and I’ve been following it for a long time now but the guy disappears, comes back, rewrites everything and so we just stay at the prologue forever. It used to be wars of the golden throne and now everything has changed from the very first demo


PoMA, unlike the other listed games, updates consistently and the author keeps everyone in the loop.


I’m subscribed to her Patreon too. The woman is a goddamned machine and my absolute favourite on the current IF scene.


I remember they had one for a circus game—again, no demo and many of the same problems as the witch game that in my experience preclude demos.


I just turned 22 in December 😭😭😭 but ik I'll get backlash there since unfortunately ik Twitter and Tumblr TOO WELL 😭😭


*one you DON'T HAVE 🤭


RIGHT??? overshadowing actual IFs with DEMOS and most of them don't even use the Read More function!!! like they got time to make HD graphics but stop for a Read More (ik this is probably intentional so the reader will have to read the intro but still) 😭😭😭


OOP there it is 🤭🤭🤷‍♀️


😭😭😭 not the call out (/lighthearted /joking these are tone indicators)


I really need to read Golden Rose 😭 I saw mixed reviews which made me hesitate to read it


I'm not attacking Patreon or anything similar in general. I'm specifically referring to people who have Patreons or release "alternate POV" type content with minimal to no work released on the main project.


asking what the options for choices or customization when there aint even a prologue yet bffr 🥴🥴


nah i understood u! i just am completely obsessed with the exile and i want everyone to read >:) the last update was in september! around the 9th


Oh I thought it was going to be negative xD. Honestly just got into POMA last week


So I'm not as old as tumblr made me think? You guys go after your own too not just us old geezers then? XD Yes, Tumblr has that twitter energy I agree. Congrats on hitting 22 btw that's the biggest milestone after 21 :)


Not too much on the hd graphics now cause why do they lowkey eat🧍‍♀️ ALSO LMAO wait a damn minute I just peeped ur little Nate title bye😭😭😭 why is this a mood


Lol i am just annoyed by the amount of times where I read a really interesting concept along with Character arts which is usually done when the Game is close to complete then scrolling down to find out that there is no demo. 

It is even more infuriating when the author is super active on Tumblr and answering questions as if the game is close to complete.

I would never understand people who ask questions about the character interactions when there is no demo even out yet


Gotta be honest, i have no idea what you mean.


Based on your flair, I'm guessing romance is your wheelhouse. If so, you'll like it I think. It has a really heavy focus on it. Granted, only the 2 characters you start the game with actually have anything in-depth, the other ROs will have more in Book 2. 

Personally, I cheated and upped my skill stats right at the start. I like being able to do what I want and succeed. So with that out of the way, the rest was just choosing options in dialogue that manipulate the personality traits and it works really well, similar to Wayhaven. Its more about how people react to you and what you say as far as those stats are involved. And let me tell you, you have choices. I made a charming, flirty, annoyingly sarcastic, but personally distant character that gets very serious when it matters and it worked really well. 

I will warn you, I'm pretty confident all of the characters are locked in. They exist as they are and that's it. Most of them are bi, but 2 or 3 of them are straight or gay only. I think straight girls got a bit jipped, but that might just be me. 

But even without the romances, the characters in the story are fun. I caught myself smiling more than once. And I'll just spoil it for you, because it was probably my favorite part, there's a cat. A good cat. Love the cat. Also Beka. I love Beka. 

But for real, its a good time. I think one thing I really respected was that there weren't any real time skips. No "and 3 days later.." or anything like that. The entire story takes place over a couple of days and you feel like you're in control of your character. 

But it took me over 35 hours to complete, personally. So if you have the time, please do yourself a favor! I select stories based on word length and steam reviews, and Golden managed to hit every checkbox for me before buying, and I don't regret it.


yeah, after others talked I got that's where the conversation was. I wasn't on the same page - my b.

I haven't really delved into unfinished works, only really ever caring about well-established authors or well-reviewed releases. So I ended up supporting the authors for Wayhaven, Fallen Hero, Golden Rose, and now TSSW. 

Never even came up with the thought that unestablished authors would try doing the same.


Or can MC and RO have kids
😐👍


it feels like another day 😭😭 I feel I had my midlife crisis back when I was 20 LMFAO but yeah!! when tumblr had the N/S/FW nuke back in 2015(?) everyone migrated to Twitter and now that Twitter is ass some people are coming back to Tumblr but THANKS for the grats 🥺 🫶


JCNSJDJSJSJDJNFNS THE GRAPHICS DO EAT BUT THATS THE MOST WORK THEY DO AND MY NATE FLAIR 🤭🤭🤤🥴👁️👅👁️🤪


THIS IS WHAT EXACTLY I'M SAYING!!!!!!!! this my entire post fr like you get it!!!!!!!


I'm a bit embarrassed since you mentioned that I replied so quickly LMFAO made me sound like I don't have anything else to do 😭😭😭 (just kidding)


now I gotta play it bc of this pitch 😭😭😭🫡 luckily I already bought it Day 1 🤭 😭 and my flair psldkdnndjfjnd N/M >>>>>>>>>>


Just wanted to say that in Golden Rose it's actually straight men who've gotten jipped RO wise not straight women. Out of 8 ROs it has 4 bi men, 1 straight man, 1 lesbian, and 2 bi women :).


can my MC say/do/go to *something super specific that it turns into an essay*


>I feel I had my midlife crisis back when I was 20 LMFAO

That's not good cause that's definitely too young for a life crisis of any sort XD But if I learned anything from my 20s is that everything will be fine just be as level headed as you can be and never give up :) You lost me once again with that nsfw nuke thing (I have no idea what happened or what any of that meansXD) but again I think it's a combination of being older and not a big fan of social media in general XD NO WORRIES for the "grats", have an awesome life :)


Chile not the most work😭😭 anyway I must say I’m more of a mason gyal🤭


I get you bestie 🫠🫠🫠


Oh like that hahah, im sure you definitly have many other things you could be doing right now. /s

Is that how you use those things? Im not too familiar with the way of the redditor.


>now I gotta play it bc of this pitch

happy to help :)

>luckily I already bought it Day 1

Get it going when ya can! I doubt you'll regret it. Especially if you're into Alessa, who was the RO I went after. She's got that cold-to-all-but-one thing going on and I just dig it. But just fyi, there's no romance lock. You can go after several and I'm confident it'll end up in a big mess.

>and my flair psldkdnndjfjnd N/M >>>>>>>>>>

I did an N run after an M run and I simply cannot argue. M has that "chosen first" connotation for me, but N is just a dang peach. A really, really naughty peach.


While that is true, most of the romance development for those other options aren't in book 1. When Book 2 releases, gay and bi folks will have a hayday of options. For straight men, we have Bella flirtation from very early on and Alessa development straight from the start. Hadrian is available from the start, but the rest of the ROs come in so much later.


thank you!!! and I'll try to be level headed haha 🫣 and tumblr nuke is when Tumblr got rid of NSFW bc of Apple Store rules I think(?)


u kno what N and M stans won in Book 3 we were feasting 🤭🤝🤭


yes!!


🤭🤭🤭🤭🏃🏃🏃


> I'll try to be level headed haha 🫣

Great, now I feel like I've imparted wisdom, I really am old after all XD still have no idea what that whole nsfw debacle is but I'll take your word for it! I've already wished you an awesome life so see ya around on this crazy sub, I guess? XD


WE REALLY WERE pls tell me why I tried the a route and I was left starving by the end of it😩 but then I played my boo f and that was cute🥰


Hahah, thank you for this masterclass.


F is so cute my bbg!!!


😭😭😭😭 np!!!


You can also hear the “character switch” SFX between each pose change

Because she’s “switching character”

Also guess how many playable characters you can have on a team


 I didn’t even realize till this post that she was referencing the other archons


Her throwing Mora when swinging as Geo was such a cool detail :)


notice that the audience are from every other regions


Gotta be the most unserious demo in the history of the game lmao


LMAO the ei pose


I love that, for Inazuma, Furina is just sitting there emotionless on the swing. Very Ei-like lmao


She's trying to doxx Barbatos and Morax


I noticed the venti harp but I missed the Ei pose that’s amazing


I came in like a wrecking ball


They even added the character switching noise when she when changed archons


😜->😎->🗿->[REDACTED]


I did not notice that lmao

&#x200B;

No wonder she was throwing money posing as the geo archon lol


Girlboss furina always serves with her posing omg


Her posing as Ei has me ROLLING


The power of water is its ability to take any shape..?


So, the "character switch" sound effect from in-game plays every time the colors change... BECAUSE SHE'S SWITCHING WHICH CHARACTER SHE'S PLAYING ON THE STAGE.

SHE'S LITERALLY SWITCHING CHARACTERS


I got the harp for Venti, mora toss for Zhongli, and the meditation pose for Ei. But what does Furina do for Nahida?


Why is she posing as tartaglia for liyue though?


I don't think she knows about zhongli's financial situation


well, she sure has got nahida's idle animation down


This demo made me smile so much 😂


Lore accurate Morax!


When did Zhongli have a lot of money?


I’m literally coming back to this game to pull for this annoying brat


Truly this means Furina is the best and funniest archon ever existed.

Imagine the same thing but also imitating the Pyro Archon and the Tsaritsa.

Another good reason why it's this trailer hilarioulsy unseriously funny.


lol nice didn’t notice the reference hahaha


so whats dendro archon doing?


She is so goofy omg, I love herrrr😭😭😭


I will say  that she's the most realised and coolest character in Genshin by far, she's not brooding, doesn't have a common outright personality but instead is layered and oblivious as to what she really is.


I didn't notice the poses but I noticed the regional audience change.


So she knows the Archons but >!she doesn't even have a voiceline about them..!<


lmao she is even doing that meditation pose Ei use

guess should couldn't do the booba sword trick parody since... she has no booba... ba dum tss


You can also hear the character switch sound each time she swings off the screen.


Does Morax have money?


I realized the background and the people spectators changed to each nation, but didn't realize Furina herself was referencing the other Archons.


No square mug for the Zhongli one, 2/10.


Can everyone please downvote this comment it would make my day!


HOLY THE FORESHADOWING


The 4 archons: child, serious, lyre, and BOX


Isn't Zhongli broke though?


Ye i dont get this. Why do they only talk about past regions and not future regions? Furina doesnt mimic natlan and shnezhnaya. In Neuvillette voice lines he also talks only about the past regions water (although I know natlan might be all about lava and stuff) ehat about shnezhnaya water?


Where did she find mora?? MUH IMMERSION!


I really want Rex Lapis to fuck her up and show her who's boss


[deleted]


Inaccurate. Zhongli has no money.


THE POWER OF WATER IS


Should have her pop a bottle of OSMANTHUS WINE for the Geo archon


The Furina of many faces


She's adorable! And precious VERY precious!


This is amazing and I’m here for it


I didn't even notice, this is amazing! I wonder that they think of her xD


This is too funny 🤣


furina with a hard rock-


Well I thought about the people of different nations. Didn't know she made a pose of those 4 archons.


But Zhongli doesn't have enough mora to throw them around


Kinda iconic


Furina and her d~~addy~~ragon shares the same passion of mocking and judging other archons.


I wonder if they will update it when the other archons come.


Not even Furina understands Nahida enough to make a more evident reference.


The other archons: You're mocking me, aren't you?


Throwing out mora is my favourite part. 🤣


This makes me kind of curios what every nation thinks of the other archons

Like what kind of "memes" and "pop culture" references or banter is there?

IRL throughout history since thousands of years back you see nations/people making fun of their own leaders/politicans and other famous figures/generals(example being Ernest King the usa admiral in ww2 who was infamous for being "tough, stubborn,non humorous and tough to get along with" so people often made fun of him claiming stuff like "he is so tough he shaves with a blowtorch"

It makes me kinda of wonder what kind of stuff they say about each other


Idk why but I thought she was clowning them


I am fucking *dying* at how extra this entire demo is. Holy shit. Shut down everything, Furina just won Genshin. Dance for the Lady of Fontaine, peasants.


how did you even recognize this? it went by so fast


She really is a Court Jester, she entertains people during trials and she's mocking other archons.


Is that what she's doing? Thought she was performing, and coming in like a softcore "Wrecking Ball" (minus the ball Cyrus swings on).


*Zhongli on the crowds when seeing Furina throwing mora’s* Hah! If only…….


That’s my girl


Slay


She’s fun lol


I quit Genshin impact six months ago and I am thankful to have gotten back my interest in the game in time for this wacky demo.


Is that Mika's brother I see in the crowd?


Furina impersonating Raiden Shogun's Burst...

...Furina has left the stage


I love how the audience is of that respective nation, and they are _not impressed_ until Liyue at the end when she throws the cash.

10/10 she’s the best.


However I am not sure if I should be able to do it 6AM


5 with the trial ones


I like how when switch it also lagged a bit, truly the genshin experience


These trailers are absolutely jam packed with so many of these amazing little details that I never even noticed


Yeah. I was actually focused on that sound effect. But couldn't recall what that sound was.


I was wondering why that sound effect was playing, I guessed it was about the audience  changing each time. Didn't even realize this bit was about the previous archons.


It should be a really decent team too lol


Also this might be the first demo to have actual singing. (\*with proper sentences)


it goes kinda fast I didn't notice it until i saw somebody point it out on twitter too.


Same, I've noticed the swapping colours, local NPC & equipping sound, but not Furina changes. It's too fast/short.


Same, I was just mesmerized with her looks


Same. I was actually focused on the sound effect.


Same, she swoops by quickly so I kept missing that


I quickly noticed with the crowd their clothes matched the regions, even the guards


Furina flexing she actually has mora unlike a certain funeral parlor consultant


It breaks the illusion of Zhongli!


Nice spot, that’s a pretty cool detail as well. Gotta play to the crowd I guess. Also nice to see that Sumeru people have taken a liking to Nahida now


Furina is Ms. Worldwide


I'm imagining Ei watching this, trying to hold back a smile as Miko cackles beside her.


Doesn't that mean she just exposed Venti's disguise?


It contrasts beautifully with her animated teaser, AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH


Neuvillette fuckin’ knees someone in the stomach, I’m dying. Lol


It is. And I love it the most for that


I'm just at an utter loss for words. I will NEVER be this excited and ready for another character again. She's just perfect and this whole demo was ***chef's kiss***.

Furina De Fontaine just has that *je ne sais quoi*.


and it fits her super well somehow


Klee is up there


It is absolutely outstanding because of it


Yep and I just love it . I was almost certain that there would have been a dark twist towards the end and braced myself for it , but nope nothing. I am so glad tho that it didn't take a dark turn like Nahida's


This hits different now.


"Inner peace..."


She actually did the one leg cross just like what ei did in her plane.


I'm imagining Ei watching this, trying to hold back a smile as Miko cackles beside her LMAO.


Raidento (lead by Sara) gonna sue Furina (by sending Kuki) for copying pose of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder.


The pose: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalitasana


She's doing Ei's sitting pose too


She is doing the ei meditation pose


The funniest part about this is how _nobody_ would take her seriously enough to believe her


Already doxxed by TCG


Everybody knows that Barbatos wields a Lyre and Morax makes mora


Sara: The Hydro Archon is making fun of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder! We must send a strongly worded reprimand!

Shogun: And?

Sara: It's... it's... the disrespect!

Shogun: \*blank stare with a frown\*

Miko: Little foxes, gather around for some entertainment! 🤭


What if that's what we're doing in gameplay? Resonating with people's fates to mimic their behavior and abilities?


She leans on the swing like how Nahida does on her swing


Holding to the swing like Nahida's idle.


Watch the start of nahida's trailer and how she swings before the cut to 2D.


Swing, in a cutesy, kiddy way. It's Nahida's thing, remember? At this point, it's her signature animation, from her demo to her idle animation (still the longest idle animation)


She stole Morax's personal piggy bank


She's technically Zhongli since he has a tendency to throw away money by buying luxuries without thinking. Although the money isn't his, he does throw it away.


Let's just think she knows and she's just flexing that she actually has mora unlike Zhongli.


pretty sure he's financially stable. just that he's old so he forgets his money quite a lot .


He's still the god of mora, y'know XD

Zhongli's attitude about money is not so much he's poor, it's the fact he doesn't care about them because it's so natural for him.

He created all mora and deep down, he considers Teyvat mora as his own mora.


When he had the Gnosis probably. He could make Mora as needed. Or it could just represent Hu Tao's money, since he seems to spend it frivolously, ie, throwing it away.


Zhongli is rich he just never bring money


before he threw it away


Nahida's idle animation when she's on her swing


Holding swing with both hands and leaning.


Swing is originally Nahida's


Nope he just never bring money I think It's mentioned somewhere. Don't be fooled be meme


lol


Nope he just never bring money with him.


he technically didn't broke. Just before we summoned by Ningguang thru Ganyu, he buy us a dinner. If he really broke, he couldn't do that. Now, it does left the question who's money that Zhongli use to pay.


But he does "throw it away"


And with the 5th one being put ON TRIAL

Edit: Thanks everyone, my first 1,000+ upvoted comment is a Cyno joke


Furina isn't French...

She's playing Genshin from Brazil


What do you mean the Aranaras don’t use proper sentences?? When they said “La la la la la la la” in Nahida’s demo I rly felt that


And it's in French, no less!


Kazuha's definitely has some shape of a proper sentence.


What if being put on trial makes her broke


Thanks to the Imirsul tree shenanigans, there is only one Dendro Archon from the start that people loved.... Unfortunately....


Imagine for her idle animation to be answering a few telephones — "Hi, this is Furina speaking... 여보세요? う〜ん...はい... う〜ん... 好,知道了. Hm... sure thing".


Nope. Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is also a bard in people's eyes, one of his most treasured relics being the Holy Lyre del Himmel.

Thus the audience cannot exactly correlate Barbatos to Venti because that also opens up the possibility that Six-Fingered Jose is the Anemo Archon.


Only if you assume that the anemo archon is the only being in the world who plays a lyre. And if you do, then he already exposes his identity every time he's in public.


Its Furina's two moods.

Pastries and Performances.

Drowning in Depression.


I thought he kicked him in the balls.


On one hand, the man has no clue how to fight with his actual body. On the other, that's not a bad technique when you're up close! XD


And Hutao too


Pretty sure she's posing on the wrong leg too


The mirror image reflects,  things become interesting when you realize it


Technically the TCG doesn't say that they are archons right? Could be adding them since they are vision holders.


Ei letting Worldly affairs be is just her thing


Sara just clutching her Ei body pillow, sobbing with rage rn


Shogun: fine I'll go to talk to the Hydro Archon (never leaves because Furina bribed and apologized with specialty cakes and desserts)


So when Raiden pulls out the Musou no Hitotachi it's actually just the traveler pulling the Dull Sword from his chest?


Technically none of the characters we play as are actually traveling with us. It's always been just the Traveler, Paimon, and the dull blade.

IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD, LUIGI


Thank you.


Thanks


Thank you.


Appreciate the response.


> tendency to throw away money

throw away DIRECTOR HU's money


Holy shit!


The prophesy is real


No way. If that's intentional then... NO WAY.


🤯


r/ThanksCyno


An absolutely deserving one at that!


is the fandom totally oblivious to the fact that Furina is Marie Antoinette?


160 ping gang


Shitty government, mess of a city, both have great culinary culture.

It checks out


Banger


Mozart been real quiet since the Aranaras dropped "La la la la la la la" fr


my favourite language from fiction...


File for bankruptcy, same thing any wealthy person or organization does when the courts come after their moolah.


Greater Lord [Redacted]


it's so sad that Rukkhadevata died of ligma


That did happen to HSR Topaz haha


Oh my Archon, Six-Fingered Jose is the Anemo Archon!?


And come to the realization that venti looks nearly identical to the anemo archon statue besides the costume.


just like me fr fr


Honestly? It kind of looks like he was trying to knee the dude in the head...


Hu Tao's at least beating up some Fatui. Furina's here bullying a blubberbeast and a small crab.


E.. Excuse me? The divine God of Justice determines right from wrong, even judging the God's themselves! Perhaps the God of Thunder should take note of the *correct* pose.


no, raiden has her right leg up too


your raiden costume's pretty good, but your leg is on the wrong side


While they don't say anything about them, the regional resonance cards however put this into question as Raiden's and Nahida's silhouettes are on the region's cards but then we have a drunken bard and an encyopedic funeral parlor consultant to represent Mondstadt's and Liyue's cards...


Yes.


Would


and perhaps the  pets geinshin  player receives in limited  events.  It  sound like that since in Endoras description on the  Oceanid wiki  it is stated  she  is traveling  with   the traveller


Hoyo has been COOKING!


Can we get much higher?


Arabalika spitting fire 🔥


Who?


Who's Rukkhadevata?


Who's Steve Jobs?


It's her literal voice line, so yes.


Dang I really can’t have an original thought can I


she bullied two crabs in the demo,


Exactly what she would say , 10/10


"Okay, then we could invite Ei over to discuss this matter in greater detail."

If this is true isn't this massive fraud to boost his stock?


> "The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,"

A key lesson in my years in software has been "There is no such thing as demo-only." If it *looks* like it works, then management wants to ship it right away. No matter how canned the demo was, management will want to pretend like it's finished.

I'm sure the people who made the video were on the same page. "This is aspirational to demonstrate what we're aiming to achieve." Then Musk decides to play it like it's real.


And this is why I don't get hyped about new technologies until I see them working in the real world.


They actually just hired the guy who dresses up as a car seat and goes through the drive-thru


This isn’t a massive fraud how?


There’s a reason why every car commercial has in tiny, semi transparent text “professional driver on a closed course”, “includes options not yet available”, or the like.

Musk/Tesla not disclosing that it was pre-programmed and highly edited and inferring it was ready off the line, I don’t know how this can be considered anything but deceptive advertising at least, if not outright fraud.


I really wish I could say I'm surprised. They really gave the average consumer the impression that full self driving was a lot closer than it is/was


This is almost the same kind of garbage as when they preview console versions of video games at conventions, but its secretly a high-end PC with 10x the power running it.

Except this is worse because they didn't exaggerate the visual fidelity of a fun way to kill time, they straight up lied about safety capabilities of their vehicles that could cost lives.

But i doubt American law is strict enough to prosecute this shit, companies are above the spirit of the law in most cases based on idiotic technicalities.

Theranos is that you?


I mean Musk did the same with a robot and solar roof tiles.


Wait? Can we ask what the fanbois think? I'm sure there will be hand-wringing and victim blaming all around.


FRAUD! Say it with me now.


yeah, the same year he also faked the solar panels for the roof.


I’m starting to think this Musk fellow isn’t very trustworthy.


Almost everything Elon does is staged. I don’t believe anything out of his mouth until the results are reviewed and repeated.


This is standard practice for tech marketing. What’s fraudulent about it is that Tesla is charging customers for their unfinished software. It should be free at a minimum until is proven ready by a 3rd party auditor.


Honestly, my Tesla refuses to understand when my window wipers need to do their thing.

I ain’t letting the car drive itself until it at least gets a better auto wiping than my prior car that was 10 years old.


Isn’t this straight up fraud and a pure case of deceptive advertising? People may choose to buy a Tesla thinking they can take a nap behind the wheel and it could end up a long nap.


This has always been Musk's tactic.  Over promise, under deliver and blame others


Thunderfoot is going to have a 30 min video about this, in which he'll make the same point 5 times.


Tesla is sounding more and more like Nikola Motors.


'Tesla blamed Huang for the crash, claiming he was not paying attention. But according to the National Transportation Safety Board, Huang had repeatedly complained to friends and family about his car's propensity to swerve at that particular crash barrier in the past. '

Question: while he had hands on the steering wheel? 

Anyway: I am not surprised. Not at all.


You mean, Elon Musk is full of shit?


Oh jeez, this is like Theranos all over again...


Nobody does live tech demos, and I'm not defending them, it should have been made abundantly clear it was staged.  A good example was the windows 95 demo on stage where they plugged in the scanner and it blue screened.


You don't say... tesla still does not have FSD many years later


Gee... Musk turned out to be a lying POS? Who coulda thunk it?


Is anyone actually surprised by this? They literally had a person sneak onto the stage and drive a car off it when it didn’t work. They rolled a dummy onto a stage surrounded by guys claiming it was a super futuristic robot. Everything he’s done has just been one fraud after another and just claim credit for everyone else’s work.


I've got a 2016 Tesla. Love the car, but it can't drive itself for shit outside of a motorway.


This is starting to give off Theranos vibes


Its it nice to lie to investors like that?


Elizabeth Holmes has entered the chat


isn’t this fraud? misleading the shareholders? this is what Ryan Howard got arrested for in the Office


I do have to wonder why, if he repeatedly complained about the car wanting to swerve at the very same crash barrier that he died at, he continued to trust the car’s autopilot. If my car decided on multiple occasions that it wanted to swerve into a barrier wall, always at the same spot, you damn sure better believe my hands and my brain are operating the vehicle when we get to that point in the trip. Fraudulent claims aside (and not at all saying what Tesla said and did wasn’t wrong or fraudulent), it just feels like common sense to me, regardless of what a video shows me.


ALL HAIL THE WHITE PAPER!


There were articles all over the place with AI experts saying we were 50 years away from the computer that could maybe the build the computer to self drive a car. I am simply flabbergasted at how eager people were to put this shyster on a pedestal.


Spoiler alert: every product demo is staged.


[deleted]


Tesla’s suck. Don’t take my word. Look at consumer reports


Musk better be practicing his deep, sultry voice.


>  Huang had repeatedly complained to friends and family about his car's propensity to swerve at that particular crash barrier in the past. 

Yet he kept using the autopilot feature. 

The car may have been at fault for the accident. But the real idiot was behind the wheel.


What business doesn’t stage demos?


Poorly written. I'm not a Telsa fanboy, I don't own one, but the lidar/radar was removed intentionally to try and design a system that was purely vision based.


I don’t care if it’s not going to become available for another 50 years the fact that people are spending upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars for cars that don’t even have panels that line up or interiors that creek or half worst build quality than something coming out of the former Soviet bloc….. wow! This company can’t even get the basics of automobile manufacturing down and everybody here is wondering if self driving will ever come out when it was advertised? Lol!


I just about got crashed into by a Tesla driving itself. It was pouring rain and some d bag was attempting to have his car pick him up at grocery store exit. The parking lot was a little chaotic. I was at a stand still waiting for cars to pass and back out. This Tesla just starts driving straight at me on the wrong side of the road from about 3 car lengths away, head on. I’m laying on the horn and it stops 1 foot away. Then I realize it’s driverless. The dude comes up……Sorry it’s not working. No shit bro. I wish I had a dash cam


 Elon is a grifter. We have a product that will “in the future” do what I say, he just says it could. He just leaves out the part where it doesn’t work right now. He learned this from the tech world.  And he has never invented anything himself without the help of GIANT groups of people. It seems the US govt is subsidizing his entire fraud which is even more sad.


This is a massive “no shit” moment.

Of course it was staged, were near 7 years later and their tech still isnt functional.


Who gets jail time for this?


Tesla can't get automation working in a one-way one-lane tunnel... shoot Six Flags had old timey cars that basically drove themselves (with a rail) back in the 50's!!!


This just open the drawbridge to a slew of endless lawsuits against Tesla owner, Elon musk. Why doesn’t this surprise me?


"The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system," Elluswamy said in his testimony, according to Reuters.


Literally what Steve Jobs did for the iPhone. Yet he's viewed as cunning and agile.


Ars really has it out for Elon, I'm betting they put in a "we reached out for comment but heard they fired their PR team" notice too


And Apple staged the original iPhone demo. Advertising future performance of groundbreaking tech is commonplace and this post is only visible because it's trendy to try to dunk on Musk.


Elon doesn't care about people and I'll stay on this planet until he admits.


A lot of live event stuff is staged or simulated, it doesn’t surprise me. Now did they do it with the intention of boosting stock prices…. That would be another


Cue surprised Pikachu face?


Buying Twitter was his downfall.


The Pentagon did  this all the time with its Missile interception tests.
Probably with todays systems we would be lucky to hit 90% of the first strike launched against us. The remaining 10% would be enough to wipe out life as we know it anyway but at least we tried.


Ohhhh watch this. This is the beginning of the end of tesla.


Tesla is a paper tiger and a house of cards.


I mean, isn't this why Elizabeth Holmes is going to jail?


So the guy who lost his life in 2018, knew that the car had an issue reading lane and other road signs at that particular place in his regular commute and still enabled the system there?

I am not trying to speak ill of the dead, but come on. If you know a particular thing happens at a particular spot damn near every time, then why take that risk?  It’s really sad that he isn’t here, but his untimely death seems entirely preventable.


I thought this was the case for all demos.  Like when McDonald's advertises their Big Mac it's going to look nothing like the commercials


This was posted yesterday......


Only care about this to hate on Musk because he's not as leftist as you would like.
Bunch of fools.


Well isn’t that special.  

It’s a shame when you can see a guy is a con man and a liar, but the majority can’t see it and give him all the money in the world.  

What dopamine rush do people get by propping up liars?   I don’t get it.  We need to stop willingly feeding corruption.


This should make Elon the poorest man in history.


Sooooo…Fraud.


It’s a known Silicon Valley strategy to “fake it till you make it”. Usually, this is no big deal, because we are not talking about life critical systems. Tesla seems to have tried the same strategy on a life critical system. The last company that tried to pull off the same thing was Theranos. The company is bankrupt and the ex-ceo is heading to prison for a long time. Let’s see how the autopilot history ends.


bro all it says was the route was pre-programmed lol. yall wild.


Y'all ever seen a commercial for burger king?


Yeah total fraud! 

https://youtu.be/_ZYEjYnmPlA


Similar to the iphone demo...just different results


...but mum said it was my turn to post this, I'm telling.


I bet the entire crew of Top Gear is laughing about this.


Apple did the same when they unvieled the iphone.


This autopilot engineer must have bought a lot of short-dated puts recently.


LOL! Prior to announcing he was a Republican the world thought Elon was the saviour of the human race. Even Biden refused to mention him as part of a speech about renewable cars and energy. People are so funny. But also a little creepy and insidious.  Sinister stuff.


Apple also staged the iPhone launch demo. This isn't uncommon...


It would be interesting to see the timing around stock sales by Musk directly around this time. You don’t think he’d be so stupid as to release the commercial just before a planned sell off do you?

I can no longer predict rational actions by this dude.


Isn't that basically everything that comes out of his mouth?


[deleted]


Staging a demo by deliberately avoiding some shit you know is still buggy and being worked on isn’t unusual 

But the fact that it's been marketed as a feature and hasn’t been deliver the better part of a decade later? Oof


SEC, where you at?


Eh. I do think it’s an interesting question but a lot of tech demos are staged to some degree. In the army, these kinds of things are called tanks in the trees. When the first tanks were demonstrated to be able to be parachuted into combat, the demo for the army’s highest brass had tanks land in a field behind some trees. If the tanks were inoperable after the fall, they had backups on the ground (hidden in the trees) just in case.

Cool story aside, I do think the idea of fraud and a lot of Silicon Valley demos are too close for comfort for me.


Elon Musk is worse than Elizabeth Holmes, only he keeps getting away with it. He is a con man through and through. And at least Elizabeth Holmes held on to her Theranos shares and went down with the ship.


Faking in that Industry is common. The Automotive sector has faked for decades to gain marginal edges. Fuel Efficiency, Range, Top Speed and functions. All of this is honestly not that much better than decades ago. Sure, the cars got bigger and comfier... but in it's core function there can't be innovated. 

Even with a tin Lizzy you will eventually arrive at your destination. In a 90s Corolla you will arrive at the destination with really comparable comfort.

Tesla is the Destillate of that "fake Innovation" in the automotive industry.
They had to fake to take the edge, just like VW had to fake to make their emissions look good. 

Don't be so naive to think the others are not faking. It's like a bicycle race where lance Armstrong got caught for doping. How can the others possibly compete if they play fair? 


The whole industry needs to shrink to 1/3 of what it is now. From a resource standpoint one car per household is enough if the money is put into public transportation. And no one... Literally NO ONE needs an SUV or one of those enormous pick up trucks. There are cars out there which are made for the woods (Unimog/Jeep) if you really need it. Everyone else I just wasting their money and the planets resources for their pettiness.

So... TLDR: Fuck the automotive industry in it's current state.


It's pretty standard behaviour with new tech demos. The first iPhone is a legendary example, but you often see new cars that are just a body kit on an old model. Early video game presentations are almost always staged. Any product shown before It's gone through the process of mass production is essentially a staged demo because the finished product will almost never be the same, and the actual cost is unknown.

I don't know the legal framework around all this, but I'm guessing there's just a couple of words that need to be written somewhere special to go from fraud to clean.


Theranos has entered the chat.


"Self driving" was always a fraud. It's just not possible in real world conditions. Beta at best. It can work in grid like environments with contained variables like a Costco warehouse. 

Traffic agencies have banned drivers from sleeping in their "autopilot" cars because it's getting themselves/others killed


Apple staged the first iPhone demo.


I don't think it can be fraud. Literally every product launch/first announcement is an unfinished product they're hoping to finish before selling to customers (maybe


It's all a dog and pony show. Anything you see from marketing is almost all bullshit because it doesn't constitute false advertising so there's almost no legal repercussions.


> If this is true

tell me you didnt read the article without telling me you didnt read the article.


No. If you actually read the article you realise the title is clickbait. He never said it was staged at all. Simply that there were test runs, and that the software in the car was not the software available for public release.


They didn’t release it for another 7 years.  It’s not fraud to make a prototype, even if it’s not technically ready.


FYI the car currently does all things being done in the 2016 video.


It's giving me Theranos vibes


You forget that Elon Musk is rich so laws don't apply to him.


I mean they did say that this is what their goal was, and that it was running on a Tesla, not that it was available today. It was a tech demo. They've said several times in presentations that the 2016 demo was not a representation of currently available technology. This isn't some sort of breaking news.


Wasn’t the original iphone demo faked? So does that make apple in the same boat?


No. It was pretty clear to anybody watching that it did not represent **current** capabilities.

While they didn't go into detail as to how they shot the video, not a single person watching that presentation thought that they could buy a Tesla that day and recreate it.

The response of anybody that actually paid attention to Tesla at that time is "well, no shit!"


Misleading the investors I would guess applies here


Oh!! Like the rest of his existence in/on the stock market?


This is what Theranos did to get investors


I wonder where the video is linked from within Tesla's website (besides the videos page).  If you find the video by itself, there isn't anything to indicate that it's just an example of how the system will work vs an actual demonstration of it working.  There isn't any additional context in the video itself that points one way or another.

The weird thing is, they could have taken that video down years ago and just used some actual footage of a good FSD run.  There are plenty of examples of flawless short drives.


[deleted]


When your demo is so good, your manager starts thinking you are a perfectionist dumb developer for saying it is not ready and it really needs more work and testing


This is why we tend to demo initial designs in low fidelity to management even if we could make them look like a finished product. They're too quick to go "okay this is done, let's goooo".


> If it looks like it works, then management wants to ship it right away.

Nothing more permanent than a proof of concept, temporary solution.


> A key lesson in my years in software has been "There is no such thing as demo-only." If it looks like it works, then management wants to ship it right away. No matter how canned the demo was, management will want to pretend like it's finished.

Hey, hey, hey, now: in Musky's defence, Musk was a really shitty software engineer.


So... you defrauded people and openly admit to it?


Remember when Uber's  business plan was to temporarily use human drivers until their fleet of self-driving cars was ready?


There are actually really good autopiloted cars now. Tesla is just cheap,  and they cut corners.  They don't nearly have enough sensors. In vegas, there's waymo.  Not even a driver.


Even then, always wait for the ‘day one’ patch. Just like games.


I don't like Musk himself, but the FSD tech is amazing in my opinion, even in its current iteration. 

I rarely have to take over from my Tesla, and when I do it is usually just because it is being hesitant about something a human driver would have already finished doing.  I can count the times I've had to take over because it was about to do something actually dangerous on one hand.


so does that mean you're hyped with Tesla's FSD now?  Cause today's FSD blows away this demo.


I mean… this does smell a LOT like theranos, right? I guess the major difference is Holmes actually caused people measurable harm. 

But maybe fraud fits?


It was when Nikola did essentially the same thing.

>According to the SEC’s order, before Nikola had produced a single commercial product, Milton embarked on a public relations campaign aimed at inflating and maintaining Nikola’s stock price. Milton’s statements in tweets and media appearances falsely gave investors the impression that Nikola had reached certain product and technological milestones.

https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-267


Because tesla never stated that the car in the video represented the current state of its self driving ability. They stated the car was driving itself. The car did drive itself. They never stated that it could do it reliably. Never stated that it didn't take multiple attempts.

It was to demonstrate their plan for it. And, while they still have a long ways to go, their cars can do what was shown in the video. Plenty of people can navigate to a location without ever having to take control of the car.

As compared to Nikola which claimed to have a working vehicle and then showed a video of it working but it wasn't actually working in the video. Just rolling down a hill. Tesla claimed the car was driving itself and made no claim it represented their current available capabilities. The car did drive itself but took multiple tries before they got the one trip that worked.

So not massive fraud. But could be argued it was very misleading since they didn't state how the test was pulled off.


[Forward looking statement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-looking_statement)


*SEC scratches head confusedly


Well it has two prongs. Sure, it can deceive the investors but it can also deceive the potential buyers, increasing the value of the company in general, which is good for investors


Hell, [at this point, many car commercials aren't even done with the actual car.](https://youtu.be/VHLtPJnZo3Q) Though, this is neat from a tech point of view.


Don’t worry, he’ll definitely be made guilty and be given a slap on his wrist


It seems like they’d be much closer if a couple of things would have happened - 1) they hadn’t removed the radar and other non-visual sensors from their cars, and 2) if they wouldn’t have been so damned stubborn and anti-LIDAR. Volvo is launching their EX90 later this year or early next with a much more impressive sensor array than anything Tesla has.


Handling the piece of shit roads and associated weather I grew up on made me doubt we’ll have self driving cars “as advertised” until I’m either very old or dead.


The broken window on the cyber truck is musk distilled.


It's almost as if he's actually a bipolar megalomaniac living a very vibrant manic episode for all the world to see, and all the money in the world to create cool things and then destroy them.


It would be if we worked together instead of trying to create proprietary tech. We build the roads, we should build the tech that keeps cars moving on them. That tech should be available to any US company that wants to build a car and can prove they can do it.


Full self driving cannot happen until roads and traffic lights/signs are fully integrated into the system and vehicles can also talk with each other or to a standardized system. I don't see a system like that being implemented at scale for at least a decade. Until then, cars will get smarter chips and software while implementing Lidar to gain more autonomous functions. Partial/conditional autonomy is here already with Mercedes and Waymo. Full autonomy is still a dream and Tesla has been falsely selling this future dream as current reality.


Here's [me](https://old.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10b2zdc/starships_muchanticipated_first_orbital_flight/j49nrc1/?context=3) a few days ago being mass downvoted for shit talking all the false promises from Elon. 

People really believe he's still tech jesus.


His neuralink is much closer to Theranos. Hyperloop was even more bullshit. But people and government agencies overlook those things as long as Elon brings money to investors and the stock market profits from him.


I mean, current FSD is way closer to the video than current Theranos is to their claims lol

I rarely have to take over from my Tesla, and when I do it is usually just because it is being hesitant about something a human driver would have already finished doing. I can count the times I've had to take over because it was about to do something actually dangerous on one hand.


"Everybody knew this was an aspirational video" seems to be the fallback talking point.


I went to the Elon subreddit to see what the circle jerk was up to and apparently they’re saying “it was just a demo of course it was staged”. Funny thing is Elon used that video a proof that Tesla has self driving abilities


How can anyone still unironically defend all the shit hes done?

After all the broken promises and the incident with his kid it should have been clear that hes just another billionaire piece of shit


they are still debating whether or not elon bought google. give them some time, they need closure.


Please, call them Muskrats.


I use autopilot everyday on my drive to and from work. Did it fully work then? Guess not. Does it work now? It does for me.


Let me check!  

\*sorts by controversial, sees this comment  

They think downvoting you is going to make them look less dumb I guess.


I don't like Musk himself, but the FSD tech is amazing in my opinion, even in its current iteration. 

I rarely have to take over from my Tesla, and when I do it is usually just because it is being hesitant about something a human driver would have already finished doing.  I can count the times I've had to take over because it was about to do something actually dangerous on one hand.


Oh the simps are all padding each other on the shoulders and laughing how "Everyone knew this was staged"


My model Y drove me from Sacramento to Tahoe yesterday with 0 takeovers including roads covered in snow. I don’t know what to tell you, besides that everyone who thinks FSD is fraud doesn’t actually have much experience with the tech. It’s not perfect but it’s amazing and even more impressive, it continues to improve. Tesla is a lot closer to a general solution than people realize.


I bought a Tesla with the idea that this would be possible with my car. 

Wipers don’t even work well. Road spray today never got wiped but the AI powered wipers. Dojo my ass.


Thunderfoot has a hate boner on Musk, remember when he jumped on the starlink bandwagon just for the whole debacle to settled without any fuss?


I mean at least teslas themselfs are working electric cars unlike the nikola 1


Do Teslas have an HTML supercomputer yet? Didn't think so.


So he complained that autopilot was bad, but he continued to use it?


Same. But it’s so incredibly convenient for long highway trips.


Odd, I rarely have to take over from my 2019 Tesla, and when I do it is usually just because it is being hesitant about something a human driver would have already finished doing.  I can count the times I've had to take over because it was about to do something actually dangerous on one hand.


Point of order: in *The Office*, Ryan’s plan was to have sales recorded twice: once by the sales staff actually making personal sales and then again on the website. This double counting is out-and-out financial fraud, showing an effective 2x inflated income. In Elon’s case, it’s just a marketing stunt that *could, in theory* be argued to be legitimate. It wasn’t, but was taken to be, and that’s where the case is to be made.


Didn’t Steve jobs do the same thing with the iPhone


You got me in the first half, ngl


He sounds like Hugh Grant talking through a mouthful of poo.


So if you walked into a homebuilder's 'staged demo' house and liked it, plunked down $500k and signed a contract for them to build a house and 6 years later they still hadn't completed it, that would be ok with you?

Musk is an idiot at most everything except for finding gullible people and vacuuming up government money.


To what end? Because it would be a fun challenge?

>	Since then, Tesla has removed both radar and ultrasonic sensors from its cars, presumably to reduce the cost of materials to the automaker.

The article makes the logical leap: because it saves money.


No one prob, all the bad guys have money


Because Apple actually delivered on their promises by the time the iPhone hit the market 6 months after the keynote. Teslas haven’t. It’s been, what 6 years since that video came out?


That’s a pretty shit comparison since it could do everything in the demo by the time you could actually buy one. It’s been 6 years and Teslas can’t self drive as advertised, but they were happy to take your $10k for a feature that may or may not come out before you replace your car.


Living life making everything about being left or right is cringe. No one mentioned that here except you lol.


Or maybe the reason people dislike him for being a scam artist is because he is, in fact, a scam artist, and not because of his political views? Seems a more reasonable assumption doesn’t it? Why does politics have to be brought into this?


You’re using a video from 7 months ago to prove a video from 2016 wasn’t faked? 

That’s hilarious


No where near the same correlation. Apple didn’t end up killing a lot of their consumers or other commuters over false advertisement.


It was always obvious to me he was branding his company as a tech company. (That's why Tesla stock was x3 other automotive stock)

Tesla was developing their own technology. Claiming to. And they do have some of their own tech but it's not very valuable.


Yes. I absolutely, 1,000%, believe that excuse for a man is *that* stupid.


> You don’t think he’d be so stupid as to release the commercial just before a planned sell off do you?

He was dumb enough to waive due diligence when he offered to buy Twitter. So, yes?


> You don’t think he’d be so stupid as to release the commercial just before a planned sell off do you?

I am Jack's utter lack of surprise.


> You don’t think he’d be so stupid

Clearly he took a moment to inbreathiate before choosing the infraction point.


Compare it to bot activity on Twitter promoting his tweets. There's already a known correlation between specific botnets and swings in Tesla's price, always in his favor.


Fuck ya bro, hes a horrible human that cares not about this world.


Lies, damned lies, and demos.


> It is so incredibly common in the tech-space.

It's pretty similar to a video game company showing a "vertical slice" of their game at E3 even in an unfinished state. Then you play the game and realize the Demo level is the only fun part and the rest was just garbage.


Theranos. 

And she basically drove the world’s leading expert on blood testing technology to commit suicide over unreasonable and inhuman pressure. 

Pure evil. Complete and utter vacuum of conscience.

These people will never ever understand what it takes for one to become world’s leading anything. Even those accomplished individuals, an asset to mankind, are just tool for their get-rich-quick scam. 

Disgusting pure trash person.


It has been delivered... I've had it on my car for over a year. You can say the time line for release was very optimistic but the product is real and has been released.

Edit: You guys are hilarious. Someone says a fact that goes against your biases and all you can do is downvote it.


gutted by GOP administrations over the years?


Might be too busy preventing Microsoft from buying another game studio.


I keep seeing this point being made, and while they are technically similar, they’re completely different situations in practice. “The iphone demo was a lie: my apps keep crashing” is a far cry from “the Tesla demo was a lie: my car keeps crashing.” 

The Tesla fudgery is actually dangerous, which is not the case for other tech demos.


To be fair, Musk is selling a lot of his Tesla stock to cover his other ill-conceived wagers, not because he believes the company is going down in flames.


I always love the “here’s my opinion as if I know the field… jk I actually don’t know anything about this but I imagine it’s fine” response.


> I'm guessing there's just a couple of words that need to be written somewhere special to go from fraud to clean.

Tesla was pretty clear with their words at the time:

> The person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.

That was what they said. They made fraudulent claims. They committed fraud.


and video game demos frequently include "Pre-release demo, final gameplay quality may differ" or similar disclaimers. No such disclaimer was made by Tesla or Musk. Show cars demonstrating technology are specifically labeled as concept cars or reference models by car manufacturers. No such label was applied by Tesla or Musk.


I've worked on stated video games. It's true. 

Has it become a con? I don't know. Theranos Holmes level?


> . The first iPhone is a legendary example, 

Yeah, but Apple shipped that phone a few months later with all the demoed features.


Well, the problem are not really the demos but that he doubled down multiple times on it being the real deal. Regarding his huge sale of stocks (pump and dump) this will haunt him. Chances are that this is something shareholders can bring him into prison for but they do not have a real interest in doing so at this point because this will destroy their ability to recover money.


>It can work in grid like environments with contained variables like a Costco warehouse.

They literally can't even get it to work in a single lane tunnel *they themselves built*. They promised Las Vegas autonomous shuttles but gave them underground Uber with RGB lights.

The difference is that  Jobs actually had everything in place to have a fully functional iPhone well within the announced "later this year" time frame.


[removed]


“Staged” in this sense, to be a real comparison, would be if Apple played a video of what it would do with Jobs doing fake tapping while the video played

So no, apple did not stage shit. It was real, the core basics were real, the production was real, the hardware and supply lines were real, they were adding ornaments to the tree at that point. 

I see this comparison a lot and most of the time it is a false dichotomy


Also apple’s iPhone staging doesn’t put innocent drivers on the road at risk of getting killed. 

You can’t compare the damage that can be caused by apple’s lie compared to Tesla’s lie.


Yeah but I never had my iPhone drive me into a wall.


> They've said several times in presentations that the 2016 demo was not a representation of currently available technology.

Source?  I don't believe this is true.


you should tell his lawyers that so they could present it in the ongoing court case we're talking about. he might give you half price twitter blue.

Elon Musk's tweets from 2016 (one in the article)

"Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot 

https://www.tesla.com/videos/full-self-driving-hardware-all-teslas"

"When searching for parking, the car reads the signs to see if it is allowed to park there, which is why it skipped the disabled spot"


Elon said I'm throwing away money buying anything other than Tesla due to the auto taxi my car was going to do....


I work in VFX and in the early 2000s it was normal to be hired to pimp videos of technology. At the time I didn't think about the fraud implications.


> The weird thing is, they could have taken that video down years ago and just used some actual footage of a good FSD run.

I think it's a case of Elon Musk being confident this would be solved soon, and honestly thought they could make good on the promise. But as they got to that 99% point for full self driving, they started to realize that last 1% was going to be many orders of magnitude more difficult than everything else.

FSD was Musk's Kennedy moonshot moment. When Kennedy announced that before the decade was out they would land a man on the moon and return him safely to the Earth, he was going out on a limb. He had spoken to Wernher von Braun, he said he was confident it would be possible. Kennedy made his promise based on the expertise of those he relied on. Musk likely imagine himself in a similar boat. Except rather than rocket scientists, he was speaking to AI engineers. It was bad luck the unknowns involved proved more difficult than imagined (and the imagined difficulty was already a 10/10). It was bad management to continue to make promises when it became clear.


In the real world we call that "minimum viable product" ;)


Half of the time this is how Raspberry Pis end up in end products. The team finished their prototype with a Pi, then someone higher up decided it was good enough and to ship it.


What do you mean by this mate?

I'm curious why do you feel he is defrauding people.


*wait it's all exploitation of cheap labor?*

🌎👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀


Note that Uber's strategy for the past decade or so is to say "we're working on it," re: self driving, while slowly draining their cheap labour of all assets. The only profitable portion of the company is their real estate rental holdings.

Yes, Uber is *also* just a landlord bleeding people dry.


ChatGPT will give us driverless cars in no time /s


Remember when McDonalds said they'd replace everyone with robots instantly if we raised minimum wage? Ya that was like 10 years ago.


Waymo has remote drivers, watching all the time. 

Waymo also has the highest crashes amongst fully autonomous brands. Unsure if any fatalities tho.


[deleted]


> In vegas, there's waymo. Not even a driver.

It also relies on pre-mapped routes with pre-programmed locations of junctions, lights, etc, which is why Waymo is geolocked to such small areas. Outside of areas with that mapping, it has no way to localise itself or recognise the external environment, and cannot generate its own maps ad hoc.

And some kids on the highway too


But Holmes isn’t going to jail for causing people harm, she’s going to jail for defrauding investors. Depending on the details of this demo and any disclosures they made, this could be considered fraud.


Holmes is going to prison for defrauding investors. Even so, I’m curious how many accidents were result of someone assuming this FSD capability was in fact FSD and not “what could be”.


Not exactly like Theranos. In that case, they completely faked test results and used competitors equipment to produce some results and had no real plans to actually develop their product. Tesla actually did drive this route although it was a staged, pre-mapped route and took many attempts but it did drive the route without human interaction. They have also been improving the product and moving towards their goal. Fraudulent, yeah most likely but no where near the level of Theranos.


a bunch of people have died because of tesla fsd lmao 

like even the dude in this demo video died using tesla fsd


Tesla cars killed people because they believed in self driving capabilities.


> I guess the major difference is Holmes actually caused people measurable harm. 

She didn't really. Well, at least not physical. She defrauded investors which is measurable harm. It was fraud, but it didn't cause patients harm because they weren't actually providing false results. They still provided real test results, they just used the standard tests to do it and claimed it was Theranos's fancy new tech. The patients still received their test results, and those test results were accurate, they just weren't produced by Theranos equipment like was claimed.


I mean, current FSD is way closer to the video than current Theranos is to their claims lol

I rarely have to take over from my Tesla, and when I do it is usually just because it is being hesitant about something a human driver would have already finished doing.  I can count the times I've had to take over because it was about to do something actually dangerous on one hand.

They are entirely NOT the same thing but whatever gets you Karma I suppose.


The "self driving" car crashed in their parking lot and they had to repair it before jumping through every imaginable hoop to get a good take, using hardware and software that was not going to be present on the production vehicles.

And if that's not good enough, just a few years later musk threw out the robotaxi BS to boost sales when the company had just a few weeks of cash left. The guarantee of robotaxi's in 2020 lifted the stock and the company immediately sold stock to avoid bankruptcy.

It's straight-up fraud.


wow the number of mental gymnastics you had to go through was insane. I am sure it was not misleading to say that FSD is 2 years away for the past 10 years


Tesla is hell bent they can do AI driving with just a camera. It's fucking mental to think that


> EX90 

I think I'll try a test drive when it becomes available.


To be fair, the reason RADR and other sensors were removed, was because of the global shortage. 

You either build and sell cars without that, or... you don't sell cars. Doesn't take a IQ of 100 to figure out what you need to do as a company.


It's got to be the most frustrating thing to work on. When we drive it all feels so effortless: press the gas, keep the wheels straight, look around. Like, even absolute morons manage to drive good enough. Yet the best engineers can't figure out how to replicate all the subtle constant desicions our brains are doing while driving.


I think it'll come a lot sooner than that tbh. We are already really close, and we didn't start that long ago.


The funny thing is that he had nothing to gain by actually doing the demonstration. He could of just made the claims and shown a demo video. He just made a fool of himself trying to show off.


Child = NFT?


Not everyone wants to make their software open source. It's reasonable not to.


My Tesla can read temporary road signs at construction sites and adjust the speed limit accordingly. Specifically: The normal speed limit is 70, but due to construction they have one of those light-up temporary signs that says 55 instead. The Tesla knows the speed limit is 70 (presumably because of GPS) but adjusts it down to 55 when it drives past the sign (presumably due to the visual cue alone).


Hyperloop was to deter/sway cities from building mass transit, specifically the LA to SF high-speed rail project.

Nice try, Elon. This isn't 2018. No one is buying your bullshit anymore .


When your promos say "Full self driving autonomous cars" and you go to purchase the $10,000 add on labeled "Full autonomous self driving", of course you should never think that it was able to fully and autonomously self drive itself.

It's only aspirational guys.


Which is funny because that's absolutely not how it was received at the time and a lot of people put a lot of money into Tesla stock because of it.


For those who aspire to say “look ma, no hands!” While commuting.


"Concept cars aren't ever fully realized either! You don't yell at Ford when the newest car doesn't come with airless tires and a halo lens wraparound cockpit!"


It's like trying to covince a religious person that God is the bad guy. The believers will even defend horrible shit like the flood.


Wait? Anyone use the tunnels that are now parking lots?


Elon is a complete idiot and all around terrible person, but Tesla did describe this as aspirational as opposed to current technology. Elon just hyped it up without those disclaimers on Twitter because he's trying to swindle people.


Your Tesla has attempted to do something dangerous five times?


Yes, all the cars crashing into things, the staged "demos", and the way they blow up and catch on fire are all evidence of this.

If a company didn't want to mislead the public about its actual capabilities, I'm sure a fake demo was completely what they would do.


+1 here, have been using FSD and haven't had any problems. It's not perfect but that's not what I expected. People assume all technology shifts are step changes, this will take time as it's a really fucking hard technical problem to solve


Thunderfoot's takes on reusable rockets have aged like milk, too. That said, I usually agree with him... but he's such a smug asshole that I usually wish I didn't, lol.


Do adaptive cruise and auto braking work without it engaged? So far those are the two features I want for my kids when they start to drive.


Dunno. It doesn't clarify a thing about it.


2020 M3P here w/ FSD and i fully agree. Once I get in the highway I set it and cruise. However once it comes to off-ramps and side streets I occasionally let it try and find it way… but 90% of the time I nope out for my safety and society’s


The 2016 and 2019 are quite different for their FSD capabilities. But the 2016 was still advertised at the time as being fully possible (including with this video). But it's not even close.


Except he eventually did provide what he promised during the demo… the demo and reality were equal. In this case, they are not. Jobs didn’t sell and unfinished product while Musk did. That’s the difference.


bullshitting people is fine as long as you can manage to deliver fast enough. It's only fraud when your lies don't become reality. So far Elon could get away by delivering something, even though not really exactly what he promised. Now that more and more time has passed and we are still not getting exaclty what he promised, people have started questioning him. And rightly so. If he had absolutely nothing in his hands, that means no EVs at all, he would have already met the same end as elisabeth holmes. If his first business had been hyperloop or neuralink, he also would have met the same end as Elisabeth Holmes. He was lucky that his first two bets (spaceX and Tesla) were on tech that already existed, so it was possible to deliver at least something.


I think his point is that all demos are staged. If they weren’t they wouldn’t be much of a demo. Demos don’t normally just happen randomly or spontaneously. Staged ≠ fake or fraudulent.


Beyond the “market your firm as a tech firm” thing, which many others like WeWork did, he did manage to get to a point where there would be no other electric cars than Tesla. Whatever the other brands were launching simply didn’t register in anyone’s radar. 

Musk’s personal brand overwhelmed everything else because everyone in tech wanted to be like him or be part of Tesla’s success, regardless of the product.

Now that this bubble has popped and he’s been figured out as a yer da type with money, folks are actually seeing that the cars are only so competitive and figuring out that other brands can make electric cars as well.


the valuation of tech companies doesn't make sense either though, they are all way too overvalued. Investors just needed a justification to get fools to pump up the bubble.


x3? Mate.


If he had any brains, he would have signed a lowball offer. Agreeing to pay a premium for a company YOU think is inflated due to bots is just moronic. Dumbest move in tech this century, so far.


"There here is Jon, he's our MVP engineer."

"Most valuable....?"

"Minimum viable product.  But he's definitely our most valuable engineer."


It's not this way because we want it to be. People won't buy a product unless it looks incredible, costs nothing, and they can have it yesterday.

Sales people learned to sell people the moon and people kept trying to buy it.


Lol like how my older gamer brother was explaining to me(someone who recently heard about star citizen and was excited) that is basically been an enormous scam of like 500 million from gamers for 15 years.


Yeah?  You can get out of your Tesla and have it go park itself somewhere?  That’s an interesting “fact” for sure


I love when you state some elephant-in-the-room fact that everyone is avoiding like the plague and then get down voted to oblivion with no response.  I think the highest I've gotten was like -56 with zero comment. 😂

All that matters to reddit people, I guess.


That's the FTC.


Musk made some of his biggest sales of the stock basically at the absolute peak, well before he had to fund Twitter and such.


So 95% of commenters on the internet.


Isn’t the car driving itself along a preprogrammed route?


technically that's what happened - person in the seat didn't do anything and was required to be there for legal reasons. 

They just needed to try many times and modify the software for the shot to work.


This. Apple or any of the other shitty startups that stage demos can do that if their product doesn’t literally have the capacity to end or gravely impact human lives. That’s why it’s fucked up that Theranos and Tesla and FTX lie. There’s always lying in tech, it’s just whether your lies will kill people.


Not with that attitude


It's still investor fraud though.


Well, they didn't actually invent anything so there wasn't a whole lot to do. There were already products that did exactly the same things. He just packaged it really well. Not hating on the iPhone. They've always had the best cameras hands down


The documentary on the iPhone showed they hadn’t completed development.  He in fact stated wanting the phone to do certain things they hadn’t designed yet.  So it was more than a glossy bow that needed to be applied to it.  These cars did end up driving themselves.  The iPhone eventually worked.  The bullet proof glass broke.  I’m sure that will be resolved as well.


It is known that there was a specific set of functions selected in a specific order to not break the phone during the demo and was programmed to show full signal regardless of what was actually going on. 

It was definitely an incomplete product being sold as finalized. And the first iPhone was not an amazing product when first sold. It had numerous issues.


Mine drove me up one. So I switched to Samsung


>was **going** to do.... 

Yes, future tense. That is exactly the part people missed.

Elon isn't the only one who under estimated FSD.

https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/why-hasnt-waymo-expanded-its-driverless-service-heres-my-theory/

I get Elon sold cars with an option for "future autonomous ability" but will fail to deliver within the normal life span of some of those cars. I'm one of those buyers. Still, I got some great features and I was provided as the information I needed at the time I bought the car to know I was taking a risk.


What Nikola did was fraud.
"This is an actual prototype driving under it's own power!"

"Oops, I mean it is an unpowered mule we towed up hill then recorded it coasting downhill with the camera tilted so the terrain looks flat."

How many companies have shown off prototypes are promised future capabilities (with video demonstration) just to delay or cancel them later??

But, thinking of all the times that has happened in the past makes it harder to villify Tesla... So let's just live in a confirmation bias bubble... Don't have to think so much that way.


I made a $1k bet in 2010 with a friend. He said in 10 years he'd be able to call a self driving car as a taxi and it'll take him anywhere.

He paid me two years ago. Because I, as a simple IT engineer, knew about the law of diminishing returns and how hard it will be to get the last bits completed.


[deleted]


from what engineers working at tesla like Jim Keller say, they thought it was solvable ballistics problem but also very difficult and not something they could shit out in a year like Musk keeps claiming every year. even mobileye, once partners with tesla, cut ties because Musk kept demanding camera only FSD and mobileye felt it was too dangerous.

so no, he had experts telling him constantly that it was not going to happen and he just decided to lie, probably because there would be no way tesla could get investors on board for the tens of billions burnt back when they could barely produce a few thousand cars a year unless they thought he was a genius with a multi-trillion dollar self driving solution.


You can use JFK as the example, or you can use Elizabeth Holmes.


> But as they got to that 99% point for full self driving

You're giving him/them *way* too much benefit of the doubt, because they are nowhere near "99%". There are more road types than "highways" in the world that this shit needs to deal with on the daily.

Further, anyone *actually* competent in AI *never* talks about "solved", because the entire point of AI-like systems is getting *close to* solutions that're far too complex to ever actually solve. There's never any "only 1% left until this is solved!" situations in this arena. It's just not how it works.


You only get to compare people to Kennedy when you have some reason to believe they thought they could accomplish the stated goal.

>	Waymo also has the highest crashes amongst fully autonomous brands

Citation needed


Waymo is easily ahead with Cruise close behind in the autonomous vehicle race. The others are years behind their technology and what they've demonstrated in the real world.

Waymo has never had any serious crashes and the vast majority are the fault of other drivers. Waymo has a lot of crashes because they have the most miles with Cruise. So your statistics are pretty dishonest and misleading.


>Waymo has remote drivers, watching all the time. 

So... it's a digital taxi? But they still have to pay people to drone-drive it? Wtf is the point


My vision was for cars to be navigated by a network AI, like ants moving in tandem. Each car would feed its input to create the full picture of the environment. No car will run into another because they already know where each other are. We already have the beginnings of this with Google traffic data. Traffic delays could disappear without rubber-necking or rubber banding. Each car would confirm mapping for the next and the first encounter with an obstruction would be communicated to the rest.

This would require a single standard system and eliminate autonomous vehicles, so not going to happen in the current market.


I'd trust a robot over People any day of the week.


What would be really innovative is to install a route it could follow, something the car could "track". And make it a really big car, something that could hold dozens or even hundreds of people.  You could have several stations along the way, so you could hop on and off at convenience.

This is exactly that if true. Defrauding investors. SEC will want details. 

Was anyone harmed by the tech could be a separate question to investigate.


Yes, they never could prove that Theranos actually harmed customers. 

My understanding is that they always took "control" samples using regular blood test methods, and then processed those in proven 3rd party equipment, to fraudulently provide the actual results that customers received. 

Customers received valid results, but investors were defrauded because it wasn't Theranos equipment providing those results.

Lots, and people are dying and will die because of this if somebody doesn't intervene

https://fortune.com/2022/10/19/tesla-cars-involved-in-10-of-the-11-new-crash-deaths-linked-to-automated-tech-vehicles/


Its not even really fraud I would say, at least not any more than any other rose colored marketing is. The car did what it was stated to have done, there was just lots of details left out


Really? Who? Any link for that?


I think they did pass bad results in some cases. This is what got Walgreens (large investor) attention.


Karpathy's talk points to sensor fusion being the motivation - when camera and radar disagree it's very hard to reconcile.


Did Muskrat ever say that supply chain issues were behind it? Or was he high on his own ball sweat in doubling down on a camera-based semi-autonomous system while **all** of his competitors were going in a different direction?


Even the worst drivers are pretty good.


We’ll see. I’m no clairvoyant, but I imagine it’s one of those “last 10% is the hardest” type of problems.


Is that one of his kids' names?


For some things maybe, not for this.

Leaders in innovation deserve credit where it's due. They don't deserve a government subsidized monopoly. We need to establish national standards and create more open-source tools. 

We can not build the nation of the future if only 4 companies own the tech it's running on and none of it works together. Paying companies to make their services better does not work. We have lost billions trying to improve things this way. This is infrastructure, it should be built by the people for the people.

Not that I’m shitting on Teslas, but my Honda odyssey does that. As long as the numbers are visible, it will continually update a info display with that last speed limit the camera observed. After a certain time without seeing a new sign, it will time out and blank until it see a new one.


Just like the phone company saying you have 'unlimited' minutes


In theory the cars have automatic emergency braking engaged at all times. "autopilot" is the name they give to the other suite of non-safety features (adaptive cruise, lane keep assist). For some reason when the car had autopilot on it did not determine this particular roadway obstacle to be worthy of braking for.


The iPhone at the keynote even had a plastic screen, but it got swapped out for glass soon after the demo because they noticed it was scratching far too easily.


All demos are not staged. It might actually be a *bona fide* demonstration.


Early on Nissan Leaf was out performing Tesla in sales, but quickly that turned around and now it seems the Leaf is nearly dead. Toyota also has had a down turn in all electric sales in the US.

From a bit of research it seems GM is the only company keeping up with Tesla in US sales of all electric cars, but even then Tesla is pretty far in the lead. But this Elon meltdown I think over all will be better for the electric car market in the US. Tesla isn't nearly as dominant in the rest of the world so will have less of an impact outside the US.

I don't really care if Tesla lives or dies as a company, but it would be nice to see the cult like following of it die off, and for other EV's to start taking up some of the market share.

EDIT: I was reading projected data, Ford is outselling Chevy in full electric.


Yes. Not-for-nothing Musk played this game brilliantly. He out played the "Theranos Elizabeth Holmes" con. And IMO may get away with it. 

Or you could argue that silicon valley is using tech bubble speculation to grow stock/bell curve/pump dump/gaming finance.


Honestly, I don’t think that was entirely because of musk. He helps, but It had everything to do with people believing Tesla was going to be the first company to deliver a fully self driving car. Aka a tech company with tech others might not be able to replicate for a long time, hence the huge valuation. 

Obviously they never delivered that


Other brands were experimenting with electric too, they just didn't have a way to ensure chargers would be available and technicians would be trained, so they didn't move to market until much later.

Tesla's early strategy was simply "sell to the uber rich who can afford the car and a charger." Makes sense, good business move. Then Elon got a big head and decided that if he pretended to be "a genius" he could pressure municipalities into installing chargers all over. Somehow it worked, people fell for the scam. Maybe it was thanks to the "going green" look being popular. End result, Elon learns the value of bullshitting and ramps it up. He begins to believe his own lies. 

10ish years later, charges are all over, more affordable to install at home, and battery tech lasts longer / can yield good torque, and the rest of the market releases electric vehicles.


Exactly that.

And the whole thing happening with the automotive industry in general (I'm talking about new car programs being like 3 years long) is because of the market pressure. People want to change their car every 3 years and if you are late to that party you lose so much that you just can't get the investment back. And we are seeing poor quality, less vigorous testing, loads of features that are essentially trialled and tested by the customer, 24 months in service failures etc etc. But that's what people want, apparently. 

And Tesla has also proven that people want a big tablet with a car somehow attached to it. The quality doesn't matter, as long as it makes people feel nice for a bit.


No. I get in my car, put in an address on the gps, and the car drives me there. It amazes me how much reddit shits on things they know nothing about. The hive mind is crazy.


Actually it's 99.97% since all stats are made up


It actually crashed at the end of the video when it was parking. They just didn't show it.

And they had to do it multiple times because traffic intervened. The driver also had to operate the brake and accelerator as the car was not capable of dealing with traffic lights at the time.


According to another commenter here, the driver was operating the brake and the accelerator


Also, Apple's tech *actually worked* when it was shipped. They didn't claim "and it will make your coffee in the morning" and then fail to deliver on the promise of morning coffee...


This is what leads me to believe all the L. Ron Musk evangelists don't fucking drive, and are either edgy teenagers too young for a licence, or feculent 25-year-old NEETs still in mum's basment: they cannot make the distinction between a car, and, say, a beta version of a video game.


The product worked on release though? It's not like they tried to ship a broken product, they did the same thing every video game company does at events like E3.


I'm all for saying Apple is not usually first to any market. However, saying "there wasn't a whole lot to do" really undermines the work that went into multitouch and some other efforts needed to pull the iPhone together.


Driving themselves into children


> it was…an incomplete product being sold as finalized 

False history. When Jobs demoed the iphone, it was not for sale. Being incomplete was never a criticism. And companies demo their unfinished work all the time… with the general public trust that what they say is true

The difference with Tesla is FSD was, and is, all smoke and mirrors

There was never anything behind it and in 2023, with the power of hindsight, we can safely assert the 2016 claim was completely fraudulent


It was not an incomplete product when sold, or it would have been delayed until it was ready to be sold.


Should have bet 100bucks for every year that he can't


“Bad mix of narcissism and engineer’s disease” is pretty accurate, but would be more accurate to say he can’t engineer shit and just pays people to meet his wild expectations tech-wise and rides their tailcoats.

Gotta say, it’s been pretty vindicating to have all this shit implode around Musk. Anyone rational paying even a little bit of attention to his businesses and cult has known he’s crazy for a LONG time, and plenty of people have trued to convince me for years that he’s actually a very smart boy with very ethical ideas. Glad to say I was super right, lol.


Meh… that’s the next tier out. FSD has a solid R&D history, there was reason for his optimism. Still, irresponsible management. Holmes on the other hand had no reason for her optimism. It was pure fantasy.


Good bloody luck on rural roads in Ireland.

The 'normal' lane keeping aids in every model of car I've driven try to kill you with a head on collision whenever there is another car approaching.


A massively overblown ego I can certainly see believing his own bullshit.


From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine. Your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you. One day, the crude biomass you call the temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved, for the Machine is immortal… Even in death, I serve the Omnissiah

I was behind 2 Cruise vehicles in Austin near 6th on a Friday night about a week ago and they were terrible. Blocked traffic, refusing to go through the intersection when they had a green light and it was clear and then they darted out in front of me cutting me off making a left when I had right of way on my green light, ironically I was in a Tesla rental.


Same with alllllll the articles about Tesla having the most accidents/fatalities. They also have the most miles driven and most cars in road. 

But Waymos accidents seem to be more common with pedestrians and cyclists not just with other cars.


Don’t forget. If you put a Waymo car anywhere else besides it’s premapped geofenced area. It will not do anything. 

So the argument it’s 6 in one hand. Half dozen the area. Different ways to tackle the same problem. Both will still take a lot of machine learning


They have remote drivers available should the car decide that it needs help. The drivers are not watching at all times. They average around 40,000 kms without any remote driver interventions.


I mean, with the colossal infrastructural investment that would require, why not focus on the types of public transit solutions we already know work in the first place?


>	On the reg

Objectively, 11 deaths isn’t even comparable to the 35,000+ fatalities in the US per year caused by human drivers. Nearly 100 people die each day on the road in the US. It’s unfortunate that people have died at all, but data is showing that even basic lane keep assist and cruise control is much safer than regular driving alone.


Are you seriously suggesting that they’ve cracked self driving cars, but it just happens to be consigned to a small section of downtown phoenix, and it seems San Francisco too


[deleted]


Tesla advertised them as self-driving across the country and musk even frauded up a snake-like charger to really drive the point home that it could drive itself without any human intervention whatsoever.

Here's the reality:

https://fortune.com/2022/10/19/tesla-cars-involved-in-10-of-the-11-new-crash-deaths-linked-to-automated-tech-vehicles/


They couldn't prove any medical harm. She was only charged because of damage to investors.


But the answer is definitely not to just not include a radar. That's insane.


The comment I replied to was claiming that FSD cannot happen unless traffic signals digitally communicated with self-driving cars. I provided the counterexample that current Teslas (and, apparently, Hondas) can already read and assess traffic signals via visual technology alone.


Huh? I've never run out of minutes. What kind of shitty phone service do you have?


Toyota shat the bed by going all in on hydrogen fuel cells. I think we are going to see them start chomping up big bits of the market soon though. Their hydrogen gambit didn't pay off, so now they are hard pivoting into EVs. Between Toyota and Lexus, I think they are releasing something like 24 EV models in the next 2 years?


It's too bad.  I love my Leaf.  Put a CCS 350 kW chargering port on it, and it would be a perfect family car for me.


I hate the giant Grifter that is Elon Musk and even more so the cult that the media cultivated about him. However a massive difference between the Leaf and the first Tesla model, besides the insane price differential, is that the Tesla looked gorgeous while the Leaf looked like a mistake was let out of the R&D lab.


I've owned both Leaf and then Tesla and both are solid cars I'm happy with mostly.  The biggest nit for the Leaf is the reverse/forward shifter is opposite intuition (push forward for reverse).  My biggest complaint about my model 3 is that Autopilot has not lived up to the sales promises, so I definitely think we're entitled to some refund on that charge.  I still love driving my model 3 and use autopilot.  I just treat it like a teenager just learning to drive though, especially for the known areas it freaks out on.


Toyota didn’t go electric…they went hydrogen and loss big, and invested into pro oil legislation.

That was a bad gamble.


The LEAF held onto the bestselling EV title until early 2020. 

It was such a fun and quirky car :)


I bought a used Nissan Leaf from the Nissan dealership. They had used it as a loaner car but I assume they did any required maintenance on it. The listed range and the actual range was horribly different. Technically my commute should have easily been possible. Practically speaking- every day I had to choose between AC/ heat and getting home- highway miles sucked down the range so fast I could barely go the speed limit. The computer interface estimating range stressed me out. One minute it says I have 60 miles- in seconds it recalculates and says I’ve lost 20 miles- it was so drastic and erratic I sold the car. Sales dropped because Tesla made a better car for that market at that time. Totally agree that Musk is an asshat- but the user interface was astronomically better than Nissan’s 8 years ago. I could enjoy driving the Tesla on my commute because the range estimation consistent and accurate. None of the other automakers were doing more than paying lip service to marketing their electric cars. They seemed to use them to meet the federal regulations on average gas mileage among a car maker’s model line up. They weren’t trying to actually make them good and didn’t keep their electric cars on the lot to show people. I give Tesla credit for making a much better electric car and forcing other car makers to make the electric car market a priority. It will be excellent for air quality in urban areas even if the electricity is generated from fossil fuels because power plants have better air scrubbers than millions of gas cars on the road. Especially in cities- electric cars make sense and now, because Tesla made it a realistic choice the other makers are actually making decent all electric cars. So their were a tech company. Maybe now the other car makers user interfaces and range will be useable Tesla has no advantage as a tech company. I just wanted an electric car that I could easily drive on the highway for two hours a day and charge at home. 8 years ago Nissan Leaf didn’t do that. It’s exciting to see all the other makers taking electric seriously now and giving consumers more good options.

Tesla's stock price may have been smoke and mirrors, but Tesla genuinely was the only general-purpose all-electric on the market until very recently.

The Model 3 blows the Leaf out of the water in just about any spec: range, horsepower, charging time, etc.

There's nothing wrong with the Nissan Leaf. But I think what Tesla got right is that lots of consumers wanted an electric car without compromises, especially on things like horsepower and range.

To be honest, there still isn't enough competition. I can't believe that in 2023 we still don't have multiple all-electrics to choose from in every car class.


What people don’t realize is if Elon never purchased twitter or said he would via Twitter the stock would be 2x-3x what it is.

Elon sold about 24 billion in stock. In the last 4 months. This is the main catalyst is stock drops along with the market hating elon being ceo of twitter.


All he really had to do was stay off twitter...


In fairness to him, Tesla makes a product that people use and like on a pretty massive scale, while Theranos was never able to make anything worth a damn.

I agree that the Theranos comparison can be made concerning the "self-driving" piece of the puzzle.  Unlike Theranos, it could be impossible to prove he knew the tech didn't and wouldn't work when he told investors it would.

Feels like he lied to investors and actually lied to _customers_ (which even Holmes wasn't convicted of), but I wouldn't bet that they can make anything stick.


His story is still unfolding. If he stopped doing stupid shit he might get away with all the stuff he's done so far but there's no telling how much more stupid shit he might do before he gets to the end of his story.

They just need to grow themselves out of it, the monetization will figure itself out!


>Or you could argue that silicon valley is using tech bubble speculation to grow stock/bell curve/pump dump/gaming finance.

This is what INVESTORS and HEDGE FUNDS are doing with Silicon Valley, not Silicon Valley itself necessarily. But otherwise I think this is accurate. 

Any sort of boom is predicated on the presumption that a tech company will make a product worth a damn. The vast majority of even SUCCESSFUL ones (Uber, Snapchat, AirBNB, Twitter to name a few) are on borrowed time as far as profitability goes. They were only propped up by investors and very soft taxation laws.


Did you read the article or watch the demo?


I hope Elon sees this bro.


The more I hear about this car, the more of a shitshow it appears to be.


yeah, i think that's the crux,   
apple went: "this is what it'll look like when we ship it" which is a very clear demo  
tesla went: "this works, see?" when it didn't when it was shipped. it was just a hard lie to prop the stocks.


Yeah, maybe I overstated it. There was a lot of software work that needed to come together to integrate everything. I use android but I can't deny they just plain work well. I just meant a lot of the heavy lifting had already been done by multiple different companies that they kind of claimed credit for.


Sadly the best video was taken down, but you must have missed the super cut of Musk promising FSD "next year" for almost 10 years.

I drove in one in Pittsburgh back when they were working on it with Carnegie Mellon engineering. There was a driver in the driver seat and and engineer in the passenger seat with a laptop capturing all the data. There was a screen in the back giving a live view of what the LiDAR was sensing and seeing. It was super cool. Driver was in the drivers seat but he wasn’t touching the steering wheel or pedal it was fully self driving and in Pittsburgh that’s pretty impressive as their roads are pretty fucked up


It killed somebody that the car saw and would have stopped. If they didn’t disable that feature.


Your link mentions the number of crash *reports* rather crashes.

From NHTSA:

>	Manufacturers of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles with limited data recording and telemetry capabilities may only receive consumer reports of driving automation system involvement in a crash outcome, and there may be a time delay before the manufacturer is notified, if the manufacturer is notified at all. In general, timeliness of the General Order reporting is dependent on if and when the manufacturer becomes aware of the crash and not on when the crash occurs. **Due to variation in data recording and telemetry capabilities, the summary incident report data should not be assumed to be statistically representative of all crashes.**

>	For example, a Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle manufacturer with access to advanced data recording and telemetry may report a higher number of crashes than a manufacturer with limited access, simply due to the latter’s reliance on conventional crash reporting processes. In other words, it is feasible that some Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicle crashes are not included in the summary incident report data because the reporting entity was not aware of them. Furthermore, some crashes of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles with limited telematic capabilities may not be included in the General Order if the consumer did not state that the automation system was engaged within 30 seconds of the crash or if there is no other available information indicating Level 2 ADAS engagement due to limited data available from the crashed vehicle. By contrast, some manufacturers have access to a much greater amount of crash data almost immediately after a crash because of their advanced data recording and telemetry

Emphasis mine.


Interesting that a very significant chunk of those resulted in rear end damage on the autonomous vehicle. Usually means someone else was following too close.

Maybe I missed it, but I'm curious how those numbers compare when adjusting for per miles driven, and how they compare to human drivers. They don't have to be perfect, just better than us.


That's a raw number of crashes, it's not adjusted for miles driven or number of cars on the road. Waymo drives more miles per week than many of these companies do in a year, it's not a fair comparison.

From the NHTSA (the agency that provided your source): "[Milage] information is held by manufacturers and not currently reported to NHTSA,” the agency stated. “Thus, these data cannot be used to compare the safety of manufacturers against one another.”


Apples and oranges. Tesla has 0 miles self-driving. Waymo and Cruise have actual miles with no safety driver.


I'd rather a car not drive outside a safe zonr and hurt noone at all then pretend to drive and hurt multiple people.


Waymo is self-driving in geofenced areas, and Tesla is self-driving nowhere. So no, it's not the same, and most experts in the field know that. You can go to /r/SelfDrivingCars and get laughed out if you think Tesla's approach is promissing.


All of the strip in vegaas is being utilized for self driving vehicle... lol


its intentionally designed that way. the sec doesnt do anything because rich people own the system. unless a rich person does something so egregious that the sec has to act. the "deepstate" would assassinate whatever political leader tried to defang the doj


They couldn’t or didn’t care. You don’t need to cause physical harm to be criminal. Assault doesn’t need someone to hit you. What she did was reckless and committed medical fraud several hundred times… but the only reason any of this is happening to her is because she took from the rich and more importantly than money made them all look dumb and gullible.


Sorry I lost the context.


Toyota does not believe EVs as currently envisioned will be the future. They are reluctantly hedging their bets with limited research and some joint ventures. They think plug in hybrids should bridge the gap between now and more scalable hydrogen or EV tech that doesn’t currently exist. 

Honestly, destination charging with plug in hybrids does seem to solve a bunch of issues. The majority of people’s trips can happen on a 50-75 mile EV only mode that you charge at home, and then longer trips are still covered by your gas motor.


Toyota has split their development into Hydrogen and EV's.  

There's alot of negative talk about them but if anyone whose paid any attention to the company knows they are slow to change and are rarely if ever the first to act. They want to ensure they make quality cars, and be best in that aspect.  

There's a reason why Toyota interiors are pretty fucking crap, they use the same parts that always work and don't die over years of research and only move on when they can determine the same lifespan for the next move. 

They're developing two models to watch and be ready for the market, and then will make corrections and pivot.


I would hardly say they shat the bed on it. Hydrogen fuel cells make a lot more sense in a world with a high abundance of renewable energy, since it's a valid storage medium for that energy. It also makes a lot of sense as a replacement for gasoline in certain range boosted applications, or in situations where an EV simply isn't the best solution. There's been some speculation as to if it would make a proper replacement for Jet-A and Jet-B, but of course more testing is needed in that regard, since the current limits of physics don't allow for long haul all electric jet flights, limiting electric airlines to wide-regional commuting, like from San Francisco to LA type routes. The main issue is if that energy is better spent electrolysing water, vs heating a bio-fuel cracking facility that helps convert triglycerides into more volatile fuels, allowing us to make gasoline from algae oil in addition to diesel fuel. That said, their tech will almost certainly find applications in time, it's just going to take a lot of infrastructure investment beyond Toyota themselves, to make it viable. The main reason that EVs were able to take off as well as they did initially, was Tesla's massive investments into their supercharger network, which helped extend the practical range of their EVs tremendously, and then they provided the schematics for manufacturing those charging ports as an industry standard, allowing other EVs to use them as well, if at reduced charging rates (relative to the capabilities of your EV). But yea, if they were completely worthless, Toyota wouldn't STILL be putting research funds into them


Toyota is not genuinely interested in moving away from internal combustion engines. ICEs that the public believes will last 300k-500k miles are Toyota's #1 advantage in the marketplace. That's why Toyota tried so hard to make hydrogen a thing -- to try to placate the demands for cleaner fuel while still clinging to their ICE market-advantage. If the marketplace moves to all electric, Toyota will just become another giant battery pack on wheels with no more proven long-term reliability than any of the other entrants.


Well. Hydrogen car is an EV with extra step. The hydrogen is used to generate electricity to power the vehicles. 

But given the massive infrastructure it need to work, it will be extremely difficult to work in US. Also, the energy that requires to produce, transport and store the hydrogen is not making economic or environmental sense. The world is better off using EV or ICE car.


We do not have the capacity to fully go EV on all of our cat and road infrastructure. The power grid is not ready, we don't have the available materials, it's not happening


It also needs better battery thermals management.


As someone taller than average, I'm just glad we now have EVs bigger than the go-kart sized Leafs and Volts


To be fair Tesla made electric cars sexy and desirable. They still make good cars. Quality control is shit but the cars themselves perform well. Autopilot is a waste of money though.


The Tesla Model S was car of the year in 2013.  The performance was insane.


>The biggest nit for the Leaf is the reverse/forward shifter is opposite intuition (push forward for reverse).

Did you not drive any other car before your leaf?

I just ask because that's the norm on every car with an auto gearbox....  most cruise control column sticks are pull for more speed, push for less, paddle shifts are pull for higher gear etc etc....


I'm curious about your safety comment. Everything I read says it's one of the safest cars in the road. For example...

https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/09/07/tesla-model-y-gets-highest-safety-score-ever-in-european-test/?sh=29822ad14ff3

It still has the best charging network and charge time. I was looking hard at the Ford Mach E and the 40+ min charge time to go from 10-80% was a deal breaker for me. For as beautiful as that car is, it seems flawed with the hardware thry went with to charge.

Anyway, I'd love more of your thoughts. I'm 100% in thr market for an EV and despite Musk being a shit head, Tesla seems to still outperform.


Holmes only had to stay off MSNBC.

Con artists work through social engineering though. Rawlins left TSLA for a reason to form LCID. When he left that was the engineering brilliance disappearing that Elon's con artistry tried to claim for himself. He had to make it up the only way he knew how.


People use, but have a shoddy quality product that is missing a key feature that many of them bought it for. Theranos did make a test unit, but it was so inaccurate as to be effectively harmful, the same as a "fully self driving TSLA" causing an accident is. Just because Elon got further in the con to increase the magnitude of the harm he caused doesn't justify his actions (retroactively or not); to the contrary "in fairness to him" he should be in a multiplied amount of trouble versus Holmes relative to the more massive scale of failure his fraud represents.


Was about to say, yeah, Tesla is kind of like Theranos, if Theranos made test-kits that kind of sort of worked. Like a good 60-70% of the time. But only if you did the tests in the exact right order. And tried multiple times. And used a much larger blood sample than what was advertised. And tests for some specific diseases wouldn't work at all, despite repeated promises that they would. 

Would that still be defrauding investors? You bet your ass, just not to the same degree. I'll say this for Tesla, at the very least they have a REAL product that you CAN buy, that functions well enough in most instances, yet fails spectacularly to live up to its own hype or meet the stratospheric expectations set by their perpetual hype-man. 

A recent example that's probably even worse than Theranos or Tesla would be the Nikola electric truck company. Not only did the founder of Nikola mislead investors and tell people the company was working on technology that didn't exist, but he was also convicted of securities fraud and wire fraud. He may actually see jailtime. 

And not only did Nikola produce a pitiful number of trucks in total, some of their initial trucks were reportedly GM trucks that they simply slapped a Nikola logo on. That was their "revolutionary" prototype to get early investors excited. A complete lie.


Yes and no? Theranos was 100% fraud. Teslas are real cars but the self-driving stuff he made such enormous promises regarding that I think you could easily see a huge fraud case presented there. I mean just on the level of publically beta-testing the software on open roads. People have died. There's a certain number of car deaths to be expected but if he's approaching it with a cavalier attitude and doesn't give a shit who gets killed.... Well, it makes him no different from all the other manufacturers. So maybe nothing happens. :(


FSD is every bit as fake as her blood test machine


Yes to both. The demo was a planned demo that showed off what Tesla was working on. They promised that if you bought a car the car would one day be able to do what it did in the demo. The article is trying to make a big deal about the fact they did a demo promising a future product and the chief engineer said that there was no *production* car that could do that. Everyone knew that at the time. It was a staged demo. And guess what, my car can now do what they showed on the demo. Reddit as always is making a big deal about a total nothing burger they don't understand just because it fits their bias.


Yeah I read it

We need to also address the issue of self reporting by manufacturers


It probably doesn't brake like a human too. Humans like to 'slide forward' when stopping. Anecdote mine.


Here is a rear end cause by fsd.

https://youtu.be/91HzWPEjiCg

Not all rear ends are from other cars.


100 agree!!! 

NHSTA does a poor job of categorizing the data, but also the companies themselves do a poor job releasing the data. only a few Tesla, Waymo, etc do safety reports


> self-driving

How are you defining this?


Waymo and cruise ALWAYS have a safety driver when driving on public roads.

Whether that person who is monitoring the system is remote or in the vehicle. They are still the safety driver. It’s basically level 2. Human present for when disengagements are necessary


> Tesla has 0 miles self-driving

[Here are 11 miles of notoriously difficult road driven autonomousy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4yMGbRa4Q).


I bought a used Volt two summers ago, and it's a pretty fantastic little car. I'm able to commute to and from work on batteries, and still go on longer trips. It's too bad it was discontinued because it fills a lot of gaps


Problem is you then needs to worry about repairs for two systems in one vehicle.


A family member has a plug-in prius and it is awesome. It basically is the best of both worlds - and the electric range is just fine for 99% of their daily needs.

Increasing the range to 200+ ala a true EV just isn't necessary, and wouldn't be worth any additional cost or the inconvenience on long trips.


Isn't there a problem if gas is left to sit? If you commute 40 miles round trip daily, then once every month or two you drive out of state to visit family, your tank of gas is just going to sit there most of the time. But nobody wants a second vehicle, or to be paying for a rental several times a year.


Big if true. I think they're spot on in assuming the world still isn't ready for EVs in current form. There's been an unsettling push recently for everything to be an EV now and things like California's ludicrous 2035 deadline aren't helping. I and I think lots of other people are only just now on the hybrid bandwagon if they weren't brainwashed by Tesla marketing. But even hybrid options just aren't there imo. My next car is gonna be ICE no matter how badly I like the idea of owning a hybrid because there's just no desirable options be it for cost, availability, or personal preference. And now most companies have already abandoned the prospect of hybrids in favor going all in on EV... 

Like no wonder your electric muscle car gets made fun of, you made no effort to transition your target audience of gear heads from what they love to what they spite. On paper, a hybrid car makes literally everybody happy: better for the environment, generally better performance, better fuel economy, familiarity of an ICE, introduction to an EV.

This really makes me want to do some research and reconsider buying a Toyota or Lexus


Your description of why Toyota interiors are crap is basically my explanation for why I love my truck's interior. Bonus points for replacement parts being relatively cheap and easy to find.


They want you to pay a premium to upgrade to Lexus which has much better interiors and rates higher in terms of reliability according to consumer reports and US News.


Toyota Japan is 100% hydrogen, while internationally they’re hedging their bets with EV. The implications of going 100% EV is all their investments for Hydrogen go out the door, and the family businesses closely associated with Toyota to build ICE of hydrogen parts are put out of work.


Not offended, but I think you should know that the interior in my Toyota SAI is far from crap. It's a very nice place to be.


So much this. I went from a '96 base model Corolla to a 2010 Prius, and the interior just wasn't that much better. Refinement at best, but the industry was transforming during that same time period. I wasn't expecting a luxury car, but they could have done much better at the price point. Later models of the same car were more of the same too.


Toyota does not make crap interiors. Look at literally any Lexus. High quality leather that keeps well, beautiful design, and gadgets that still work even decades later.


I'm working on wrapping up my degree in an industrial field and Toyota is the beginning and end when it comes to Industry 4.0. they waste nothing and deliver quality to their internal and external customers (they believe employees are internal customers and are just as important.)


> There's a reason why Toyota interiors are pretty fucking crap

Ok.

> they use the same parts that always work and don't die over years of research and only move on when they can determine the same lifespan for the next move.

Oh, you forgot /s in the first statement


> to try to placate the demands for cleaner fuel while still clinging to their ICE market-advantage

do their hydrogen models have ice engines?


So true. I can't stand go-kart sized Japanese cars, I'm just not small enough to comfortably fit in them


Minivans FTW


How can you say at the same time, they make good cars. But the quality control is shit? 

Are the cars shit or not? Because it doesn’t matter how fast it can get to 60 if it’s a piece of shit


That was the first car of this style shifter that I had driven.  My prior several vehicles had manual transmissions so I have to go back 20 ish years to an automatic.  It was so different that to me it wasn't intuitive.  Picture here: [link 2013 Leaf](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/nissan/leaf/2013/photos-interior/gear-shift)


Holmes never had a working product ever, the tech is still many years away.


Well we're talking about different things I think.  But I don't disagree either way.

1.  Did he commit fraud by overstating capabilities to customers and investors?  Maybe.  Certainly seems like he lied about capabilities or about things coming very soon and this lead to investors and customers investing/buying when they otherwise would not have.  They would need to put together the case which would include the timeline of what he said _and_ proof of what he knew (which can be tough) and when he knew it.  Holmes was convicted for similarly lying to investors about the product.

2.  Does TSLA/Elon calling something "full self driving" or whatever make them responsible for property damage and/or injury/death when users treat it like "full self driving" despite the big (I assume, I haven't read the manual) disclaimer that says all sorts of shit about how it really isn't full self driving?  Again, I think "hell yes they are" because I work in a parallel sort of industry and I get reprimanded internally if I even get close to implying something as unsupportable/hyperbolic as that.  Again, that's just under INTERNAL scrutiny.  Not regulatory or customer scrutiny.  Holmes wasn't convicted of lying to end customers (patients) leading to harm to them mostly because she didn't talk directly to the end customers.  Elon does.  A fuck ton.  So he can get fucked.

Reddit has a pretty big anti-Musk (and by extension "anti-Tesla") hard on. Specially this sub. It's funny how some years ago, when most news articles were positive, "Tesla" as a topic was banned from this sub. But now that most articles are critical? You see tons of articles completely void of real content, talking about how Musk didn't properly comb his hair 15 years ago, on a daily basis.

Big subs here on reddit are absolute propaganda machines. And most news pamphlets are ad churning schemes where "articles" are written by people who have zero idea what they're talking about, but are experts in getting that "rage clicking" reaction from potential readers. They aren't news companies, they're ad revenue reaping companies. Guys, you are being fed propaganda, lies, exaggerations, and hear say. And I say this as someone who dislikes Musk and who would never buy a Tesla.

And how tesla deactivates autopilot/FSD moments before a crash for this exact reason.


99% of humans are dogshit at understanding how brakes/braking works. Ever notice someone tapping their brakes literally every 5 seconds? That's because they're too dumb to understand how cars work, it will slow down by itself, just use the gas to keep the speed. 

/end rant


Technically by many laws and insurance it doesn’t matter what the person in front does if the person behind hit them, it’s the person behind’s fault


I said so in the comment. Tesla has 0 miles reported as self-driving, which any self-driving companies have to do. The guy I'm responding to posted the source themselves:

https://thelastdriverlicenseholder.com/2022/02/09/2021-disengagement-report-from-california/


It's easy; who has the liability in the event of a crash, the manufacturer or the driver?


This is completely incorrect. Waymo has actual vehicles picking people up without drivers. You can go to /r/SelfDrivingCars and see many examples. Here are a couple examples:

https://mobile.twitter.com/thecatwineguy/status/1606170908959260673

https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/10026t8/waymo_merges_onto_a_big_busy_street_in_san/

And no, you're not allowed to simply drive the vehicle remotely if there are issues because of many issues including latency. They have people monintoring remotely and if there are issues they drive to the location and fix it manually.


This has a safety driver and does not count as self-driving. Tesla itself does not report it which they would have to do if it were self driving:

https://thelastdriverlicenseholder.com/2022/02/09/2021-disengagement-report-from-california/

Here is Waymo doing a similarly dangerous track in Lombard Street in **2009**. These sorts of roads are not difficult for even L2 systems to do. They are not representative of self-driving obstacles. CGP Grey is letting his excitement cloud his judgment, and I really enjoy his content.

https://youtu.be/4V2bcbJZuPQ


Modern cars are pretty dang reliable though. Toyota doubly so. Cost of owership over 100k will be more, but after 200k when an EVs batteries would need replaced, the plug in hybrid keep chugging.


PHEVs have been demonstrated to be the most reliable and have the lowest maintenance cost of all vehicle types.


My 10 year old Chevy Volt needs an oil change every other year, spark plugs once a decade, and that's about it.


Plus the extra weight, higher servicing costs, much higher running costs, lower resale value, much higher taxes in some places etc etc


Different brands deal with this differently. Gas is typically good 3-6 months. The old volt would sense stale gas and run the ice motor instead of the electric to use it up. Looks like the Toyotas tell you to add fresh gas every so often, and that you’ll use enough on regular trips when accelerating hard or merging on the freeway. Others say use premium gas with no ethanol if you can, as it gums up less.


Apocryphal, but there's a story that was on here from an auto engineer at a trade show, back when full-colour LCD screens (ugh) were just becoming a thing.

A BMW rep was showcasing his car's yuuuuuge colour LCD, when everyone knew Toyota was still on dot matrix green ones. 

BMW said to a passing Toyota rep "When are you guys gonna get something like this, eh?"

And the Toyota rep just shot back "When we're sure it actually works."


I had an Isuzu flat bed truck in the 90's and noticed the interior door handles were the same as my old 1974 Holden Gemini (rebadged from Isuzu).

There was a 22 year timespan between them at the time.


This thread is wack.  Toyota doubled down on hybrid cars.   

They are thinking smartly, hybrid is the way to go at the moment.  If you live where the temp goes below freezing, an EV is going to get you stranded.


You make a valid point, but I also get what previous comment was saying.

It’s like BMW…people always talk about them as being high-quality, yet everyone I’ve known who has owned one complains about how much time it’s spent in the shop and many have said they’ll never own one out of warranty.

Doesn’t sound like quality to me, but what do I know? I just drive my Toyotas for years on nothing but standard maintenance.


Yeah, a standard automatic transmission shifter is, in descending order, P R N D, so that picture you linked to follows same design, but with park off to the side…seems naturally intuitive to me, and probably to most


I mean manuals come in all different types. My car I have push down on the stick then back to get it into reverse. 

This seems like a pretty minuscule complaint considering it’s the norm lol.


Lots of manual transmissions force you to push the stick forward to get in reverse...


well props for driving manuals but you're part of a tiiiiny minority there

edit: autos have the PRND pattern for a reason


I would not find this intuitive either


She had testers in Walgreens (CVS?) that had high false positive and negative rates. There were discussions about putting her on trial for manslaughter when one of the people got a false negative for a cancer diagnosis and ended up dying later. Go read Bad Blood again.


But if it can't drive you fully by itself, it's not full self driving yeah? What exists now is advanced driver assist, not FSD.


FSD doesn't work either, or else it:

1) wouldn't be "beta"

2) would be offered as robotaxi's that he promised

3) would transfer the crash liability to tesla

4) would be reported to regulators as an actual level 3+ system


Sorry to break up the psychology lecture, but if you guys think that the tech in the video has been delivered then you’re living in your own universe.  They also didn’t say anywhere that it was aspirational, you guys are inferring that all on your own.  

The car can’t go park itself like in the video, the commenter above acknowledges this, and then ignores it like it’s not relevant.  Maybe you guys need more psychology classes idk


> Again, Tesla does not appear this year, and the reason lies in the definition of what is considered an autonomous test vehicle. Tesla’s current interpretation of the FSD Beta, which is now in use in about 60,000 customer vehicles, is that it is a driver assistance system that does not require reporting to the DMV. California is currently working to close this interpretation gap.

Isnt that more a matter of definition though? Tesla doesnt own and operate the vehicle, and for reasons Im sure we can all speculate over they still call it a "driver assistance" feature... but even on Autopilot the car is absolutely driving itself.


So that is what defines a self driving vehicle?


The difference is between driving a mapped street (as Waymo do, and as the old Tesla video did) vs. SLAM (Simultaneous Location and Mapping) on an unmapped road.


I guess the battery helps prolong the life of the ICE, otherwise you'd be looking at a similar replacement time for each. Modern EV batteries look to last about as long as modern engines - probably 300k miles, maybe more. The key difference with modern ones is they're all cooled properly - the first gen leafs weren't, which is what caused all those failures.


100k km new timing belt needed seals, water pump etc., for the next 100k

Towed quite a few , most Toyota owners know more about their washing machine and don't want to know what is under the bonnet/hood .

Toyota aren't stupid, it's a non interference motor so the service is a pretty straight forward job and it's back on the road for the next tow-in 5 years later.


My Mach E shows a maintenance schedule of checking the brakes at 100k then checking battery coolant at 200k. That's it.  I'd be interested to see what data you're citing that shows a dual system car is lower maintenance than a simple electric motor.


Yup those LED/LCD screens are shit.


My Tacoma has [this LED compass and temp display.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/272044035237?chn=ps&norover=1&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&mkcid=2&mkscid=101&itemid=272044035237&targetid=1645685073288&device=m&mktype=&googleloc=9010646&poi=&campaignid=16730423415&mkgroupid=135815925780&rlsatarget=pla-1645685073288&abcId=9300841&merchantid=8300524&gbraid=0AAAAAD_QDh9AIJVn8eNeeY0HLw5IdKMeb&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8aOeBhCWARIsANRFrQGvRIf2KsO4X0Hqa0GPO9KkyDHMFSK78Q8f5-JX5vMa4K9Ml5f93t0aApmdEALw_wcB)

It has a design flaw: There are two small surface mounted resistors that are prone to having their solder joints break after many heat/cool cycles. As you can see in the link above, it’s about $150 to replace the whole unit. 

When mine failed I was able to repair it with a [better design I found online](https://www.mdpub.com/compass/index.html) using about $1 worth of replacement resistors. Not a huge deal if you know how to solder, but annoying.


Majority of people here view the USA car market as being the same as the rest of the world. This thread is whack asf people don't know wtf they are talking about


Temps are not Toyota’s reasoning. They doubled down on hydrogen because they sunk so much r&d money into it when no one else would AND when there was no Tesla or anyone in the EV space.


My translation of that is “the car is high performance and mechanically reliable, drivetrain-wise, but a lot of little ancillary things like door latches and subsystems are flaky/lack QA.”  So in other words, like a BMW.


What are you, German? ;)


Only in the US. 

But irrespective, I drive a leaf too and have had lots of prior cars, both manual and auto, and found the leaf “stick” to be entirely intuitive. I’m not sure what they’re on about.


Those machines never worked, they used third party labs for the vast majority of results.

Even with the absolutely no driver assistance, every car is driving itself, depending on the definition.  I don’t physically turn the tires, or push fuel into the engine, or move the cylinders, or even move the windshield wipers.  Even with my hands on the wheel, and my foot on the pedal, the car is completely driving itself.  Again, depending on the definition.

Curious that cars with cinder blocks tied to the gas pedal aren’t included in self-driving.  Curious that the motorcycle I ghost rode last week wasn’t listed.  Curious that the AI programmed drone I built isn’t listed.

Yeah, of course definition matters.  And to me, a lane assistance, ABS, and cruise control are not self driving.  To me.  Definitionally.


It separates who's serious and who's full of shit


What the heck lmao. That's insane that the pogo still worked too. I'd be excited just to get that demo.


Rocking the Bronze Tournament Winner title too. Nasty.


An incoming quick chat before the demo is about the only thing that would make this perfect


A literal missile strike


goomba'd.


That was a thing of beauty. I love getting Fatality goals.


This should be a forbidden technique


Well, I've watched this a number of times on repeat now. Makes me want to play, not that i could achieve, but some clips are inspirational


that was too cool


i mean thats a nice shot but sometimes i jump when i mean to 👍


God damn that was crazy


So dope!


First time I see that fam, congrats!!!
Now I wonder doing one with someone on the ceiling!!! New demo meta!!


Daaaaaaaaaaamn


Sick goal!


Fucking sexy


![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)


Bro these people have families


That was actually kinda nasty. I like it can yu do that consistently???


That goal animation is very phallic and suggestive


Savage!


What a save!
What a save! 
What a save! 

Love hoops clips! That was nice!


Insult? ✔️

Injury? ✔️


Now THAT is podracing


Bro literally stomped on him


u/savevideo


Pinched the opponent into a demo lmao


DAMN


Goomba stomp

I would uninstall


Wow. Toxic move…but well done


This is the most insane thing I watched about Basketball mode


Sheeeshhh


One of the most insane clips I’ve seen here. I’m kinda new to the sub but daaaaaaamn son that’s nasty


I would just uninstall rocket league, epic and windows if i got pogo demoed + scored on


The disrespect is 🔥🔥🔥


![gif](giphy|npCDi7hWyL52zReYSG)


I shall name this one "the Javelin".


Love that your teammate was rushing in for the double commit on that LOL, simply amazing play though.


That's filthy man, great job!!


Calculated


I call that a cruise missile


You need to submit this for my calculated series.


Odd that you kept your momentum through the demo on this one.


Oooo that made my insides warm


That was nasty. That car had a family


The demo was incidental, it was just supposed to be a pogo lol


It’s bumpo! Love you mane!


Haha thanks!


Lol if only I'd have known beforehand!


Trueee


Target acquired.


The 8th goomba, I got a 1up for it lol


Thanks me too!

This comment made me think of this for some reason lol


Oh crap maybe it is and I need to watch my back now


Haha I totally get that. This was all luck tho so you might have even better luck sometime!


Thanks man, I just wish I could do it on purpose!


Thanks G!


Haha I hope not, I already have a hard time seeing people coming!


Appreciated!


No u r

Thanks haha I wish, it was just supposed to be a pogo

Nooooo!


Didn't know you liked demos 😏 lol how do you want it submitted? PS love your videos!


I believe that has to do with whether you're boosting or not at the point of impact but I've been wrong before


That kind of makes it even better! Exciting!

Now you have to get a 5 kill streak to do that again 😂


Well yu made it look so purposeful maybe yu should try to incorporate demo pogos into your pogo game plays


I have specific channels in my discord, other wise just dm me on reddit.


No its a compliment


A bronze back in s2 being a c1 now I don’t get how that can be a low chance


It was done as ethically as possible, never threw a game without a full and consenting party and won 1 tourney. I get where you're coming from though and not arguing.


This sounds like a leth video


Discord joined & clip submitted thanks man!


I have a Bronze S3 tournament winner title. I was legitimately bronze in S3. I peaked at C1 Div IV last season.

S2 was a while ago, OP being C1 now is believable.

Edit: they admitted to throwing to get it (with consenting teammates). But it is possible to have this legitimately.


And after that you can never play tourneys again? because otherwise you will smurf in the next 10(?) tournaments as well until you are back at your normal tourney rang


Sounds like a massive waste of time to me


The goals have blockers until one team gets a certain amount of demos without one of them dying. So they chase each other for demos and once a goal opens it’s a max scramble for one team to score while avoiding demos and hoping the opponent’s don’t open their own net lol


Nah it was when tourney rank reset and we got 2s and extra tourneys and stuff so it went right back to normal


Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, ours just don't align this time


I like it, I'd play. I was just picturing RL with COD-like killstreaks, or even just rumble power ups


You’re “opinion” still involves taking away real bronze player’s chance to win their first tourney so no, you’re not entitled to that at all


Hahaha yes, they are entitled to that opinion. You’re just plain entitled.


When I started playing I was into silver tourneys before I could even play a tourney. The bronze player base is one of the smallest in the game. Clearly he did it as ethically as possible so it’s not a big deal. Focus on the cool play that was the point of the post:)


> The bronze player base is one of the smallest in the game.

There’s around 17,000 players in bronze tournament level. There’s around 1,200 players in SSL tournament level. 17x the amount of bronze than there are SSL.

People who are legitimately in bronze tournaments are either brand new, have disabilities or ailments that prevent them from ranking up, or the third category of players like OP who throw their rank to get a cringe player title.

So you’re either scaring off brand new players by smurfing on them, or dunking on people with disabilities… Pathetic either way and the fact that y’all defend that shit is beyond me. All so you can have an edgy player title


❤️


Bro watched too many sunlesskhan videos…


(*helicopter taking off sounds*)

*Legend says he never returned...*


I wait for him to be spinning it behind himself, then stab him with a spear and take all of his gold


I need a version where the staff is edited out


[deleted]


Damn, it's so fast that the bar looks like it's bending from the speed


I would smack my face with it


Imagine what he can do with his dick!


It's like going from 1x to 16x in a jiffy!


I always thought they were spinning the staff over the backs of their knuckles like spinning a pen. I expect too much from the world...


Anyone else save this post to eventually learn how to do this when we never get to it? 

I did.


Damn! I wish I had seen this video when I was 10 playing with brooms as spears out of boredom during my holidays!


I thought he was going to take off


I'm saving this post so that I can never learn it later.


All the gangs keep wanting him to join cuz he’s pretty good with a bow staff


Me, grabbing my 6-foot colour guard flag from the garage: welp, it’s been a month since I’ve spun you (or tossed you for that matter)

I went out last night to practice and didn’t catch a single toss :(

That thing becomes a swimming pool noodle


He doesn’t stop. He just spins faster and faster and faster. All he knows is spinning. No one can stop him. He will start flying soon. The only thing you can do is run.


All I do is spin


I'm sorry but I wasn't looking at the correct staff.


He’s on the roof because his mother finally had enough of his shenanigans


The rotation move he does to take the staff from his back to the front is really fucking with my mind and I don't know why.


I reckon he must have hit himself in the face hard at one point.


This guy's about to start lifting off!


Wonder if he could beat two soon to be blade masters at the same time, I'd wager gold on on it.


So that's how my Tenno deflects bullets. Neat.


When the camera man backed up, I knew shit was gonna get real.


I definitely executed this maneuver in high school with a flag at halftime shows. I think it was a called a cradle. He makes it look way cooler with a staff.


May the ~~force~~ 4th be with him


And then Harrison Ford shoots him


Metal Bender!


From spinning to a disco move


Keep it slow dude, he is gonna fly


Looks like helicopter wings I thought he was about to fly away


At that speed, with two staffs he will fly to the space


I could do that, it looks easy... oh wait


Helicopter man


"If you can do it slowly, you can do it fast"


Well.. That escalated quickly..


Is it wrong that this is SUCH a turn on?

I am literally thirsty for this man, with his skills.


PSA: Don’t fuck with this guy.


Cameraman wisely backs up...


So wait you never roll it through your fingers??


Rest of the fucking owl


This MF gonna take off if he carries on spinning it that fast.

That was awesome


i can see him fly away like a helicopter


Yep, that’s how I do it too. You know, all the spinning stuff and wutnot


Who else could hear the sound in their heads?


just wait till he learns the golden spin


I just want to try this myself!

Do you guys remember how were these folded staffs called?


Can he do the Super Spin.?


Nice to see the camera can't catch up to his speed.

Brosef 💪


I knew that old mop I keep at the attic will be useful one day


These marketing ads from Nike are getting intense


He goes kind of fast towards the end


I'd definitely break my face in the second try


Bruh any faster he might just fly away like a helicopter


I thought he was going to fly away.


I never realized until now how badly I need a staff.


Tried


My wrist hurts looking at it


Me saving this even though I will never do this


#bonk


I got carpul tunnel just watching that


As dope as that is... gotta be horrible for the wrists. 

And jaw...


It's the Obi-Ani Spin!!!


This man outrolled the rolling shutter


Yeah you better keep that arm against your body


I learned this on my high school flag squad


One mistake and this dude will knock himself unconscious


Replace it with a lightsaber and now you have the prequels.


2) Draw the rest of the fucking owl


All fun and games until you shit whip yourself in the face


Is the fucking bar bending from the force? That’s.. metal.. as fuck.


His body says fight me, but his face says kiss me.


That looks so weird without the blur of the staff moving, like it's not real...


Anyone else thought he was going to used a paint roller and that’s why his shirt has specks all over it


Just like what i do with my pp after peeing


Great wrist movement.


It's all about planes, and your hand as the pivot point between. The staff is always going the same direction, you're just moving it from in front to behind. 
 
It's actually really easy to learn once the physics makes sense and you try. Everybody, go grab a stick!


Holy crap thats fast


I would take a class on this


Mole


*breaks my own nose*


I will be saving this


I like the hand on the belly to shift his weights toward the center


Its really wild how he maintains his centre mass just by holding his stomach and counterbalancing the staff to himself. Some really amazing talant once perfected. Especially if something like this is viable in a practical sense.


Saving this so I remember how to fuck up and injure myself later


Me pretending to be a jedi as a kid be like


Or just shoot him


He was just about to match the frame rate of the camera.


Staff spinning is always fun to do


"i'll try spinning, that's a good trick"


I’m glad to know that holding your stomach with your free hand when ringing shit around yourself is universal


I was waiting for him to fly. 🤔


Donatello does machines.


Oh ok now I know what to do. /s


This looks a whole lot like color guard and twirling a flag!


Can someone do a mashup of this and the flag twirlers from that episode of SpongeBob at the bubble bowl?


I’m not sure if this is a metal pole or a pool noodle the way it looks like it bends in the video


Thought the fucker was gonna take off then


Yup, I’m the cool kid now


I can do stuff like this, it really isn't as hard as it looks. I'd say you can learn the basics in a week. It takes a while to be able to do it really smoothly though.


Try that with a light sabre please!


“Imagine if I had a real weapon”


Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck


I would hit the back of my head, no doubt.


He spun the staff faster than the shutter speed......


HOLY FUCK


Christ it looked like it was bending


I was sure he was going to take off like a helicopter...


Thanks, now I am also a kung fu master


I remember colorguard.

Seriously, though. I'm practicing this twirly move, right now.


reminds me of the dumb pencil wiggle everyone did as kids. this is definitely better tho


Well done!


Not even impressed, I can do that but with 2 staves.


CAUTION! side effect: Stomachache


Anyone else is saving this?


This needs swish swish sounds


This man out here turning color guard into color warrior


I'm gonna need multiple dental and rhinoplasty surgeries now.


PS CHALLENGE SHOP OUT THE STAFF


Saving this until the next time I find a cool stick in my backyard


I picture this is how electrons work.


HAHAHAHHAH

Chill out, Kilik.


This is baton practice.


Real talk though, where can I find that Nike space shirt?


Impressive af. Now to master it myself since quarantine is still a thing.


Can someone Photoshop him taking off like a helicopter?


It's super easy to get started on this trick. Draw figure 8 on it's side with one end of the staff and slowly speed up.


I was waiting for him to kick it into high gear, didn’t disappoint


Would this help to defend one self ?


DENTISTS LOVE HIM!


Bro chill. I'm still at finger finger spin. Finger. Fuckin I cant keep up


For about 70% of it I was thinking to myself "this is really not that impressive" then the realization hit me and I started to go from "oh, OH, OHHH!!!!"


I am the the Force and the force is with me.


It's a bendy straw. Nailed it.


When you make metal look like it’s bent

I used to do this shit in my garden (yes, the front garden where everyone could see) as a young 15 year old neckbeard, I'm pretty good at it to the point where I can throw  it up in the air and catch it, except one day I didn't catch it and it slammed down on the tips of my fingers and busted my fingernail open.

Learned a painful lesson that day....but at least I looked kinda cool?


Ok.  What happened after impacts?

Because impact happens.


Wow dude. Just fucking wow


imagine losing grip..


I have 2 cardboard tubes pretty much this exact size and I'm going to go full Star Wars kid trying to do this.


Instant internal bleeding when he catches it with his armpit.

I wonder how many times that bar caught him in the face during his practice phase


That's awesome! I'm going to try. Smacks shin.


WTF!


Dope.


Wow, he spinned it so fast he bended the pole

Was just mouthing "ladies and gentlemen start your engined" as he got faster.

Also Aussieman voice as he reached top speed


Can someone please edit this video to make him fly away like a helicopter???
Thanks in advance!

I didn't know you could do that trick backwards.


he gonna take off


And there goes my light fixture. great.

Do this instead of poi


It didn't even maintain its molecular composition it was spinning so fast


Perfect fit for the stereotype


Imagine him flying like a heli


roses are red,
violets are blue,
there will always be an asian,
who is better than you


Holy fuck I would stay 10 m from him


Every time I try spinning a staff, I usually hit myself in the face, and sure that hurts, but imagine if he hit himself in the face spinning it at that speed


Could someone theoretically calculate the speed of rotation by measuring how bent the staff looks in a given frame?

Staff spinner here.  It is inevitable.  The only way to learn not to smack yourself in the face is to smack yourself in the face.

As someone who has been spinning staffs for a long time, it happens. Luckily it’s been years since last time since that shit hurt af.

At first I thought this was some horrendous way of saying "gif" and was ready to throw it down but then I realised it was just a saying.

All is good in the world again.


There are different methods where you do spin it over your knuckles.


I thought so too, but this makes sense, cause he still has a good grip on it at all times.


I'll add this to the 50 other things I've saved on Reddit  that I eventually would like to learn.


It's basically the same concepts used in poi, just applied to a poll. You can learn this in a few minutes.


It's really easy. Grab a pole which is as long as the floor up to your armpit in length, and balance the pole in one band where the part between your thumb and index finger is. That's the sweet spot and length to do this most effectively. I had a jo staff in martial arts and learned this in one rotation, it's easier than it looks.

Of course, using a pole as long as his, a bo staff length (jo staff is around 4 feet, a bo staff is around 6 feet) makes these motions slightly harder, but only in strength needed to apply the motion.


It’ll take you about an hour to learn this staff spinning pattern. As a circus/performance thing this is one of the most basic patterns that you learn in your very first beginner class. As a martial arts thing you won’t ever use it.


Bo staff, not bow.


I knew I could find another fellow colorguard-er! It’s been years for me, but I still have a flag, maybe I’ll give a try too! :)


I was looking for the colorguard comment. Wish I still had a flag! I graduated a few years ago and haven't spun in over a year, I need to dust off my rifle and practice some doubles.


I’m almost certain I did this exact spin back in high school. Just not as fast cause, you know, the silk and weights. 

Still have my rifle, not that I ever actually toss it.


Here for the colorguarders!


Yass colorguard! Been a bit longer for me but I’m glad I’m not the only one who looked at this and was like “oh, I totally got that”.


Excited to find another guardie!! I teach it and I miss my kids so much


I totally stole my high school practice flag for moments like these. My mom gave it away after I moved out :(


Yep, did this in colorguard as well. I think we called it a toaster though because you were supposed to act like you were in a toaster and keep it parallel to your body so you didn't get zapped by the toaster walls.

Son of a bitch, ya got me


Wouldn't it still "look like" that if it wasn't the camera shutter?


While true, that is a different effect than the one at play here.


You have more than one?


it is very thin and hollow, which is how he gets this speed on his flowers without tearing a wrist ligament. proper flowers are much slower and done with two hands because the solid wood staves are much heavier. your head would leave this thing dented and bent.

Smart copy paste comment


Nah, it would just be blurry.

The camera gives it that effect because it records a part of the image linearly, and since it's so fast when it captures the other parts they are in a different place which gives it the "bent" look.

Eyes don't do this.


I think it would be blurry irl no? Dunno if you'd actually see it bend like that. But I could be wrong

Sick name btw


You mean my eyes aren't cameras that scan from top left to bottom right? Weird


I don’t think you know how physics works. That staff is what, 1.25” in diameter? Yes, it is rather hollow. However, at the speed you can swing the staff hitting bone with an initial impact of a couple millimeters where the staff connects with bone it will cause, at bare-fucking-minimum, immense pain, up to a broken bone

In the game I ran earlier today, my players are exploring an ancient lost city and met a girl who seems to be its caretaker.

The rogue, taking watch at night: Rolls a nat 1 on perception, has +5 and darkvision, so still gets a 6.

Me: Excellent, she'll be able to sneak up on them and observe them at close, so it'll be a big surprise when they wake up and see her. Let me just roll her stealth check...

Me: Rolls a 1. 

So instead, the rogue heard her trip and fall. In her haste to try to get away, she rolled *another* 1 on stealth, and so tripped and fell again.

I was intending for her to be this mysterious, enigmatic figure, but the dice turned her into the Cute Clumsy Girl anime archetype. Dammit, D&D.

Aha bless mate ty


Yeah it'd just be blurry,  like when doing helicopter dick


I also have a black belt, and am a structrual engineer -- it will hurt but you won't break a bone on this unless you were an idiot and tried to block it with your arm or it hit your collarbone. these things weigh nothing, around a pound, and diameter doesn't matter for shit. you would be hard pressed to break a bone with a proper staff and XMA shit is a joke.

don't bring up physics when you yourself know that all your fleshy bits will handle the impact just fine. bones are much stronger than you think they are and the impact is spread over a much larger area.


Agreed. Getting hit by waxwood also sucks a lot, but at least it has some give to it. It'll really hurt either way.

That's what you get for not utilising automatic fails on Nat 1s. Regardless of your poor rolls, the Rogue still would've perceived very little, if anything at all. You could even argue you didn't need to roll after the Rogue had their guaranteed fail.


I'd be down to do it.

It is few tutorials away, do it yourself


Lol classic


It's not specifically about FPS, it's about the way the camera captures a frame. The shutter speed will affect the bend of the pole and FPS (although probably not practically) theoretically constrains the shutter speed.


What about floppy ruler?


This is somewhere between “Yeah this guy knows what he’s talking about” and the “Navy Seal Copypasta”.


A hockey stick weighs between 1-2lbs and you can definitely murder the shit out of a bone with one of those. Those extendable batons are between .5-1lb same thing there. Even medieval weapons meant for one handed use tend to weigh between 1-2lbs because it's basically impossible to swing anything heavier fast enough to be worth using anyway and I'm pretty sure those have broken a bone or two in their day.

Do you have more, this is great


And also what you get for not doing a little fudge here and there to enhance the experience. Unless you’re directly rolling in front of them, then it’s easy enough to do even with a bad poker face. 

Roll the dice but decide it’s says 15 before it lands. Wait for the roll to stop moving and ‘glance’ at it, tell yourself it’s 15 and ‘ok that’s a success’. Move on.

As a player I don’t like the idea of my DM fudging... however if they do it and I don’t know and the story is cooler for it then I... well don’t know so it’s cool. As a DM I refuse to fudge attack rolls, but may change the damage or ability/save throws that will allow the enhancement of the story, or straight up give the fun factor to the player for tension.

But ability checks aren't supposed to have critical failures or successes? And Rogues have Reliable Talent too which directly deals with this


"I'd" the universal word for "but I won't"


thats really good


Wow!  That looks really good!!  Give yourself some credit!


Wow nicely done mate


genuinely didn’t expect that


Nice bit of editing, that.


u/walnutscorpion owes you platinum


Damn bro, nice job!


Oh yeah, I get it. Thanks for explaining it so nicely though.

My comment came from when PC gaming started to be able to play at 60fps when consoles were locked to smaller amounts."The human eye can only see 30 FPS was the console argument of why it didn't matter.


a hockey stick is also made of solid wood meant to take impacts, as are the police batons which are much thicker internally as they're not even 1/3 the length and weigh 2-3x more. 

for the record a proper sword is 2-4 lbs. weight is not a good predictor of damage. a hollow aluminum tube less than a mm thick is not going to critically wound anyone.


Roll a Con save vs STIs


I’ll be your Huckleberry...

Rolls by the DM should mostly be done if you're okay with the consequence of a low roll. If you specifically want to make the character sneaky and mysterious, I would personally avoid the roll and just have her turn up there. If the Rogue is a great RP'er and high rolled, definitely have the Rogue notice, but the roll in this situation hurt the story, meaning it wasn't a great time to roll.  

That said, I've never DM'ed, but it's something that interests me wildly, so take my comment with a grain of salt.


Same, man. My games been on hold because of COVID and its heart breaking.


I hate both of you.


Yeah, totally get you, it's always been such a silly argument, it's so easy to see a difference between 30 FPS and above. Even beyond that you can see a clear difference!


> If the Rogue is a great RP'er and high rolled, definitely have the Rogue notice, but the roll in this situation hurt the story, meaning it wasn't a great time to roll.

Honestly, I wouldn't say it did. It just made them take a different impression of this NPC. They think she's adorable now, not enigmatic. That's something I can work with. 

The rogue is also an incorrigible flirt, RP-wise, so it made for some comedy when the rest of the party woke up and was like "Dammit, Ander, were you going to scare her off?"


You should try playing online with tools like roll20 and a discord.


I saw this comment and knew exactly what was going on but I still clicked it why am I the way I am


that was insane


absolutely sexy move


gotta be the cleanest turnaround I've seen! wp and gj


siick !  what is your camer setting looks cool


This is probably the best clip I've seen. Much cooler than any freestyle trick out there imo.


Hello? Police? Yes I'd like to report a murder!


Can you calm down good lord


Damn I even felt a slight breeze as he totally whiffed the ball + you! 💨💨💨💨 Sick moves!


When you jumped to avoid the demo, turned in the air, and then flicked your hood forward towards the ball, how did you do that little flick? Was it a cancelled front flip?


I was just about to go play and then I saw this.  Now I feel a little less competitive.


It’s Reddit clips like this that get me reinstalling this game


You’ve got to be cheating lol


I don't think I have this button on my controller


SHEEEEEESH


Excuse me, what the fuck did you just do there?!


Pretty nice but the open-net goal is the most impressive part


Jesus Christ I just sat up


Anyone wanting to know how to forget to hold power slide and just stop dead sideways…hit me up I can provide free coaching…


Anti demo maneuver, meh. That flip reposition to go towards goal, insane!


That fact that you stayed airborne after the turn around is nutty. You could have easily just landed and walked it in but you styled on him hard.


Now that is rocket league jazz


Unbelievably smooth


Yeah I ain’t playin the same game as y’all


Ball chasing never prospers


Did you just score against your own team?


Why is orange on the right if u are orange team
Sick moves btw wish I could do that


Anti ankles maneuver


These camera settings are speedy


Aka the porti flick


Filthy


Curious here, why take the ball across your own goal? Doesn’t it leave it vulnerable? I’ve been told to push the ball outside rather than across when dribbling towards your own goal.


I mean isn't that your opponent? Just based on the score, it should say 3-0 and not the opposite


Is this legal?


1v1 player 🤮


Noice


what a move man, may u ask what your camera settings are?


Smoov


niiiice


Howwwww???????? Disbelief!!!


saucyyyyyy


Yo


Sheesh!!!!!!!


**QWHAT**


daaamn dude


Buttery. So fucking buttery


Amazing


that's pretty sick


Smooth


Sheeeeeesh, that was smooth asf!


Wow that was really clean


That’s some dirty control. I’m nursing a wet tip here.


Damn that was slick


Holy shit man great play


🧈🧈🧈


How do you do that flip to end up straight (apart from moving your sick a bit)?


Beautiful


sex


How do y'all achieve these moves? Is a scuff controller necessary?


That was the single sexiest thing I’ve seen in my life


How did you tap it forward towards the goal without doing a full flip?


Ankle broken


Has to be one of the cleanest clips I've ever seen


Yea I reported you also


Nice shot!
Nice shot!
What a save!


Jesus that was such a clean reversal


How did your opponent react to this? Super salty? Or "can't even get mad"?


super smooth, it's super satisfying to watch


omfg


Savage AF


Beautiful 🥰


Hell yeah dude! Can you cancel the front flip with an air roll or did you cancel it by pulling back on your analog? Been trying to get my mechanics cleaner like that.


Sheesh that was sweaty


fucking smoked the shit outta that dude.


just ended that mans career


Whew that was smooth!


I'm not even impressed by the anti-demo part, just the maneuver AFTER. Wtf? And you caught some serious speed so quickly


As a demo delivery man I can appreciate a good dodge. 11/10.


Is it possible to learn this power?


My first reaction was “this was poetry”


Ngl, I haven't played this game in 3 yrs, I watch subreddit clips, but this has to be one of the nastiest things I've ever seen. Good shit sir.


That was ghost pepper chili levels of spicy my dude, holy cow!


Aaalmost lost control there at the end. Nice turnover!


This goal was so clean that it singlehandedly cured 10,000 Covid cases


That was clean af


Excuse tf me


Excuse me what the fuck?!?!


Y'all playing a different game than I am.

*Rocket League*, right?


I think I just ranked up to grand champion just by watching this


Is this a new map?


That’s some ball control right there


With my luck there’d be a lag spike as I jumped and it would turn into an own goal.


That was so smooth


That's what you get for demoeing


Holy shit


SIKE


That was beautiful. Your an artist.


jesus, clean


Initiate defensive maneuvers!


I don’t think I’ve seen anything more unethical. That poor bastard’s axles…


The disrespect with that turn around 😷😷😷


u/savevideo


Smooth af 🙌🏼


FILTH


What's your air roll sensitivity at??


Close One!


I'm  uninstalling the game for him


insanely elegant


That was cleaner than my asshole


That’s the dopest thing I’ve seen on this game


How the fuck..? This has to be the fastest turnaround ive seen


Fuckin nasty


Sensitivity settings?


How in the fuck. I’m a trash can diamond 2 player and this just blew my mind I wish I was 1/4 as good as you that was so sick


Nice bump!

Nice bump!

Nice bump!


you must he pounding ALL the girls


Super unique play


This transcends reality, it's so smooth.


Absolutely one of the best posts I have seen on this sub. Wow.


What the actual fuck


You sneaky sexy bitch


dude. you’ve got absolute mastery of the control of your car. I’ve never seen something so smooth before.


anti demo activities


Scotland is not a real country according to soldier


That is slick indeed


Oh fuck off! You are way too good.


Those look backs occur insanely fast. How do you see anything and what is your build?


So satisfying watching rats get punished for being rats. Imagine getting clipped on for trying to go for a demo, I'd uninstall.


Smooth


Ankles = broken 🥶


This has to be one of the smoothest things I have seen in this subreddit. Damn


Very nice, generally if you're playing fast enough they'll never be able to catch ya, at least in upper plat/diamond matches


I'm silver and while a lot of stuff that happens in the upper ranks looks like it requires a LOT of practice, this clip is different and just doesn't make any sense to me. Like how does the car stay in the air for so long without seeming to ever boost upwards?

I think the only part of this I could do was the end part, driving without boost and hoping nothing interrupts me :D


I’ll have to do this in my next platinum game


I like that!  You wasted like 95 % of your full boost doin it tho.  What rank are you?


Clean af


Gorgeous!


The way you used your dodge to get back intothen the went into a micro airdribble was really cool.


[deleted]


Something about the boost meter is so satisfying to watch when you use it, I think it's the font of the numbers.


Yeah that high key turned me on


yeah me a boner the size of an east coast lighthouse


Came here to say the same thing


https://youtu.be/2gCk9yBBOUo

This will always be the best turnaround


Sure   
110   
270   
90   
\-4   
0.40   
6.90   
1.20


way more satisfying than a triple flip reset😂


woah there. have u seen the top freestylers’ clips? not shaming this clip, it’s insane, but …


Why does everyone have to make this comment? Always comparing the clip other shots.


Sorry, sir, but we can't do anything.  This was a clear cut case of self defense.  [If someone ever tries to kill you, you kill 'em right back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq7SGQzeCEw)!  

Shit, where'd my donut go?


\*clarification\* that was beautiful


lmaooo thx xD


ye i put a little spin on it by cancelling it kinda to the corner


Why??


Uninstall when it happens to you, reinstall when you see it happen to someone else : it’s a cycle


Shush xD


uhmm i pushed my stick a bit


The flip he used is a slightly modified speed flip. Thats how he was able to flip and gain momentum with his boost still being behind his car the entire time. More efficient and also faster, but requires more mechanical ability obviously. Takes some practice to get it down consistently


yea i almost missed


ikrrrrrrrrr


No


Probably because he's good enough to know he's not really in trouble and is trying to bait the other player into committing. I know I would not be able to do what he did and would stay away from putting the ball in front of my  own goal. If you lose control or screw it up you've just set up the other team.


it's how gif your game does it, it was indeed me


thanks :P 

cam v  
110

1.20


**QWERTY**


After the 360 short hop he was essentially facing forward with the ball in front of him. All he had to do was push forward a bit and flip.

The nutty part is having the quick thinking and reflexes to pull it off in game. Dude is so good.


Don't buy scuf. Garbage brand with a shit product.


Ps5 :) its soo good


Looks like a flip cancel.  Pull opposite direction immediately after flipping


Honestly idk for me its muscle memory but I think what j did was i first did a corner flip cancel and air roll to land on the ground


That what using 100 boost does lol


Yeah about 4k hours of freeplay will do the trick :)


I can't draw well but I can move my stick great haha! Thankuu


F


Uhm I just have it bound to R3 (clicking the right joystick) dunno why I do it prolly OCD lmfao


I didn't think it was possible to avoid demos now due to this. I've just been letting them happen because the harder I try to avoid it, the more often it happens


Reminds me of the guy from spy kids 3 dying lmao.


Nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) swivel speed


I was going to ask how am I supposed to read this because in the comment section it's just 11027090 etc etc but somehow I see the line jumps replying to it


What the hell is 110 270 90 - 4 0.40 6.90. 1.20?


Would this be the same across pc and console?


Who are you guys lol this was pretty good but pretty easy comparatively


IMO when I look at freestyler clips I think “this again…” or “flip reset double tap go brrrrrr”. This is fresh.


Freestyle clips are becoming dry tbh


i'd agree hah, you should see some of my other clips! hah


There are several individuals who peruse these forums, it is conceivable that one of them would like a specific clip more than every other clip they've seen. That type of comment just seems like a way to say "I think this clip is great." while adding a slight bit more.


Farva ate it


Such a clean cancel. Professionally done.


I pushed my stick a bit and had an entirely different result.


Lmao good one! The shot and the explanation


I thought that he did a canceled forward flip. Is that the same as a speed flip?


thanks a lot man


He flip canceled and let off early as well to bring the nose up. Super good control.


Do you have any specific button mappings or do you play claw?


And he let off the cancel a bit early to bring the nose up.


I’ll ask my wife if she will support me in this journey.


lol same I impulsively look back three or four times after my first touch


They really did just break demos even more then said they fixed it didnt they?


Spy kids 3? All the time in the world? Is that actually spy kids 3?


Oh my god the memories. You're so right. The Guy!


Oh I didnt notice lol, looked fine on pc


Minecraft coordinates


Camera settings


It may seem a Little different due to screen size (i play on a curved 24 inch) but having a different platform doesnt change anything ye


Easy, yes. But this was clean as hell


>Who are you guys

we're grand platinums


Which would impress u more in game tho outta curiosity. If your opponent at your ranked pulled this off, or whatever the top freestylers can do.


Disagreeeeeee


It must suck having everyone refusing to skip your replays from the sheer awe of these moves. You’re like those guys you see on holdmyredbull.


Truuuuuuu ima start saying that for all the basic Airdribbles i see posted here now


Ah, so a cancelled flip cancel (essentially). Thank you.


All i changed is air roll + powerslide on L1 and air roll left on R1


They made the logic of the demos more consistent so that you had to be supersonic to demo and not just a T-Bone or just being "faster than the other guy", but that in turn streamlined using demos as a competitive advantage.


Game Over is spy kids 3, The Guy is the name of a character


[deleted]


Camer setting


Cool! Thx for the quick reply lol


I disagree the fact that he used an entire boost tank was super unappealing to me. I hate using 50 boost for most moves half the time


Lol jeez I wasn’t putting anyone down just seemed like high praise. But hey if yall really loved this move thats cool too.


Idk about "impress" at my rank, but I can tell you that I'd be more intensely watching the replay of clean moves like this than the flip resets and double taps that I know all too well even if they're rare at my rank


With how much people practice specific shots, I wouldn’t be surprised to see something that looks crazy happen. I’ll just be upset that we’re 0-4 because he kept going for that shot over and over again lol. Seeing people with smooth ball control is something I’ve yet to see in plat-diamond.


Something tells me it doesn't get old to him.


I'll try that out, thanks g


OOOOH YEA

NOW I get it!


Not fine for everyone, no.


Came settin


He easily could have not, yes, but there was no reason for him too, it was a 1v1 so that ball was going in no matter what, so he might as well have put it in faster


I think yall are stroking his ego to much


Cam setti


Tru and it's probably the reason ill never get good at 1s but ima be honest half the cleanness in this clip probably came from him using all the boost so the ball stayed close the whole time


ca sett


Don't even worry about it, I'm still plat in 1's while diamond in 2s and 3s, don't need to perform in 1s to do well, though it helps


c set


se


Not been in town in ages. Why have sky moved in to that big arse store


I’m confused by some of these comments, i didn’t see anything pro Hamas or hear any of that. Fyi I’m literally wearing a poppy and a cross and wasn’t part of todays march. We wear the poppy because they died for us so we could protest. I wear it proudly. I’d be more alarmed if i seen swastikas. Not people protesting people shooting children.


50% off in Sky! It looks like a good deal but I’m surprised it attracted this much of a crowd


Who’s making all these flags, brother business is boomin


Don’t know what’s better: seeing so many ordinary people turn out to voice their solidarity or the delicious schadenfreude of how much seethe is produced in response.


Every time I see a pro Zionist comment condoning killing babies, I wonder if they're one of those people that are being paid to spread propaganda 

Do these people have no morals? Sold your soul for money.


Nice work Glasgow 🙏🏽 great to see people out on the streets supporting the Palestinian people across the country 🇵🇸


Fair play to all the peace protesters and all.

But to the fucking absolute cunt who cornered my other half on Ingram St almost interrogating her trying to find out if she was Jewish, stating how he hated Jews and spouting some shite about Oliver twist, fuck you and your small minded, ignorant life. Flat cap wear arsehole.


I think Hamas has to be wiped from the face of the world.


in London far right football thugs support Israel whilst doing nazi salutes on the terraces


Good on them,


Hell of a lot better attended than the one a month ago...

Great to see. Wish I could have been there.


Sick of the feeble middle class Weegie attempt at humour with these home made signs. Not funny.


The only way Israel will agree to a ceasefire if Hamas no longer exist. If these protestors really want peace then why don’t protest against Hamas?


No, it's pro hamas and the raping of young girls/women and the decapitation of babies.


Good to see footfall up in the high street.


DW guys, I heard from my IDF contact that a demonstration in Glasgow is REALLY gonna make them rethink their policies alllll the way over is Israel


disgusting


If only Hamas allowed the Palestinian people to move freely and not use them as human shields. 

The hate and anger I have saw within small groups in these marches is frightening, the demonstrators have been marching for what 4/5 weeks maybe more? 

What have they achieved?


No they don't. And let's not forget, Israel supply 10% of their water and 50% of their energy.  Meanwhile, you have Hamas leaders living like millionaires in Qatar.


[deleted]


It’s a joke. Terrorist attack an Ariadne Grande gig and everyone gets butterfly tattoos and sings Live Forever with Liam Gallagher. When happens to Israel and therefore Jews somehow now they are to blame and people march in de facto support of the terrorist. Don’t tell me it’s not anti semitic. Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better. But I’ve read this book before.


The march in support of the people/religion that hates our way of life and will absolutely brutalise the entire non islamic population the first chance it gets.


6,500 civilians were killed in the Syrian civil war last year, another Muslim nation like Palestine. Where are the protests? Palestine is a bit faddy, ken..  a fad.


1. Lolling at the one guy who brought an Iraqi flag
2. Love the Kufic design in the last picture


Shouldn't people be protesting like this against the cost of living crises ? And shouldn't the first minister be more concerned about Scotland than Gaza ?
Where were these people when Assad killed thousands ? Where were they when Pakistan massacres Hindus? Where were they when S Arabia killed and kills millions in Yemen ?


Love it, thanks for going and calling for an end to ethnic cleansing and for a ceasefire


Sick of these protests. It's contributing to fanning the flames of hatred towards Jews under the guise of pro Palestine sentiments.


ITT, bots and goons


No being funny but what's this got to do with Scotland and what are they hoping to achieve?


Totally unsurprising that the only trouble came from the far-right today.


Can someone explain why they are protesting in this country? We are not responsible for Israels retaliation, nor can we stop it, it’s nothing to do with the UK and cannot tell Israel what they can or can’t do!


I used to be full on pro Palestine, but I've seen a definite shift in how this issue is being depicted in online spaces - not this demo though mind, and it really put it all in perspective for me.


Even though I believe in peace for the region, I refuse to march for a ceasefire when I can not see it having the slightest positive impact.

Ever since even before 1948 the Jews in Israel have felt surrounded by enemies and in fear, this has led to a bit of an abhorrent attitude from many leaders and other groups, but that doesn't make all Isrealis, fervent zionists or islamaphobes. I fully believe Jewish people deserve to live there, and it would be ignorant to think a large portion of Muslims feel the same.

Neither the West nor the Muslim world seem to want or be able to make fundamental changes to the ruling parties in Palestine. Abbas is said to be richer than Netanyahu, and yet we hear of the terrible conditions in Gaza and the West Bank, Amnesty sees both Fatah and Hamas as oppressive regimes, so the Palestinian people aren't even free when not under Isreali attack. So let's have a ceasefire to only have dissidents disappear and homosexuals beating in jails.

Neither side is willing to accept a 2 state agreement. too much blood has been spilt, and far too much greed and violence from both sides.

What is the point of a ceasefire? Hamas will just arm up for this again, and no one will make headway on any decision.

The situation is just beyond fucked, I can't see a way out and I am on no ones side apart from the innocent s, both Palestinian and Israeli who suffer because of all of this.


Rather be woken up by this than an Orange walk


Was a great turnout & incredible to see how standing against a genocide rattles all the right people. Free Palestine 🇵🇸


It’s quite sad how quick this country has moved to forget all of the horrible acts Hamas committed prior to these recent events, and how they are able to push away clear video evidence of rocket systems in schools etc. and not condemn any of it. None of these people were protesting during the Syrian war when 4,000 Palestinians were slaughtered, or the 2,500 slaughtered by Lebanese militias and yet only do it when Israel does. Both sides as bad as one another but to ignore the horrors done by one side in favour of another is pure insanity, these people need their heads wobbling


Sneaky PDR photie


I’m sorry but Middle Eastern wars aren’t my problem. I haven’t posted anything for Palestine because what is me posting about it going to do? Save the children in Gaza? I don’t think so


I never see any Saltires or Union Jacks at the pro Palestine rallies...


My personal highlight was seeing someone shout abuse at the protesters only to be arrested by about 8 police


Wonder what these idiots will be marching about next month. They must have got bored with Ukraine


And not a peep on the Scottish BBC news website about any of these Scottish demos today but on a lighter note you can vote for your favourite strictly couples


Virtue signallers who all had Ukraine flags up until a month ago.


I wonder why there are no protests about what the Chinese are doing to the Muslims in China. Hmmm


Fuck Palestine🥱🥱🥱


Guy with a clear anti-semitistic sign (word Israel with pound signs replacing the Es) just milling around with no one challenging him.

Edit: Downvoting someone pointing out a very racist sign is a weird thing to do


This country has fallen so far from even 15 years ago. Mass importation of hateful anti Semitic Muslims mixed in with a weak feeble minded population who would at this point support basically anything they're told to by social media. Not at all surprising obviously just a nice reminder that the most vocal folk in the streets are the biggest rats. Fuck Hamas.


I still can't believe people are supporting this, the world has gone mad.


Look at all the men there, they’re protesting wanting to have us go and do something for them but I don’t see them on a plane off to do their part in Palestine and they wouldn’t take the option if we give it to them.


Deffo pro Hamas and antisemite demo. Go Israel👍🏻


Why the fuck are they expecting to get out of this 🤣 fucking bellends


I just wish both sides would keep religion out of it. As is, these rallies are becoming places for people to endorse Jihad/Hamas and celebrate Hitler.

That's the real problem now. Because those camps have been given legitimacy. Anyone wearing rainbow colours isn't safe there.


Glasgow has been conquered 😫


a good incentive for hamas to continue committing atrocities.


READ THIS! 

Completely switched sides after actually reading the history

For MANY years I was staunchly pro-Palestine as an American left leaning person. I never really did much of my own research, and had a bias against Israel because they are strongly allied with the US. (As a leftist, my view on American foreign policy was that pretty much anything the US involved themselves in was bad or questionable. Which, was not a completely unfair assumption, but one that I never fact checked) 

I had thought that after WWII Jews were essentially given Israel, kicked everyone else out, and then the US defended the borders. This was my assumption based on the way people talked about Israel as colonizers with US force behind them. Then I learned in passing, in a completely different setting that had nothing to do with the Israel/Palestine conflict, that Jewish people were actually in the area first! Before Islam even existed. Then I learned that they always had some presence. That started splintering how I felt about things. Nobody ever talked about how Israel actually had a valid claim to the land. I know this is dumb now, but I truly thought that a random place had been chosen and it happened to be where Israel now is. I was vaguely familiar with the significance for Jerusalem, but I am not religious at ALL so I didn't critically think about it.  

Then after Oct 7th I was so horrified and finally sought the story from the very beginning. I sat down with the assumption that Hamas were just terrorists that didn't actually represent the Palestinian people, and that Palestine was a peaceful country. 

Then I actually read from the beginning, like starting from the 5th century to the present day, and I realized why its called the "Israeli DEFENSE Force." This whole time, the media I consumed painted Palestinians as total victims but I hadn't realized that there was SO much violence from Palestine/other Arab countries. They originally invaded and conquered, they were hopeful that Hitler would be successful in exterminating Jews, that tons of Jewish people were also displaced from Arab countries, that they were originally offered a two state solution/ refused to collaborate, attacked and then LOST. So many things. Palestinians taking refuge in Syria and Jordan. Causing civil wars. Assassination attempts on the king/other people. That Egypt closed down the border because Palestine was sending in like 4 suicide bombers every week. That the US only began supporting Israel AFTER Israel successfully defended itself from another unprovoked attack which resulted in Egypt sinking tankers into the Suez Canal as revenge and causing an oil shortage in the US. I spend hours on wikipedia clicking though all of the sub stories of the conflict and I honestly could not believe the story had been so successfully spun to view Palestinians as victims. 

Victims even though they voted in Hamas, and that Hamas still has a lot of support in Palestine. I associated terrorist groups with fringe groups, unrepresentative of the sort of middle ground regular population. Imagine my surprise when I learned they were ELECTED! And that Hamas received a greater proportion of the Votes than Biden did in the US election. 

I've increasingly grown less sympathetic to followers of the Islamic faith over time. I struggle to find religious groups that produce as many fanatic murderous supporters that are willing to act on it as Islam. As a whole, the religion is very homophobic with quite a scary amount of Islamic people fully agreeing with some reallllyyyy fucked up shit. I've noticed how strongly religous Islamic communities tend to create problems where they go because they don't integrate super well into European countries who are secular and have a really good thing going BECAUSE of that secularism and western values. I feel like there is something going on with conservative and deeply religious sects of Islam where there is truly no compromise with western values or the western world because to them the consequence is their personal eternal damnation. It breeds such toxicity and extremism. 

Anyways. There it is.


On a day like today no respect.


I wonder if any of those lot think the jewish military give the slightest toss?


Evry week theres marches fur shit . Like its gona make a difference . Unless its on ur doorstep jst leave the marches oot


Love these photos, keep them coming :)


The whataboutist cunts are out in force in the comments. Absolutely can't stand to see someone do something about anything, always gotta bring up something else about somewhere else to try and defeat the point.

Making your voice heard in such a way is a valuable part of democracy, and cunts in Westminster ought to take notice of it. However, too much vested interests in their own geopolitics and deep pockets to actually care.


Proud  !


I hate fascist, xenophobic people


What did this achieve, exactly?

Apart from getting lots of terrorist sympathisers out in the open so they can be identified, that is?

Did it deflect a single bomb? Convince the Israelis or Hamas to stop fighting?


I support the latest thing!


Can you show an after pic?


This is absolutely disgusting


Israeli intelligence thought that multiple convoys escaping the region and following the route they themselves told them to go, were Hamas?

Israel thought that multiple housing blocks, hospitals and schools were all Hamas. 

I don't think you realise the level of destruction that's happened here. 


Anyway, I'm don't talking to you. I'm nursing a killer hangover and just can't be arsed. 

Take it easy.


Antisemitism is alive and well.


Get the border agency AND the DWP down there and the streets will clear. 👍


I love the, obligatory now, ‘Yer Da Sells Avon’ placard.  This one aimed at Rishi Sunak.

Beautiful..


Still yet to hear any pro Palestine person condemning Hamas


About a regiments worth of fighting age males in there, shame they are milling about in the UK claiming benefits for their 12 kids.


This is such a complexed and horrible conflict. Trying to stay from it as there is clearly many experts on this sub. One thing I can’t get my head around is if Israel wanted to absolutely flatten Gaza, they could, but they haven’t yet, why?


Remember you can show solidarity with the civilians of Palestine and not be a supporter of Hamas. The Daily Fail was doing its usual hate mongering again today, don’t fall for it. Civilians don’t deserve to die on either side of this war.


Disgusting

People Make Glasgow Very Dangerous For Jewish People

If this was an anti war rally I'd potentially be there. Instead it's a crowd of hateful people and useful idiots. Many people there have been manipulated into emotion, and lack knowledge on the history of the region.

Bombing civilians is terrible either way. It was very, very telling how quiet these Glaswegians were after Hamas massacred Israeli civilians, in comparison to how vocal they are in reverse


Wonder how many people on the march are in favour of a two state solution


Well at least we found the real source of Sunak's family wealth.


I’m ashamed of my hometown for this. Scotland has really lost its way.


🤮


🫡🇵🇸


Appalling people exporting their hatred and problems all over the world.


Disgusting. Terrorist supporting filth.


I wouldn't say I'm a fan of Israel per se but we kind of need them as they act as a barrier between the islamic world and the civilised world.


Fuck Palestine, Hamas and all of its naive left wing supporters, you have no idea what they all really think of you.


I'll be placing an order with yer Da Rishi......cheers!


Hamad supporters I guess


genuine question. how does it work? what's the response/result?
edit: so nobody can tell if there are any results at all. I know why they are there - I attended these "protests" some 20y ago and I see that nothing has changed. I asked what they have achieved so far? nothing again?

Hamas needs to be absolutely crushed for the atrocities they carried out last month. Once that's accomplished then the PLO needs to take over in Gaza. This would appear to be Israel's entirely reasonable goal. They could go in all guns blazing and flatten the entire place. They aren't. They're showing restraint. I'm not sure if western nations would do the same if faced with the same threat.


You mean pro Hamas demo


This things gonna happen every week now? 🙄


Whatever your views are, Israel will obliterate the Gaza strip. I don't think people realise what the IDF and Mossad are capable of.


The enemy within!


Clearly Israel is committing war crimes but the pro hamas/  anti semitic hate on the London march yesterday can't be ignored. Islamists don't care if u march for them. They believe women  are property and hate gay and trans people.


I still can't believe people are supporting this, the world has gone mad.


Whats the point of marching in the country the wars not happeing in💀💀


"the enlistment of a part of the American and European Left in the defense of the most radical form of Islam—what one might call the neo-Bolshevik bigotry of the lost believers of Marxism. Having lost everything—the working class, the Third World—the Left clings to this illusion: Islam, rebaptized as the religion of the poor, becomes the last utopia, replacing those of Communism and decolonization for disenchanted militants. The Muslim takes the place of the proletarian."


Asking the real questions


It's not that big, they only seem to be using a small part of the overall footprint of the place. I think most of it must be lying completely empty.


They got permission to turn it into a wee arse one


not a clue, walk past it every week and there is never anyone in there


In Glasgow it seems so, but London was very different. There’s loads of videos of people shouting “Kill the J*ws”, wearing Hamas regalia, chanting for violence against Israelis, people with Taliban flags (wearing jeans funnily enough) and other such stuff. I don’t think most of the people were wanting violence nor supporting Hamas, but there were definitely significant numbers. That’s aside from the actual physical violence from Pro-Palestine marchers. 

I agree that the right to protest should be protected, but I personally believe that comes second to our right to remember our war dead, whether they be British or Commonwealth troops. They can co-exist, and I think they did on Saturday, but there blatant signs of disrespect to our monuments shown as well, such as men standing on the Machine Gun Corps Memorial, wrapping the statue in their flag. This is a step too far for me personally, and i’m really quite agitated by the lack of response the police have had so far.


I'll be honest I'm not a huge fan of both sides but a few weeks ago whilst in town I saw numerous banners/boards saying "Israel shouldn't exist" or something along those lines which made me feel somewhat uneasy.


The problem with the call for “free Palestine” being aimed at Israel (as per the many signs) is that Palestine has never (literally never) entertained a peace deal or two-state solution. Israel has offered such solutions many times (this even after several Arab invasions of Israel (Yom Kippur, 1948 invasion, etc), yet Palestine rejects them all without interest and continues to act as and under fundamentalist Islamic terrorist groups; groups who explicitly call for the death of _all_ Jews and make that their mantra according to their scripture. 

I am for freeing Palestine; freeing them from the evil that governs them and has kept them from ever negotiating a peaceful solution.

Edit: _and_ fuck Netanyahu, he’s a war criminal whose actions I condemn.


Palastine  democratically voted for Hamas, you can down vote but that's a fact,


Having lived in the region for a number of years (and being able to speak Arabic) I can tell you most of the region and the majority of Palestinians support Hamas. Hamas’s charter is to kill all the Jews.


Pro Palestine demonstrations started immediately after Hamas's attack on civilians.


How many in that peace march were waving Israel flags? How many condemned Hamas?


Bet you didn’t see anyone denouncing hamas? And there in lies the problem. Marches every week where 100’s of thousands fail to denounce the ones causing and who caused this. Aggressors have become the  victims and victims are being called the aggressors. And for no reason other than it’s Jews on the other end of it. If you attend the march most Jews will see you as pro hamas. Theres nothing else we can think. If you have denounced hamas and gone on a march in support of the Israeli victims ill apologies. But bet most haven’t. So pro Hamas it has to be for me


Anyone chanting from the river to the sea is calling for the destruction of Israel.


You think 20 year old boys in the 1940s died for your right to protest? Where does this nonsense come from. And they certainly wouldn't give two shits about an ancient religious war in the middle east.


my favourite joke conspiracy is that flag makers fuel the tensions in the north of ireland to make money.


A long-term goal of mine is to set up 'Mohammed's Flammable Flags and Effigies' online store, but I would need a distribution partner in the Middle-East.


If it is a peace protest, why aren’t they waving Israel flags too?


It doesn't matter which is better; we get to enjoy them both!


Ordinary people turning out? Nothing ordinary about being a terrorist sympathisers. Muppet.


The conversations usually go like this

“I don’t support bombing of children in Palestine by the IDF”

“So you support terrorism?”


Are you protesting for Hamas to release civilian hostages? What about the babies that Hamas have murdered


Pretend you're Israel: what would you have done after 7th October?


Wtf did I just read


Why do you think Jews want to kill babies? Have you ever heard of blood libel?


Unit 8200 is working overtime!


You support murdering of babies? Was you out protesting hamas slaughtering those kids?


I want peace too, but this is why I would never walk with these people. There are enough people who think like this among them, and then have the audacity to claim that they're not anti-semitic.


Supporting Palestinian people and being against Israel isn't the same as supporting Hamas.


I think Israel needs to stop killing civilians


Yeah and the way to do it isnt indiscriminately killing civilians


Slaughtering children and bombing hospitals doesn't help accomplish this, it does the opposite.


The biggest recruitment drive for groups like Hamas is collective punishment and indiscriminant bombings of entire families.


Even if the Hamas use the ceasefire as an opportunity to attack, that should not justify the Israeli forces killing thousands of civilians.

I am not pro-palestiniens or pro-isreali, although I sympathise with the Palestinians and recognise their slaughter. 

I'm pro peace. 
All I want is the violence to end.


Every people on earth have their own army, sometimes multiple armies. But when Palestinians have some sort of small "army" you people can't stop crying about it.

Okay sure, let's magically take their army from the, but only if we take out every single army on earth too.


They weren't supporting Israel. They just turned up to fight police and get drunk and chant about being English. Like they do every time there is anything happening. If it was a pro Jewish march they would turn up and do Nazi salutes, too.


Was genuinely incredible to see, and good to be at and away from the frankly ridiculous online discourse we’ve been subjected to this week, saw lots of folk with placards mingling with folk with poppies on, just an atmosphere totally at odds with what a lot of people were clearly hoping for. As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago what struck me again was the very visible, very vocal female presence, also a lot of the chanting beforehand seemed to be aimed against Netanyahu specifically (as it should be).

Edited to add: enjoying the downvotes from bedroom dwellers wanking off over today’s footage of Tommy’s boys drunkenly fighting the Met, I’m sorry Glasgow didn’t deliver the violent clashes you’d hoped for.


Because the idf are the ones who have killed pver 11000 people, 4000 of them being children


The problem is the war didn't start on the 7th of October.

Palestinians have had to accept their citizens getting killed yearly for decades including kids, they have their houses bulldozed to make way for Jewish settlements, they get shot by the IDF for protesting against this, they get killed for sport by settlers whilst the IDF looks on. They are barricaded from getting to their businesses, their farms are set on fire.


As a Jew, what you wrote makes complete sense, every country and their people condemned Islamic extremism when they commit barbaric acts in other nations.

 You would expect a country to respond to a terror attack on with brutal force to eliminate whoever was responsible, especially when their rhetoric is the destruction of the state of Israel and its people. 

They want a ceasefire. These protests would be more useful if they wanted Hamas to surrender and release the hostages but are chanting that?

Of course not, Jewish/Israeli and international hostages are not even in the minds of those people. Sure, no one wants to have innocent people killed in Gaza but since their governing body has insisted on war, they now have it.


Civilians dying is bad actually. Generalising an entire people being massacred as fanatics who will murder us all is not the Gotcha you think it is, it’s fucking psychotic mate.


not at all its been going on 75 years unlike syria . Israel is ally of the west hence the protest against our governments support ......Syrian government  err is a ally of Russia and Iran .....

UK parliament voted against intervention in syria which was a difficult decision but probably correct as we could not stomach another Iraq or Afghanistan .


Why weren’t these protestors waving Ukraine flags when Ukraine was invaded?


Our country doesn't support the Syrian government in killing its own citizens.

In Israel our government does support it.


Or the thousands of Muslims in concentration camps in China, or the tens of thousands of Christians murdered by extremists in Nigeria (I say this having met a priest in Dundee who was later found in a mass grave after being murdered by Boko Haram). I get having an interest in a particular cause, but why the massively disproportionate support for *this* cause


Muslims killing Muslims? Just another day in MENA and to be expected.

Israelis defending themselves? How dare they! 😤


To the tune of Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves?

Edit: Guess my shite joke was properly shite rather than being ironically shite.


Britain arms Israel


Some Scottish people have a proud history of taking a stand politically on international matters, from apartheid in South Africa to General Pinochet in Chile, or the international brigade against Franco in Spain during the 1930s.

Ultimately it’s a free country, so people can peacefully protest about whatever they like. And a substantial portion of the country have a social conscience that stretches beyond the country’s borders. 

If enough people did something, the government would be forced to listen. That would involve taking the protest to London however, because they don’t give two fucks what’s happening up here.


All part of spreading global awareness and showing support to a crisis


Nothing and nothing.


Whole of the middle east is in a mess, Egypt, Syria, Iran. Ghastly things happening. Why does Palestine take precedent? Loads of Syrian civilians killed in civil war last year, woman still stoned to death in Egypt. Iran, let's not go there. Journalists dissapearing in Saudi (umong other horrid things). World ain't perfect. Let's focus on getting Scotland sorted then move to the rest of the world.


It means fuck all tbh.
Means nothing. Making self-righteous cunts feel better about themselves.


Nothing lol same with the anti trump rally. pretty embarrassing that people care more about this than things happening in their own country. People like to be in with the crowd and post social media pics. I bet 99% of them couldn’t even tell you why the wars happening.


Sadly predictable too


Imagine thinking that the UK has nothing to do with the chaos in the middle east lol


Would you be spouting the same nonsense if this was for ukraine?


Ah the classic "you'll never hear about this thing that's top of the BBC News website on the BBC". A particularly unsophisticated version of conspiracy theorism.


I definitely read a big write up on BBC news like 2 hours ago which also had pictures from this event in Glasgow.


Think you can support Ukraine and Palestine not really sure why there would be a conflict 👍.


It's the same scum who had BLM up before that and then quietly took them down when it became common knowledge that it was a scam.


Not spoken about the fucked up shit that happens in the continent of Africa in a while either or Ukraine.

Just to be clear all the downvotes you'll get here are folk who love that Hamas killed those Jews. They revel in it. They are hateful. They cheer dead Jews. Think about that. Absolutely disgusting but here we are in Glasgow in 2023.

All true. 

There have been over 48,000 Islamic terrorist acts  since 1979, which is deeply unsettling. And yet, the Left has adopted this movement as the proletariat.

Aye, it’s a shame so many of them currently form the Israeli government


I hope you were at this protest with the many other like minded people then


Like Hamas for instance?


I’d ask a question would supporting the black population in apartheid South Africa be considered as racist towards white people

That doesn't mean that Israel has any right to commit a genocide.

Happy now?


I condemn Hamas. Does that work for you?


Get fucked


It's funny in early October this sub would upvote comments critical of Hamas and those that were sympathetic to Israel's right to defend itself. Now we're pretty much back to the status quo. Was always going to happen after Israel responded. Back to the "Free Palestine" party line conveniently ignoring the fact that most of Palestine support Hamas, and ultimately supporting their end goal of eradicating Israel.


Shame you're assuming stuff about random people, while you can't even be bothered to learn how to spell.


Get fucked


From a Jew: quit ur shit.


The British government didn't make excuses for the slaughter of civilians by Hamas.

The British government is making excuses for the slaughter of civilians by the IDF.

That is why there are anti-war protests now, the nature of which you are cynically mischaracterising.

I agree


Well said, and ignore the downvotes, just dafties with an agenda of hate.

How can anyone pick a side, (in a war they actually know fuck all about) ,when civilians from both sides are being murdered by madmen on both sides?


Israel.


Are you stupid?


Shill


They want our Government to call for a ceasefire and exercise whatever influence it has with the Israeli Government to push for that. Just for example, we're a major arms supplier, we could withold arms shipments to the Israeli government until they agree to a ceasefire.


They want a ceasefire, which is fair enough. 

But even with a ceasefire to potentially talk things over there is no long term solution as Palestine cannot peacefully co-exist with Israel as they feel they are entitled to the land Israel occupies, so they will attack Israel for it. Israel will then use this as an opportunity to justify constant attacks.

In the end, Israel is the stronger country, with more powerful allies. An Israel takeover of Palestine is a foregone conclusion at this point. I wouldn’t be surprised if a large portion of protesters are there to appear virtuous like we see with a lot of these protests.


Just a bunch of people virtue signalling


What is abhorrent about demonstrating for the end of a war, and to encourage Israel to stop murdering thousands of innocents?

And before the hatred, Hamas are filthy terrorist scum who need wiped out from this Earth, but not at the cost of targeting civilian areas to do so.


Get a life, you absolute fud. 

Or go read a book. 

Or go outside. 

Fuck, do anything that will get you outside and actually become a rational thinking human with common sense.

In fact, don't go outside. You are probably fucking bowfing.

What a load of shite


There was the clip of the girl in the Celtic top abusing jews whilst reminding them about concentration camps. Slowly, very slowly these bigots are making hamas socially accpetable, even on this forum. I just replied to one who prefers Hamas to Isarel.


That is a common opinion held by some Jewish people, who have also been protesting the actions of Israel.

>To describe “Israel shouldn’t exist” as a common opinion amongst Orthodox Jews is factually incorrect. The opinion does exist, but don’t confuse a very vocal extremist ultra orthodox minority view with that held by the vast majority of Jews of every persuasion.


"not a fan of both sides" is wild.


Ppl don't like the truth


>Palestine has never (literally never) entertained a peace deal or two-state solution.

Why should Palestine do that? How would you feel about some randomers (from a completely different continent, at that) who fanatically claim their right to your house coming and forcibly evicting you out of your own home and then you'd be expected to put up with a 'peace deal'?

>Israel has offered such solutions many times (this even after several Arab invasions of Israel (Yom Kippur, 1948 invasion, etc), yet Palestine rejects them all without interest and continues to act as and under fundamentalist Islamic terrorist groups;

Factually incorrect. Israel has not been the one to 'offer' solutions: [the UN offered whilst Israel rejected the proposal by forcibly taking more land than proposed](https://youtu.be/zE8GCX1w3ys?feature=shared).

>groups who explicitly call for the death of all Jews and make that their mantra according to their scripture. 

What groups do that specifically and what's your evidence for that claim? You seem to be conflating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism which are two completely different terms.


In 2006. The median age of Palestinians is like 20.  Most living Palestinians did not vote for hamas

> Hamas’s charter is to kill all the Jews 

Are you sure? I am not a Hamas fan but I don’t see that on [their charter.](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/hamas-2017-document-of-general-principles-and-policies?utm_content=cmp-true) I do see this:

*Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion. Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine. Yet, it is the Zionists who constantly identify Judaism and the Jews with their own colonial project and illegal entity.
Hamas rejects the persecution of any human being or the undermining of his or her rights on nationalist, religious or sectarian grounds.*


In wit region? Pollokshields? I walk the same pavements as them 😂


Do you treat all things in life as a dichotomy? Or are you literally incapable of thinking with any nuance? Perhaps go down to the streets and ask them to denounce Hamas, and maybe they will. Hundreds of thousands of people don’t all need to share same worldview to protest Palestinians being murdered.

1,400 Israelis are killed and 240 in captive is a horrific, yes and nobody denies that. The matter at hand is that the IDF is currently murdering and displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians. The number of dead children is rising by the day. That’s worth protesting. 

To your point. If I come across a mass of people supporting Israel for whatever reason, should I treat them all as complicit to war crimes if their protest don’t also include what’s happening in Gaza?


Well no thats true i didnt.


Nice gaslighting bro


Because they think Israel shouldn’t exist, it’s a very widespread belief held by the Muslim “anti-Zionists” *ahem* anti-semites


Thick as mince.


*Ecce Homo*


It's like they're taught from a script how to respond


You forgot to have an accusation of antisemitism


haven’t seen any real evidence of Israeli children being killed but I’ve seen countless videos of dead Palestinian children. Just a couple minutes ago I saw a 7 year old girl get both her legs blown off. Not really a Muslim or an Arab myself but I don’t need to be one to see that it’s horrible things happening to Palestinians


Thats a very harmful generalisation - unfortunately there are bad people in every group/sex/race/religion, just a fact of life; to denounce all of them because of a few arseholes is why they’re all under the thumb anyways


That's the thing with these marches. It's just some kumbaya shit. Obviously everyone wants peace but how do you achieve that when the elected government of Palestine enters Israel and murders 1400 of it's citizens? Should there just be no response? There's literally no response Israel could enact that would be acceptable to these people.


Palastine voted in Hamas?! When I Jewish girl was raped and killed in gaza those lovely people spat on her


Innocent people all over the world are being slaughtered in greater number and with less justification than this. Have you marched for them? Have you f*ck. If you attend these marches you are either 1) supporting hamas, 2) anti Semitic or 3)a selective ignorant hypocrite. Let’s be honest, for most it’s probably a bit of 2 & 3. And it’s ethnic bullying, plain and simple. Of a race that has been ethnically bullied for millennia.


Yes it is because those people support Hamas.

Who do you think funds them, put them in power and helps build their tunnels?


Support Palestinians by removing Hamas. 
After being voted in they then killed the opposition and ended democracy. Doesn’t that sound like the main oppressor citizens of Gaza should be freed from?


agree, hamas as well


Do you think Hamas should stop killing civilians too?


The way people think this wrong is very concerning


Maybe if Hamas didn't hold the Palestinian civilians in front of them, knowing it makes Israel hold back. 

How do you propose Israel remove Hamas without inevitable civilian casualties when all their bases and hideouts are under civilian areas that they don't let people leave?


Isreal is doing a fine job at creating the next generation of Hamas fighters


Entire family bloodlines have been wiped in the past month alone. Truly evil pigs.


Uh yeah, I’m sure most people would want the violence to end. Saying that sounds pretty, but doing nothing and wishing for it won’t make it happen. It’s a terror organization that wants to destroy the country. I agree that Israel’s wanton destruction is excessive, but they don’t have the liberty of wishful thinking like westerners far removed from the conflict


LOL, this is truly deranged.

Whenever armies cross borders to conduct attacks on foreign soil, war is necessary.


Tommy’s boys?

Isn’t his name Stephen?


Women do tend to latch on to social media trends.


There were some pretty unsavoury chants of "From the river to the sea" when I jumped on the subway at Hillhead earlier. I gave the protestors the benefit of the doubt that they didn't know they were chanting anti-semitic hate speech.


“Very visible female presence” -  I wonder if these women would like to live in patriarchal regimes run by Hamas or their paymasters Iran, where women are third-class citizens.


How many has Hamas killed? And now they’re hiding behind the population, using them as a human shield. 

Do Hamas care about the loss of civilian life?

Why don’t you condemn Hamas?


It makes me sick when they all avoid this. It's shameful. It's grotesque. If you point this out to them they don't ever answer. Just...crickets. 

And they never give a crap about anything else. If Jews are involved, they go ballistic and start declaring even an Israeli soldier sneezing near a palestinian donkey an act of Genocide. 

But all over the world from China to the Middle East to Africa there are horrendous conflicts between and involving Muslims, and there is not a single shit given. 

Which can lead to only one conclusion. It's because there's 'jews' involved. I am LGBT and I thought these people were my allies, too, but they will drop every value and side with jihadists if it means they can kick the Jews after their 9/11, and also kick America/the West for being 'oppressive'. They aren't on my side and they aren't on the side of many people who they claim to stand for.

I just wanna say, the Jews don't stand alone. While these people are vocal, they are still an extremist minority of far left and islamist conservatives. They can turn out in the rain till the cows come home and it's not gonna change anything or give them what they want. They live in a virtue signalling fantasy world.


Spot on!


What about Yemen?


Fair enough. I do question all of the news though. It's incredibly biased from both sides. This is unfortunately the day and age we live in. People need more education. Instead of youtube videos twitter videos, most of which are doctored/played by actors, why don't they head over and see what's going on? Reality is no-one knows what it's like there unless they've lived there. So we're all just playing to what we've been fed by the media. Eat it up kids, Hamas are winning the media-influence war. Probably half of their aim was to get the world talking and demoise Israel.


I think we all know why


We arm Saudi Arabia. 400,000(!) have died in Yemen where Saudi Arabia is fighting a proxy war against Iran. Been going on for years. Why aren’t you marching, along with British Muslims, protesting about that? If it’s loss of life that fuels your determination to march/protest, then why ignore Yemen? Or Sudan? 

No, it seems ONLY THIS conflict drives you to protest. Protesting about war is admirable. Protesting about ONLY ONE PARTICULAR WAR is questionable.


They don't give a fuck about protests in London, either.

Remember Iraq? 

They let you have your little tantrums then do what they were going to do anyway.


They better off going Israel and protesting there. They are the ones pulling the trigger?


I bet you most of them do care about what’s happening in this country, and are far more likely to have been involved in other political activism. 

Maybe if more people gave a shit and got off their bahookies, things would change. Much easier to sneer from the sidelines or be apathetic than get out on a chilly afternoon and voice your support for something.


Found the big Write up here it is in full   "Away from London, other pro-Palestinian protests have taken place today including in Cardiff and Glasgow.  
Protest in Buchanan Street, Glasgow"


It's odd when Russia supports Palestine and Ukraine Israel.


They were silent when Assad was literally murdering Palestinians. Their motive is a hatred that only extends to Israel, not a love for the Palestinians


Even if it’s meant to have a double meaning, it’s clearly Anti-Semitic unfortunately.


So your a racist, okay then. I don’t care about your opinion


How about both are bad?


I have to correct you here because that's not true. I was one of a number of people who made direct contact with the club about it. 

Also important to note that the majority of people who will have seen it on the day wouldn't have known it had Nazi symbolism on it, unless they happened to know what a totenkopf is.


Never seen anything nazi related at Ibrox in my life, truthfully. Would like to think it’d be immediately challenged.


What about???


That’s just fucking nonsense


Please leave, we don’t need you here


Yeah totally. It's her who turned me into a racist. Nothing at all to do with the behaviour of the cunts I hate. Defo not that. Aye, all her fault.


A fish ? Obscure slur to fling out. 🐟🐟🐠


Well what’s their end goal?


Still true tho


Which bit is wrong?


“Rishi sunak, yer a bawbag!!” Level patter


I condemn Hamas


If they cared so much about their homeland they'd go back and fight for it not disrupting people's lives 3000 miles away with meanless protests.


No you get fucked. How are women, homosexuals and Jews treated in Arab countries?

They are the biggest opponents to human rights on earth. The abuses that occur in Arab countries is disgusting


You being Jewish doesn't mean anything,  I'm having my opinion


Exactly! 


(Still waiting on my order book back)


[deleted]


No, but clearly you are. How do you square away supporting Jewish genocide but claim to be against Muslim genocide? Or are you ok just a leftist moron who jumps on whatever bandwagon comes your way. This march is pro Palestine, not anti war. Palestine wants to eradicate all the Jews and you fucking idiots as standing there waving their flag. But I’m stupid. You are terrorist sympathisers and a disgrace to this country. You should all have been rounded up and thrown in jail, notice I didn’t say killed like you and your Palestinian friends are saying about the Jews. Utterly deplorable and a disgrace


thank you, I see that you are getting down voted too.


I'm sorry but making isreal stop isn't going to solve anything, hamas will just continue to behind their human shields and continue their countless attacks on isreal, it has went on for years. You can't expect a country to lie back and just take it when their citizens are being killed, they've tried using a lighter hand over the years but now it's just scorched earth. I agree that's horrible and terribly sad for the civilians of Palestine but what other options do isreal have exactly?


So all the bad guys have to do to avoid being targeted is hide in civilian areas then without fear of retaliation. Sounds good.


And to answer your question, it is abhorrent for us to demand isreal stop defending themselves and just accept the deaths of their citizens at the hands of hamas.


>Hamas are filthy terrorist scum who need wiped out from this Earth. 

You do understand that’s what’s happening in Gaza?

>but not at the cost of targeting civilian areas to do so.

There’s no other way, sadly. You can’t have one without the other.


[deleted]


Israel could destroy Gaza completely and totally and basically eradicate its population in a couple of days. They haven't done this. They've invaded it and are going after Hamas. And that's entirely justified.


The people you are referring to are the Neturei Karta, a fringe group of the Satmar, which itself is a minority within the Hasidic world, which is one part of the Charedi, which is one part of the Orthodox world, which is one strand of Judaism.

To describe “Israel shouldn’t exist” as a common opinion amongst Orthodox Jews is factually incorrect. The opinion does exist, but don’t confuse a very vocal extremist ultra orthodox minority view with that held by the vast majority of Jews of every persuasion.


Those people are absolute nutters. They don't want Israel because they think it's blocking the return and end times


It’s not a common orthodox opinion at all. If you’re thinking of Neturei Karta, they’re less than 100 people


Why? They’re both cunts


According to the 2009 Statistical Abstract of Israel, 50.2% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi or Sephardi origin.   These Jews  are a grouping communities comprising those who remained in the Land of Israel and those who existed in diaspora throughout and around the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) from biblical times into the modern era.  After the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War, most Mizrahim were either expelled by their Arab rulers or chose to leave and emigrated to Israel.


1) “Some randomers”? Sorry, where are the Jews from
natively? Where should be their homeland if not where they are actually _from_? 

2) Israel was willing to work with the UN - the offer may not have originated from Israelis, but Israel extended the offers of compromise as a solution (even for solutions that shrank their state _a lot_)

All Hamas has done with the UN is accept their aid and turn it into weaponry and hold it for ransom against Palestinian citizens. 

3. Hamas explicitly call for the death of all Jews, as per their interpretation of the Quran - it doesn’t take much research into them to find it in their own words - and they are the party governing Gaza and suppressing the Palestinian people.


Most Palestinians who voted for Hamas are dead.


Yeah point out the spellings ignore the facts , that will work


😂👍


Springburn tae gaza wtaf 😂


The Irony is that on numerous occasions serving Israeli politicians have openly stated that they want to Nuke the Palestinians etc and various Chief Rabbis have openly called Palestinians sub human, cockroaches etc.

But muh HAMAS constitution.


How can you interpret this?

>Hamas believes that no part of the land of Palestine shall be compromised or conceded, irrespective of the causes, the circumstances and the pressures and no matter how long the occupation lasts. Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.


They don’t care.  Zionists just wanna keep spreading their lies and propaganda.


Palestinian Authority Martyr Fund pays a salary to families of terrorists who have died while carrying out politically motivated attacks against Israel. In 2016, the Palestinian Authority paid out 1.1 billion to these families. 
Biggest monetary supporters of Palestine? The European Union.


Fucking hell.  This sub, man. 
Never thought I'd see someone trying to defend Hamas' open claim to wipe out Israel. Jesus (peace be upon him, the Mizrahi Jew).


Article 7


Hamas clearly don’t give any kind of shit about any distinction between Zionists and Jews dude. 

The entire history of the Middle East is Muslims and Jews fighting. This is just yet another fight. The names and PR don’t matter.


I’m a Jew who is struggling to process the  situation and your position is to double down with the nastiness. If that’s how I and 90% of Jews feel, that’s how we feel. You have illustrated exactly why we live with extreme nervousness and why (despite most not being a Zionist) we actually need Israel. I thought Britain was different in 2023. But maybe my lack of nuance has hit again here. 

And to your points. Firstly, many are denying that what happend is a terrible thing both actively and through silence. Secondly, I shouldn’t have to go and find and ask people to denounce a terrorist attack - you wouldn’t say this about any other minority. Thirdly, your point about Israel - you wouldn’t say this about any other victim in society. It seems Jews just don’t count.


Clever response sister


Lol


or if you mention that they’re civilian kids being killed

“BUt tHeY eLeCtEd hAmAs” like the kids can even vote lol


Going around denying the slaughter of people who you clearly don't like is totally unacceptable. Hamas is a terrorist organisation who actively set out to slaughter civilians of all varieties. The events in October were monstrous.


Best thing about you lot is you deny the children killed by hamas as propaganda etc.
I seen the videos from both sides and all children being killed is unacceptable. Only difference is that the unfortunate souls killed by Israel are collateral damage and those killed by hamas is fucking disgusting first degree  murder (least they filmed it for you to deny)


Don't worry they'd gladly do the same to you


Most of Palestine’s population weren’t old enough to vote in that last election. 

As for the response? Vaporising civilians is never the answer. If anything, Israel has just recruited the next generation of Hamas fighters.

But that’s what they want. Because you don’t have to pretend to negotiate with Hamas, you can use their violent outbursts as an excuse to annex Gaza.


The only way Israel will agree to a ceasefire if Hamas no longer exist. If these protestors really want peace then why don’t protest against Hamas?


More children in Gaza have died in a month than the annual number of children killed in conflicts across the world. The rate of which, children and people are dying in Gaza is far surpassing other conflicts. Have you organised any other protests for any of these other conflicts? Doubt it!


No is not. 
I assume you support EVERY creackpot in this country just because you live here, then?


Netanyahu does.  Go have a wee bit of critical thinking.

How else do weapons end up in a massive open air prison with the IDF guarding every entrance and exit


All armed groups should stop slaughtering civilians. Do you agree?


😂. The classic “do you condemn hamas?” 
Israel have killed 4000+ innnocent civilians. 🤫


Of course 😊. Do you have any other argument? Israel bombed a refuge camp and a hospital. More than a half of people killed in Palestine are children.


Imagine if Israel weren't holding back. They'd be bombing hospitals and killing journalists by now.


By all accounts, it doesn't make Israel hold back though, does it? In fact, they've been known to hold Palestinian civilians in front of them too


It doesnt make them hold back though does it?


Yeah you’re right. We should probably just let them keep trying to kill the Jews.


You occupy people, they will resist. Here we are 80 years later and they never stopped. Your wishful thinking is thinking  what you do is legitimate lol


Good point, he’s used that many different names while scamming his moron followers it’s hard to keep track.


The second line of that is ‘Let Palestine Be Free’.  You can check where this saying came from yourself, who’s said it and the context in which it’s been said over the course of decades.

Do that and decide for yourself what you think it means..


Wait until I tell you about what happened with Roe V Wade recently, or to immigrants at the border of America. I’m gonna blow your mind.


Of course, real feminism is when bombs fired by female soldiers annihilate the women in your family and you say nothing.


Whataboutism at its finest “oH bUt dO yOu cOnDeMn hAmAs tHouGh”, that just takes away from what the Israeli’s are doing, of course i condemn hamas but we are seeing the idf do MUCH worse, (read the higher death toll and 28 un convention violations) - idf has been seen (documented in video) using palestinians as human shields if we want to go down that route, stop your virtue signalling because if you think hamas has hidden behind all 11,000 innocent civilians then you’re a delusional idiot.


fair question I dont know the politics but its clear this is a 75 year land grab and a displacement of 2M people in process


head over ? my best friend was in Gaza 10 years ago roughly , when the last incursion was , he was embedded with the BBC but not a journalist , his wife a producer . He went along and witnessed . His photos of that time really opened my eyes to what's going on . After that war the IDF strictly controlled BBC / ITV /C4 journalists and today there are none in Gaza unless embedded with IDF where their footage is controlled ...Only Palestinian journalists are there and are being picked off one by one .....

Yes Hamas have a agenda encouraged by Israel who divided the original Palestinian cause under the PLO where Arafat and The Israeli prime Minister Yitzak Rabhin agreed on peace - the prime minister was assassinated by a right wing Israeli settler ..


That argument so idiotic. If you yourself are condemning the deaths of those in Yemen and saying it’s shocking, why don’t you support these protests?

Why aren’t you prefacing it with “I march for Palestine but I also march for Yemen”. Instead of using the deaths of these people as a way to devalue the deaths of Palestinians? What’s stopping you?

People speak out against the Saudis constantly. You just haven’t bothered your arse to look until you need to try and wield it against this situation.

What even is your point? Do and say nothing?


Let’s agree that’s it lies somewhere between a peep and a big write up then.


Think you will find Russia like china has neutral ties with both however Russia will see this conflict as a win due to the ongoing conflict in Israel.

It’s also odd how you seem to support one country that is being invaded where war crimes are being committed and not the other .


What is odd about this?

This sub supports the group that literally murdered 1400 Jews last month and wants to eradicate Israel. These "Free Palestine" marches also want to eradicate Israel. They just couch it in freedom fighter language. Tell me how you "Free Palestine" without getting rid of the Jews?


Is that what you would have said to him? Ok. So, what's your interpretation of his sign?


I dont believe a word they say to be honest


And I’m telling you to quit your shit. Thnxs

Also, it’s not a war, it’s genocide. Thnxs


Its people showing support for a country and the clear war crimes being afflicted on it. Not a terrorist organisation. Why can't you get that into your fucking thick head?


I’ll repeat the other reply. Get fucked.


Get fucked


Look at this madlad with peanuts for baws jumping on an alt to act hard on the internet. Fuck up


> notice I didn’t say killed like you and your Palestinian friends are saying about the Jews. 

You just said you hope they get blown up on a bus, ya fuckin massive wankstain.


What Israel have done absolutely dwarves any attacks against them and how dare you try justify the blanket murder of children to justify the means to an end.

They should never have been there in the first place.


Yeah, pretty much. It fucking sucks but if bad guys hide inside a hospital full of civilians, you shouldn't shell the hospital. Does it make fighting them more difficult? Yeah. The right thing isn't always the easiest thing, but it's generally agreed that if a bad guy is using a child as a human shield, you shouldn't just shoot the child because it's easier.


So that **really** is your argument?  You think it's just fine and dandy to kill thousands of civilians because the bad guys are doing bad guys stuff and hiding behind civilians.


It has a right. 

What it doesn't have a right to is leveling a region and clearly destroying civilian infrastructure with the clear intent to wipe them all out. 

Aka war crimes. 

Also show me the proof that Hamas are using an entire hospital, a traveling convoy escaping the region or a school as human shields that warrants entire classrooms of kids to be killed. 

Get fucked you Daily Mail reading fucking shitehawk.


It’s fucking not justified,  no matter what mental gymnastics you play


Right, but I think it's worth remembering that those people exist, and are very likely to have been the people saying what the person I replied to says they saw. 

Unless what we're trying to say is that Orthodox Jewish people's opinions are representative of everyone's opinion who doesn't support Israels actions


Yeah honestly this war has no "good guys"

The best way I've found to put it is, all this war is doing is determining who goes to trial and who goes to the grave


Does that include the 5000 dead Palestinian children that have been murdered in the last month?


Who is 'both' here and how are they 'both cunts'? One side is a settler-colonialist power that invaded the lands of people living there beforehand. Imagine some Celtic person who is now living in a different continent to you claiming that they've got right to your house because they're more Celtic than you and they force you out your house. How would you feel if someone called you a cunt for fighting back? I find it absurd for you to then claim that 'both' are cunts then.


>“Some randomers”? Sorry, where are the Jews from natively? Where should be their homeland if not where they are actually from? 

Where are Christians from natively? Where are Muslims from natively? Where are Celtic people from natively? What do European Zionists have to do with a land that was under the rule of the Ottomans for several centuries? How is any of that a reason for settler-colonialists to go and steal land from others? What's stopping you from giving your home to others who are 'more native' than you? The fact you fail to see the moral dilemma with what you're saying is seriously concerning. [Israelis/Zionists are not indigenous to the land that they've barbarically taken from the natives](https://youtu.be/FhlUFPpXIVo?feature=shared)

>Israel was willing to work with the UN - the offer may not have originated from Israelis, but Israel extended the offers of compromise as a solution (even for solutions that shrank their state a lot)

[Counter-argument](https://youtu.be/zE8GCX1w3ys?feature=shared)

Why did they end up taking more land than proposed and why have they got illegal settlements (as confirmed by the UN and Amnesty International) in Gaza and the West Bank?

>Hamas explicitly call for the death of all Jews, as per their interpretation of the Quran - it doesn’t take much research into them to find it in their own words - and they are the party governing Gaza and suppressing the Palestinian people.

Proof, please.


This is likely factually incorrect. The life expectancy in Gaza is 75 which is higher than neighbouring Egypt. Considering the fertility rate it’s likely thay over 95 percent of the voters are still alive.


A good point. We all hate Hamas for killing civilians, but it seems not all of us carry this same standard over to the IDF, who actually have a worse ratio for civilians killed. Another interesting point is that the IDF using Palestinians as human shields was only made illegal a few years ago by their Supreme Court and the IDF fought tooth and nail for the practise not to be banned. Another irony is that there are a few thousand Palestinians detained without trial or charge (administrative detention), which to me, is just another way of saying kidnapped/taken hostage.


Hamas are *actual jihadis*, though? 

I think Israel deserve tremendous criticism on various fronts. But I sometimes think people don't understand what Hamas is. Hamas is waging holy war, and have brought the most abject misery to Gaza. Gaza unquestionably needs to be free from Hamas, who have taken billions in international aid and spent it jihadism.


Hamas's charter contained explicit calls to kill all the Jews until it was amended in 2017, to be just for the total destruction of Israel instead. 

I don't know about you, but I doubt that Hamas suddenly became non anti-semites suddenly in 2017. Their leaders and followers all continually call for the murdering of Jews, and still call for the total destruction of Israel but any means necessary, including terrorism aimed at civilian Jews. 

Whether their charter says "we hate all Jews" explicitly is not really relevant, because they do anyway.


Could say the exact same thing about Muslims. I can tell you chapter and verse to look up what their god wants them to do but we all know that you will ignore it


Why won't you denounce the murder of innocent children? What the hell is wrong with you?

Stop supporting genocide.


Idk man, sounds like you're willing to simplify what's happened so you can slam dunk on people, instead of taking a genuine look at the situation and realising that there are 100% innocent people in both sides of this that are either, being taken advantage of or simply targeted for who they are.

Like dam, I'd think a religious person would understand simple concepts like the sanctity of life but I guess it's just RvB and that's that, no nuance, no nothing


Next, 'even though they're kids, they probably will become Hamas in the future! It's preventing future holocausts to kill them now!!'

And they won't put together what causes some people in Gaza to support Hamas


I don’t care about Jews , why would you assume I don’t like them? Im neither Arab or from the Middle East.


I just simply stated from my POV I haven’t seen any meaningful evidence of children being beheaded like the claims were made but there’s countless video evidence of Palestinian children being massacred. 

Everytime child deaths in Gaza  is brought up all people say is “but do they condemn Hamas” or “well they elected Hamas” but they’re fucking children who can’t even vote yet they’re being bombed to shit. 


There’s also countless videos of Jews calling for death to Arabs. If you want proof, I’ll leave a link here. 

Yes we all agree that Hamas has done some very fucked up shit but the IDF have much much more blood on their hands lol


Clear description about how you people view the Palestinian lives. 


Palestinian kids die “collateral damage”

Israeli kids die “ first degree murder” 


Not to mention over 20x more Palestinian kids have died.


They also conveniently leave out the fact that Israel funded Hamas as an opposition to the PLO to divide Palestine further - they just don’t like that it backfired


Elections? 
You’re talking about elections?

Last election was in 2007
These people are using residential building blocks to shoot missiles and you are concerned about the population not having the chance to vote 🤣

Like.. do you think that they’re gonna vote to the parallel of Nicola Sturgeon if they’ve only had the opportunity?

What arab country actually has proper democratic elections btw, would you care letting me know?


Tell me how you eradicate Hamas without harming civilians.


Not sure but I saw thousands palestinians on the streets that looked very happy when hamas paraded dead women's bodies.


Dresden, hiroshima and nagasaki would like a word


This is bullshit.


That’s BS


It's Palestinians building tunnels into Egypt to smuggle weapons ya rocket


Any armed force should make all possible attempts to avoid civilian casualties. But some people, either intentionally or through ignorance, struggle to distinguish but regrettable collateral damage, and intentional slaughter. 

Hamas puts civilians in harms way. Hamas intentionally targets civilians.


Do you don’t think Hamas should stop killing civilians?


They didn't bomb that hospital, is that lie still circulating? 

Also, journalists embedded in Hamas who work for papers like the NYT were there taking photos with the Oct 7th attackers. That's not a journalist, that's a terrorist with a camera. 

There is a difference between a journalist getting hit by a bomb hitting a terrorist's base and taking out a journalist covering attacks.


>In fact, they've been known to hold Palestinian civilians in front of them too

Far fewer cases and often the perpetrators are prosecuted by an actual military structure rather than rabid terrorist cells.

And it absolutely makes Israel hold back. Why else would Hamas force civilians to stay put around and above their bases? Because either it makes Israel not shoot, or they can use the resulting deaths to garner support from useful idiots.


Why do you think Hamas forces civilians to stay in place and shoots at them if they try to leave? 

Because they know it makes the IDF's job harder, who have to work to minimise collateral damage.


Exactly. People holding guns are making a choice. People who are pulling triggers are making a choice. People who are setting the bombs are making a choice. 

A choice that they could protest individually. 
A choice that weighs their lives against the thousand the bomb intends to kill.

They choose violence. 

The type of revolution that needs to happen is the one of individuals recognising their own agency in this situation on a mass scale. And rebelling themselves against the 1% at the top calling the wars, and against the terrorists

But both terrorists and leaders have indoctrinated and brainwashed the people. It will take a Mira levto happen. 

But that is the leave required.


If you actually read my comment I said that it wasn’t legitimate, that it was excessive. The Israeli occupation caused this conflict obviously, this is not some new insight. 

But there’s nothing to be done for it now. If they did nothing Hamas would simply continue to attack them, so what are they gonna do? Bomb them, and as long as the US keeps backing them, they will continue to do whatever they want until hamas is gone or surrenders. 

There is no possibility of coexistence between Hamas and Israel. At this point I doubt the possibility of coexistence between Palestine and Israel. Israel will probably force a mass exodus of Palestinians, similar to how Middle Eastern countries forced out all of their Jews. Idk how else this situation would end. It’s basically a war of conquest that Israel started back in the 40s that never ended


In Arabic the chant is "Palestine will be Arab".

min al-mayeh lil-mayeh, filastina arabiyya

It's an explicit call for genocide against the Jews who love there.


I know where the saying came from. I also know what groups use it now and with what purpose and intent.


The first line is the important one - it's the one used by anti-semites (including Hamas) to call for the elimination of Israel and the Jews living there. No reasonable people should be using that chant.


Why do you fannies type with capital letters in the middle of words?

The reason why more Israeli citizens aren't dead is because they have the IrON DoMe.

WhAt a fUd.


Hamas have been seen using Palestinians as a human shield. They also have taken innocent civilians hostage.

Do Hamas even care about the lives of Palestinians or does Hamas see them as collateral damage for their cause?


It does seem to be calming down now. But over the last maybe ten year 150k people have been killed. Nobody talks about it.


How's it a land grab, Jews have lived in the region continuously for three thousand years.


Sorry but no still sticking to my first comment this report is on the UK news page not on the Scottish section of web site what is the point of breaking the local news by country then region if you are not going to report anything relevant to your area


Moscow had meetings with Hamas officials only weeks ago to offer support. 

>It’s also odd how you seem to support one country that is being invaded where war crimes are being committed and not the other

Russia invaded Ukraine unprovoked. If Ukraine had run into Rostov-on-Don and murdered tens of thousands of people indiscriminately I'd have a lot less sympathy for them, and I'd blame Ukraine for the resulting invasions brutal response.

But that's not what happened.


Surely it would be more odd not to support the Palestinian people if you support Ukraines fight from invasion.


I think you’ll find the main problem is that Anti-Zionist don’t know the difference between Israel and Jewish people.

Can you see how blaming Israel for antisemitism is twisted logic?


I’m not racist. If you don’t condemn racist signs I assume your racist and/or part of the problem. Be a better person


I think you’ll find the Israel government reduced that to 1200 today. Check out the Balfour declaration, Israel are “eradicating” Palestine, how can you not see that? Or are you wilfully ignorant?


Good question 🧐!


By calling for a cease fire, ending their occupation and letting Palestinians live in peace. Too many have died. 

Since the atrocity on October 7, which killed 1,200 Jewish people [(not the exaggerated 1,400 that was previously announced)](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-revises-death-toll-from-oct-7-hamas-assault-dropping-it-from-1400-to-1200/), the oppressive state of Israel has murdered [11,078 Palestinian men, women and children](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/israel-revises-death-toll-from-october-7-hamas-attack-to-1200-people) and displaced over 70% of Gaza’s population through the bombing of their homes. 

“The Jews” aren’t responsible for this genocide. The Israeli government are, and they need to be tried for war crimes.


Yeah that’s what I would say.

It’s very obvious what his sign means.


What do you mean by stop my shit? What is "my shit?" Me having an opinion?


Are you sure you're Jewish? Calling it Genocide suggests otherwise


Look at you throwing insults as you defend Hamas’s actions. Says it all.


Still waiting on the proof Hamas are in hospitals, ambulances, schools, etc…also, if Israel knows where Hamas are hiding couldnt they just go in and get them? It’s almost like they don’t actually give a fuck about Hamas


I have no proof that hamas were using those locations, all I have to go on is that this is that isreali intelligence believed hamas cells were based in those locations. You also have no proof to the contrary, if you do I'd love to see it.


I'm sure Jews in Israel would say it is justified, in fact they do. Hamas want to destroy Israel and eliminate the Jews from the middle east...That seems like a good enough justification for any nation to respond to a clear and obvious terror threat with all necessary force.


The life expectancy of people born today. Look at a population pyramid of Gaza, or the median age, and get back to me.


The live expectancy in Gaza isn't 75. If it is, prove it


So why are Hamas hiding amongst the civilian population?

Genuine question… Do Hamas even care about the lives of Palestinian civilians?


You're being downvoted for literally providing facts that don't fit a narrative. That's staggering.


And Israel has been murdering and displacing Palestinians since 1948 - whats your point? 

Also, are you saying you don’t want government officials to move their stance? They hate Zionists, and Israel only exists because they ethnically cleansed Palestinians in 1948 and force them out of their houses - you support an ethno state? . Israelis hate all Palestinians and that’s why they are carpet bombing them, and have been murdering them for 70+ years, and keeping CHILDREN as illegal prisoners.


You considered that you just don’t understand the text? Have you actually looked into those verses, at the exegesis, scholarly commentary etc? What about verses such as 60:8? I suspect you aren’t that stupid but just have a dislike of Muslims that biases your view.


I’ve not blamed the Palestinians for anything. I blame Hamas. You don’t know my thoughts about the Israeli government either. Making massive assumptions on my religiousness, my politics and my intentions. While all the while not accepting any point at all around how Jews  are being persecuted yet again. There are no justifiable causal issues for racism. And it is racism. And the existence of the Jews as a race is at the very core of this. No other minority is treated in this way - fact. If I don’t stand up for me who else will? Not you. Call me what you want, misconstrue my intentions, try and misalign the issues for internet points. When I make a point of how I feel as a Jew I get accused of using anti semitism as a stick. It’s literally an impossible debate. All I know is we don’t feel welcome anywhere and the one solitary place we are welcome, the majority of the world wants to destroy. 

Because I say this doesn’t mean I don’t value the lives of  Palestinians. All I want is for everyone to live their lives in peace and prosperity. Palestinians and Jews (not just Israelis - this is a key differentiator) can’t do that for numerous reasons too complex and too nuanced for anyone to comprehend. And why can’t I voice support of Jews on here in the same way hundreds of thousands are supporting Palestinians in the street without it becoming an attack on my moral credence. And who says you can’t simplify things. The double standards is astounding and it’s deep seated in age old cultural anti semitism and ethnic bullying as far as I’m concerned. You would never say such things to any other minority.


If I saw my parents blown to bits at 9 years old and half my friends bombed to death at 10 years old while actively living in a warzone I would probably consider joining a terror org too


>I don’t care about Jews

the mask slips.


>I just simply stated from my POV I haven’t seen any meaningful evidence of children being beheaded like the claims were made

That's a lie. You said you questioned whether children had been killed at all, not beheaded.


Genuine question… Do Hamas see the death of Palestinian civilians as collateral damage? Do Hamas even care about them?


You are a fucking idiot


It didn't backfire though, they've got almost the entirety of the west backing their ethnic cleansing that they've been pushing for since the nakba


Invest in Gaza’s healthcare, education and infrastructure and respect the rights of the people there. Offer them a genuine political pathway out of the situation rather than running an open air prison. Respect existing international treaties and offer a few olive branches. 

Well-fed people with aspirations for the future and a political voice find terrorism less appealing.


You're a fucking idiot if you think any of those atrocities solved anything

So holding back they still managed to murder 000s of women and children. 
FFS sake it's coming out now that the IDF could have killed the majority of civilians on 7/10!
Helicopter pilots couldn't tell difference between Hamas and civilians so opened fire on both.
When tanks arrived at the kibitz they opened fire on houses full of civilians.
IDF ordered the soldiers on the ground to kill everyone!
Yeah and that was them holding back!


It’s absurd to think that someone fighting an asymmetric war against an occupying force should, would, or could use conventional means. 

Let me guess, Hamas should build their HQ in a bit of waste ground and write “Hamas HQ” on the roof? Then all collectively stay there so that Israel can wipe them out with a single US-bought, UK manufactured missile?

Why don’t Hamas just walk towards the Israeli sniper turrets with their handful of Soviet-era weapons, and let Israel melt them with their $300bn worth of military kit they’ve had from Uncle Sam since 1948?

Get real. 

I suppose the resistance in France c.1940 were also scumbags for living with their families? Or the Viet Cong?

The lack of context and feigned naivety in these posts is disingenuous to say the least.


11000 dead, so far, including babies in incubators is minimal collateral damage to you?

Cos to me it looks like the IDF is totally ok with killing civillians.


You're getting downvoted by Redditor's clearly not assed about the rights of Jews, but will clap like demented seals for a cause dominated by crowds of islamist heavy lunatics, happy to gloss over the hideous shit hamas did.


Because you lot are fucking idiots thats why; israel are targeting civilian populated zones and UN protected zones so no wonder why so many people are protesting - then you have wankers like you who are on your knees with your virtue signalling. Oh btw, zip netenyahu’s trousers up when you’re done big boy


maybe the people who are in the know about these things should talk about it more then, instead of when something else comes up being like "well what about Yemen? 🤓"


What meetings?, like china they are trying to negotiate as they are seen as neutral parties is my understanding.

So what your saying is if the IRA blew up a building with 250 people in it that would give us the right to kill tens of thousands of Irish people as there is loose evidence to suggest that they are living amongst the innocent population. 

Israel has a greater responsibility not to act like terrorists as it’s capability of destruction is 1000x more destructive than anything Hamas could do. They should go after the individuals responsible absolutely.

But that is not what is happening it’s collective punishment and is a war crime as has already been stated by the UN.


There are idiots everywhere. The fact is, the vast majority of us know the difference between Israel and Jewish people. 

Fuck the nazis, but Germans are fine. Fuck Israel’s actions, but Jewish people shouldn’t be condemned (unless they’re Zionist’s, at which point fuck them)


>Israel are “eradicating” Palestine, how can you not see that? Or are you wilfully ignorant?

Israel has existed in the region for 75 years and the Palestinian population has more than doubled in that time. Pretty rubbish eradication if you ask me.




>Yeah that’s what I would say. Fine. 



>It’s very obvious what his sign means.

It wasn't immediately obvious to me, but now that I think about it, I'm guessing it's going for the Jewish stereotype? Is this how you interperet it?


Yeah, your opinion is shit. Therefore, quit.

>Also, are you saying you don’t want government officials to move their stance? They hate Zionists.

Hamas openly wants Jewish Genocide, don't pretend otherwise. 

>And Israel has been murdering and displacing Palestinians since 1948 - whats your point? 

The surrounding Arab and Muslim countries initially tried to murder all Jews in the region, and then murdered their own Jews or expelled them to Israel. Then they launched multiple wars to wipe them out, is it any wonder that Israel kept winning and deciding not to give back the land they took to people and countries who kept trying to murder them all? 

>Israelis hate all Palestinians and that’s why they are carpet bombing them,

Israel's population is 20% Arab Muslim, and growing. They're not doing a very good job of removing or killing them.


When you say murdering you mean killing the people who declared war on Israel with the goal of murdering all Israelis

And when you say displacing you mean not letting the Palestinians move back after their attempt to murder all the Israelis failed.

Before the war many Palestinians fled so it was only Israelis that remained, understandably the Israelis were upset at purposefully being left to die and never let the people that abandoned them move back as of nothing happened

>Bet you didn’t see anyone denouncing hamas? And there in lies the problem. Marches every week where 100’s of thousands fail to denounce the ones causing and who caused this. Aggressors have become the victims and victims are being called the aggressors. And for no reason other than it’s Jews on the other end of it. If you attend the march most Jews will see you as pro hamas. Theres nothing else we can think. If you have denounced hamas and gone on a march in support of the Israeli victims ill apologies. But bet most haven’t. So pro Hamas it has to be for me

This is actual Hamas propaganda that you have eaten right up. It's absolute horse shit nonsense with absolutely no basis whatsoever other than people desperate to make out that Hamas aren't as bad as they say they are.

>So what your saying is if the IRA blew up a building with 250 people in it that would give us the right to kill tens of thousands of Irish people as there is loose evidence to suggest that they are living amongst the innocent population. 

Haha "loose evidence". Are you saying that there is only loose evidence that Hamas is building bases, tunnels, and weapons caches below hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas? It's iron clad, set in stone fact. Not loose evidence. 

>Israel has a greater responsibility not to act like terrorists as it’s capability of destruction is 1000x more destructive than anything Hamas could do. They should go after the individuals responsible absolutely.

Yeah it does often. You might support them going after these guys individually, but that would require Israeli special forces invading Gaza and secretly killing or arresting these guys in their bases surrounded by thousands of civilians who'll try to protect them. That too would be seen by many of these protesters as Israeli occupation regardless.


>Fuck Israel’s actions, but Jewish people shouldn’t be condemned (unless they’re Zionist’s, at which point fuck them)

You can be a Zionist without supporting the current Israeli government or their actions. You can be a Zionist and condemn the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians. You can be a Zionist and want a peaceful two state solution. So f your sweeping statement.


Jesus, you still at it?


Associating Jewish people to money is a racist stereotype as old as time.


No

This says a lot about you and your values on freedom of speech. You're literally trying to control my speech you can fuck off


🥲 how pathetic of you.


Okay, so you’re against 1 genocide that never happened, but okay with one that has been on going since 1948?


hamas were created/funded by israel to oppose the PLO. hamas are literally a product of israeli oppression in a literal and metaphorical sense. your fight should be with the ongoing genocide of palestinians rather than a hypothetical one of jews that hamas aren’t physically capable of committing.


>You’ve been everywhere idf sympathising

you are a lunatic it seems.

>im pretty sure they said the same about arabs too (to indicate impartiality)

i wasnt talking about them, i was talking about you and your throwaway 'i dont care about jews' comment.

anyone decent person cares about innocent jews and arabs.... that rules you out apparently.


Go fuck yourself, prick


Them and so many others, it's really disappointing. Hoped we were better than this.


You're supposed to ask for a source, idiot.


They actually did kill a lot of civilians so whats your point


So you support indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas even though the collateral damage is horrific. 

Scary your just walking about the street.


Strong retort


Lmao, you’re so dramatic. Am I holding a gun to your head and demanding you stfu? Didn’t know I wielded so much power 💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻


You have a point but *yawn*. I miss the old world.


Isn't it fucking brilliant. 

Now away to yer basement ya goblin.


>Okay, so you’re against 1 genocide that never happened,

Only because Israel has been well supported by the west. If you want western support financially or militarily to end, then you're inviting the surrounding countries who are openly genocidal to attack and actually carry it out. It's also never happened because Israel has invested heavily in actually *defending* it's people with the Iron Dome and other defensive capabilities, bomb shelters, and response teams to deal with the indiscriminate and random rockets fired daily into Israel, hitting hospitals and schools. 

And no, Israel has been the victim of attempted genocide since 1948, where most of its population comes from being expelled from their land, then attacked on all sides by multiple countries intent on its destruction. 

"It never happened" because they were incompetent, not because they were unwilling. 

With Israels existence, Palestinians have grown in population, both in Israel, and in the west bank/Gaza.


This is the worst genocide attempt in history if it's been going on for 75 years and the population has more than doubled.


>that hamas aren’t physically capable of committing.

They killed over a thousand only a month ago, and have said they're totally gonna commit attacks like that at the first opportunity. 

If you're fine with people being openly genocidal and hateful so long as they have no capacity to carry it out, I'm sure that's a rule you'll follow for idiot Nazis in this country who have no capacity to carry out their hatred, right? 

>hamas were created/funded by israel to oppose the PLO. hamas are literally a product of israeli oppression in a literal and metaphorical sense.

Israel haven't occupied Gaza since 2005, and removed all the Jews from the area. Gaza has had the opportunity to become a well run city state by itself for nearly 2 decades, but they decided to vote for Hamas, and then spend their aid money on terrorism. Hamas have said so themselves that they don't give a fuck about the people. Their job is to destroy Israel, and the Gazans are the responsibility of the UN. 

Were the Germans killed in the Dresden bombings the victims of genocide when British bombers leveled the city to destroy the Nazi war machines capabilities?


They don’t like to acknowledge this fact.


This subreddit has been overrun by Zionists and bots the last month. The Islamophobia is LOUD.


>So you support indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas

It's not indiscriminate, and no I don't really, I'd prefer they didn't and I'm sad so many are dying. 

But I also understand that absolutely no other solution has been put forward really, and often that's because the people criticising the bombing don't really think Hamas are that bad...


Very good


You probably would if you could. But you can't so you do what you can online. Glad I gave you a chuckle but it's facts


Me too bud


You’re off your fucking tits, my dude.


israel pulling out of gaza in 2005 doesn’t mean anything when they control the borders and the food/energy/water supplies of the area. israel have been bombing hospitals routinely for the last few weeks and killed 10x the amount of civilians hamas killed. of course the october 7th attack was wrong but it wasnt unexpected. hamas are a product of israeli colonialism  and israel’s genocide is purely fuelling their ambitions. if i was a palestinian teenager and israeli bombs killed my entire family while they cut off my food,water and electricity i’d probably join hamas too. don’t support them btw just adding nuance.


You are so gullible. I wonder which books and historians you’ve been reading? I suspect none. The narrative you believe is a crafted narrative and I’d suggest you actually look at the historical records including Israeli archives. Look at the Zionist leaders from the late 19th and early 20th century and what they were saying. It was zionists who brought terrorism and bombing civilians (including Brits) to the region such as Irgun, Lehi, Haganah etc off the back of this ideology.

1947 the UN partition plan was proposed, giving most of the land to a minority population who only owned 6% of the land at the time. Then Palestinians were expelled from their towns and villages which were burnt, at the end of a gun. The Israeli army being made up by those same extremists that had been committing the atrocities in the decades before.

Palestinians have tried. UN resolutions. The Oslo Accords. The Israelis as a whole never accepted it. The one Israeli PM who was pushing for peace was assassinated in 1995 by extremist zionists for his efforts.

Gaza has been blockaded since 2006 with regular Israeli incursions killing mostly civilians. Starving civilians. Destroying water plants, power plants, not letting them have the materials to repair. Not letting them trade. An open air prison. The Palestinians were persecuted before Hamas and they will be persecuted after Hamas. It’s a poor excuse. The Israeli backed PA has authority in the West Bank but that hasn’t stopped checkpoints, violent settlers. Kids being detained and tortured by Israeli police. People held without trial. Amnesty international has an interesting 270 page report detailing why it is a system of Apartheid.


i understand the fear that hamas are going to wipe out jews i do get where it’s coming from jewish people have been through horrible atrocities but they are using this as an excuse to do the same to palestine. israel have said they will literally flatten gaza and kill everyone inside if they don’t leave (which they can’t) and people are still justifying this because of hamas’ old charter. it’s why israeli propaganda is so successful.


I hate guns so no. My freedom of speech ALSO reserves me the right to tell people to stfu. #equality

I thought he was going to make the doll twerk there for a sec


Toddlers have good posture when standing up.


can you show the effect of reverse cowboy vs. doggy?  my wife doesn't believe me.


Lift well and don't twerk, got it


You gotta jerk that spine


I think both ways would hurt regardless because of the giant person behind me sticking a massive dildo up my bum making me move


Either your back gets screwed or your knees will.

The best way is to just leave it there and move on with your life


It’s not a great example. You can bend over and keep your back straight.


The demo on the second one is not totally accurate because the knees are still bent. To break your back, the knees are kept straight while you bend over.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4epeIusue0


This is so outdated and spreads misinformations on how to take care of your body.


Ah yes, knees, the least injurable joints


Good thing our spines are not made of shitty plastic!


Your back will thank you - your knees will scream. Nothing escapes Father Time... ask for help.


So I'm supposed to lift the thing without the help of my back muscles? I hope it's a light charge


Funny enough, give a toddler a large block, they move it properly.
Give a 10 year old the same task they swoop in and use their back.


My knees gives up faster than my back.


Last year, I picked up a 2kg box wrong. I was too quick and jolted. I was in pain for a week. Nothing permanent but a great reminder that it doesn't take much. Always protect your back. Always.


This is dumb as shit, you understand that you have the option to not round your spine as you go down right.

You're not a helpless floppy cardboard model, you're a human with a nervous system and muscles and you can decide how you move.


Ok but, I'm fat. And when I pick something up it's not usually in a spot I can pick it up "properly"


One crucial mistake, our backs are not made out of wood.


Construction companies will certify you on safe lifting practices but 95% of the heavy items you need lift are oddly shaped or oversized and damn near impossible to pick up like this.


This isn't accurate at all. This shows no muscles to support the back at all. Yeah, if we have no support for our spine and it's just a link assembly to flop around then this makes sense.


Where can I get one of these??


Always lift with your back. It's the biggest muscle for a reason. I find lifting with quick sharp jerky motions helps as well


The only correct way to lift heavy stuff is to have someone else do it.


Lmao it kinda started twerking 5 seconds in


I understand that you're referring to difficult choices or situations. It's true that sometimes we face tough decisions, but it's important to evaluate the options and choose the path that aligns with our values and goals. Remember, seeking support from trusted individuals can often provide valuable perspectives during such times.


What so scientists have to say about it ? 🗣️


u/savevideobot


Scientific studies disagree with this.

If you are not trained enough to lift the load you are lifting, you will hurt yourself regardless of how you do it.

[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14763141.2019.1675751](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14763141.2019.1675751)


You can lift with your back in a healthy way. There’s a reason people do it weighted in the gym


So I found out recently that for super heavy things sure, lift with your knees. But for most things we should be lifting with our back. Because we’re weird when it comes to the back. Every other muscle we would say use it to make it gain strength. But the back we’re told to actively avoid using to protect it. We should be (in a managed way) trying to use it and strengthen it.


Now set it in the no position and make it twerk


I want this toy so I can make it twerk.


Make sure your mistress has a firm grip on the stick up your ass, got it.


Yeah bud your knees wont


My dmbass acquired lifelong injury at the age of 22 working for Amazon doing this shit. Trying to impress your managers for the sake of productivity is not worth it.

I was later fired during a Kaizen (logistics research project). The purpose of the Kaizen was packing shelves as full as possible with shit and the person I was working with took all the small items to boost his numbers and left a bunch of 32 pack mason jars for me to stow.

They did not give a single fuck. AND they sure as hell didn't pay for surgeries or medical care nor lost wages.

Moral of the story is capitalism is dogshit and as a laborer your body is only valuable until the labor value is extracted from it. Then you will be discarded


Why was I expecting it to shit in the bucket


Anyone with a small kid will understand that babies instinctively have PERFECT lifting form. My 1 yr old lifts things with the form of a pro power lifter. Not sure why we seem to lose/forget it as we get older


While I agree with the general premise, a field of study extending over decades and potentially hundreds of clinical trials and modelling studies cannot be condensed to a 12 second video of a wooden toy.


This is fear-mongering and a nocebo. With proper load management and training bending forward this is not an injury mechanic at all. The problem is not posture, but the back not being resilient enough to lift heavy at all.


Well it's a bit late now.


I read somewhere that unless it's difficult for you, there isn't any reason to choose a posture over the other. I think there isn't evidence that any of these postures cause back injuries or pain.

I could be wrong though. I don't remember well where I read it.


Wow. I thought we had actually moved on from this kind of misinformation. Our bodies are resilient and durable as fuck you guys. This kind of fear mongering is extremely outdated and proven to be false. You can live without fear of picking things up or the floor and not having to worry you’re going to hurt yourself. Flexion and extension are both totally normal and our spines can absolutely handle it.


That's a lame ass model that has nothing to do with where force would be coming from.  There's no giant muscle at that point. 

We've been bamboozled to think that you can throw out your back if you pick something up without bending your knees. Meanwhile tribal people that still know how to move naturally can work bent over all day by bending from the hip and keeping their back straight. 
Western science thinks they've reinvented how to move just like we've reinvented food and made everyone sick. The further we get from nature the more miserable we will be.  Stay away from the Dr and compromised system they've been indoctrinated into.  
Take control of your own health and tap into your own wisdom. It's getting ridiculous when most kids are obese and on medications. Wake up!

Edit: This is not the right place for this post but had to get some shit off my chest so bear with me.


I have those stupid kind of hips that I can't squat without falling over lol


Okay but I can barely get down into a squat, and if I do get down I can’t get up. Literally have to sit down and get up that way.


To me when I see people deadlifting in videos it looks like the second demonstration please tell me why I’m wrong


~~my back doesn't even said that~~


"Ya gotta LIFT WITH YER BACK! Ya tryna ruin my brand?"


Yea. Tried picking up around 50kg vegetable bag couple weeks ago..fucked up my lower back..really worried that this might turn into permanent pain..


ehhh, ok if i had no muscle that would be accurate


Can confirm. Just had a prolapsed spinal disc operated. Remember to lift with your legs kids!


Don't show this to the deadlifters. They may just implode


So are dead lifts just terrible for you then?


![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)


Try this when you poop.


What if we don't have tails?


That all and we'll but in real life lifting properly like this never works...or your luggage you travel with would be a 5gal bucket!


The way I see it, if you want to make arms stronger, you lift things with them, and if you want to make legs stronger, you lift things with them, so obviously if you want to make back stronger, you lift things with it.


make it twerk


That's me, BROKEN


I always lift from my butt plug too


But can they make it twerk?


I just want to see it twerk for some reason


Help. Now my knees hate me.


Now make it twerk


So ruin my knees, don’t ruin my back. Got it.


Next,., twerk demo.


Bullshit


Ayo?


Brilliant example


No joke, friendos. Lifting badly wrecked my entire life career sleep deal. You cannot imagine the pain until it's too late.


Damn Woody was twerkin heavy at :05


Bout halfway thru I thought things were gonna go in a MUCH different direction.


Currently dealing with the consequences


“Lift with your back!”


r/savevideo


I just leave stuff on the ground at this point


My guy threw it back for a brief moment


Now do that lift in less than second like most employers want.


But my knees are bad…..


 but my knees are more fragile than my back.


Need more demos like this to stay healthy, we don't wanna waste money paying insurance and pharma companies.


Now pick up a 900x2500 plasterboard and walk up a set of stairs with it and tell me how well that works.


and how the fuck am i supposed to be able to bend down like that?


My mind is so dirty I genuinely thought this was a showcase of a new sex toy


You’re supposed to lift while twisting, it’ll help you become more flexible like a gymnast.

^/s


He can do the thug shaker.


Is this a product. Where can I buy this. 

People in my life, small majority, seem to have an aversion to lifting properly.


Let others lift.  Check.


They just unconsciously built the world's first twerking doll.


Does it take into account muscle and weight training?


That kind of device induce kinesiophibia. Their use is not recommanded anymore in rehabilitation.


Except only olympic weightlifters have that level of hip and ankle mobility, and knee stability. No regular joe is getting into the first position and keeping a straight lower back. What they didn’t show is the second body position with the load still between the model’s feet which would be a much more realistic position for an actual human, and also avoid obliterating their knees.


Someone explain the romanian deadlift to me then.


But your knees wont.


This actually was very helpful. I never learned how to properly lift up heavy objects and constantly hurt my lower back. Thank you I finally understand


You're still going to destroy your back, but with good posture you can delay the inevitable.


Rubik's brand 🤮


Your back won't thank you for lifting the "correct way", look up actual studies on the topic and listen to some experts talk about it in detail.


easier to just demonstrate it with an actual person.


Thats cool


As someone who has back issues. Bulging discs. This little demo gave me a wow factor. Now I see the mechanics of improper lifting.


Damn the arch on that thing


"Keep item close to your chest." 

My JJJ breasts: lol


I wanna see it twerk.


Assume position


That's great if the thing you are picking up fits between your legs and has handles on it. Demonstration designed by an office cunt that never actually had to lift something big and heavy.


Don't use your back like a crane.


Also: do NOT twist your back while carrying something heavy.


I need to send this to so many people in my gym


It doesn't show any 'effect' though, simply the difference in bone motion. It's not about which motion as much as how you clench your back muscle before using them and how progressive is your charge loading. Basically, clench before lift, not while and increase slowly force. When bodybuilders lift large heavy balls, it's full bent to full stand and they don't shred their back doing so.


As a physio I always die a little inside whenever this gets reposted, comments are always full of nonsense and anecdotal misinformation


I hike often, have never had back issues and indeed lift/crouch like the first demo figurine. I have strong thighs and knees and flexibility.

However, people with bad knees may see this demo and just see pure PAIN. Also people who "lift with their back" don't do it because they enjoy the inefficiency, if you don't have the ability to crouch like *option1* and lift yourself up from that angle *without reaching with 1 arm for something to support yourself lifting from a crouched position* [much less when you're trying to lift additional weight] it makes sense that option 2 is (temporarily) easier to do. Lifting with ones back is more common, because option 1 may seem impossible for those who aren't trained to carry weight in that manner, and it also requires extra effort in the short term. I'm not recommending Option 2 "back ruiner" lifting, but I understand why people do it.


Ahh yes, great demo with infinite flexibility and properly proportioned limb ratios


Not just the back it can also weaken the core, cause impingements in upper back. Incontinence and more


Wow


I never used to really get it. Then I started squatting at the gym and got used to the form and now it makes sense.

I feel like lifting should be taught in gym class or something so they get first hand experience picking up boxes correctly.


Seriously, do you know where I can get one for educational purposes?


Actually, this is only true for heavier objects. Your back will get weak if you always do this. For example, the reason old people can't raise their hands above their heads is because they never do. Not my words. I was told this by a specialist.


As someone who lifted and carried for a job for 36 years 100% use the correct techniques *every time.*  
I'd also add; look after your knees! I didn't and can barely walk any distance now.


That's great if your arms and legs are only the width of your bones and the load you're picking up is narrower than your skull, but how the fuck am I supposed to use that posture when picking up a bag of cement/sand? Or a euro container with handles 500mm apart? Or my nearly 5 year old when he's throwing a tantrum??


I think my problem is my tail isn’t as big as the models.


Ppls backs are always hurting its because they lie to you..lift with your back not your legs you will get abs on your back like regular show


Moment arm, HIP DRAAAHVE


Also shows how to twerk


I thought it was going to twerk for a second


Don't deadlift like the first example.


I was distracted by the unsolved rubiks cube.....it's bothering me


I've never been able to get what the difference between lifting with your legs vs back is. Now I do.


So it's better to have a hand on my ass. Noted


When with the first method know your limit. I had the right method posture and i still strained the heck out of my thigh groin and lower back. Its been a week on ice packs…still sore im lucky i didnt tear anything that day


I want this


this poor stick man has to lift this block for the rest of life. lol


This discounts the arms though. Using your arms to lift when you have to bend over forward helps a lot.

Just don’t be jerky in your movement and don’t use your back as leverage. Our spines aren’t adapted well for constant verticality in the first place.


Is that what people mean by lift with your knees and not your back? I just thought you really put your knees into it...


For anyone who really cares about spine health, I recommend Stuart McGill's book: Back Mechanic.

The TL;DR summary is that it's all about stability under load and that's a trainable skill.


Last I talked to a chiropractor he told me that it doesn't really matter how you lift something, but what matters is how heavy it is. Most people injuring their backs from lifting is because they lift more than what their muscles are trained to lift. Sure, you can lift something super heavy one time, but this is usually the way people get injuries.


Now make it twerk. Lol


I got a hernia lifting the wrong way. Shit sucks. I now lift the right way


Yes, if you don't have any muscles in your back, like this toy, that is what will happen (not that lifting with the back is a good idea).


Throw it back, you little wooden man


You either work with the body's anatomy, or become just another old, fat cripple.

u/savevideobot


I didn’t know what subreddit this was from so I thought they were going to make it throw it back but still interesting


HE THROWING IT BACK!!!!


Yup- herniated a disc in my back at 23 lifting like that, had to have back surgery, still have nerve damage from it too.
Lift with your legs!


Well if you actually have a strong back you won't fold like the toy in the demo. Isometric flexing your low lumbar back into extention is perfectly normal and how you pick up heavy objects from the ground. Legs and back work together. Most people just have really weak backs from a sedentary life style.


At this very moment my back is fucked up from poor weightlifting form


I do back surgery.  I would LOVE to show this to my patients.


Except most things I need to lift at work are awkward. Activate bad posture!!


Thats very interesting!


Not really a simple toy though is it?


Thankyou


I can't squat that far down...

This toy lacks erector spinae though


Where can I buy one of those?


I thought it was going to do a twerk

Have a terrible habit of lifting with my back


he threw it back for a sec 😳


My back has never thankd me, ungrateful fuck


This is so oddly attractive


I use my arms though so zero strain in my back. My arms are strong so no need for legs or back☺️


Gym bros meet science bros


No one seen the pelvis gesture? Ha


I could probably lift more with that guys hand in my ass too


This is garbage. It can’t demonstrate an effective hip-hinge like doing a Romanian deadlift or rack pull. Which is much easier on your knees.


Stop vertical video syndrome.


I have such a dirty mind


I'd lift like the second if someone was controlling me with a stick up my ass


Very cool illustration…

I love the women. Oh yeah that’s me definitely


What if you lift heavy using your back? Are we different from people who don’t lift at all?


And when we can't straddle the object vertically, then it's a team lift


Knees, hips or back, you're gonna shred one. But I agree, do not pick things up like that


what if both my knees lock up when i crouch?


Ngl. Thought he was going to make it twerk


Your back will thank you, but your knees won't.  Looks like we have to sacrifice one of em. Choose wisely!


You will not stop me from picking up heavy pieces of metal and throwing them at babies


If it works you should also use it


Cool


Tell that to my knees


Damn I wonder if back muscles would help ease the tension on the spine, it sucks that we dont have any of those just laying around

Solve that rubiks cube or ill break your spine


But its not by your butt that you stand up


I'm genuinely curious why weightlifters don't follow this. I don't lift, but I'd like to try some day. I would need this question answered to even think about that "some day".


Either you break your back or your knee's, pick your poison

I have a bum knee I can't bend it


Is there anyway to make your back or spine stronger so doing this wouldn’t hurt it?


I work in EMS and we have to lift heavy patients all the time. One time, a Physical Therapist came in to show us how to properly lift patients during a class. He showed us proper body mechanics and concentrated on using the leg muscles and not our backs when lifting patients. He demonstrated on a nearly 200 lb rescue training mannequin in our EMS bay. His reoccurring statement was that there was absolutely no reason we shouldn’t be lifting our patients any other way. During lunch, we (the seasoned EMS instructors attending this required training) covered the mannequin in some vegetable oil and water and put it into an alcove tub in a tiny bathroom. We asked the PT to demonstrate again how to lift the “patient”, since absolutely none of our patients are ever just laying in a wide open and accessible area where multiple people can assist in the lift. Then we told him the patient was our mother and she had fallen naked in the shower and was bleeding after gashing herself on the broken ceramic soap holder molded into the tile. We encouraged the other students to scream at him to “help her” and “do something” as if they were other family members. Guess what he couldn’t do? He thought we were all being unrealistic and assholes, but that is pretty much how EMS personnel end up blowing out our backs. Especially when our patients push excess of 300 lbs and the people that seem to be entering the EMS profession now are 5’2” females that weigh about 100 lbs…
The lesson: Some people think they know it all right up until they get punched in the mouth.

But yeah, if you are lifting almost any object, keep it close to your body and use your legs, not your back. Until you get punched in the mouth (figuratively speaking).

Unsolved Rubik’s cube on the table triggers me

Wait till these people hear about RDLs


What about if you actually use your back muscles and keep your back straight?


This looks more like a demonstration on how to twerk correctly.


1. Imagine seeing someone pop a squat every time they pick from their garden.

2. Should this only be done for heavy objects?

3. Is it better to bend over or squat when you pick up a pebble?

That's the strangest sex Doll i've ever seen...

Where do I buy one?


Why he twerking tho


And now I have 2 ruptured discs and one herniated…


We actually need to be doing both, lifting lighter objects by bending out backs strengthens the muscles of the back, while heavier loads shouldn’t be lifted by the knees to prevent strain on those muscles.


I’ve always wondered why weightlifters don’t lift like this. The deep squat comes after they have already cleaned the weight to chest height.


Nice now show the pain in my knees when I do a full sit down squat to pick up a box


i want this


Hurt my back when I was 18 lifting like that so yeah that was very painful for months , guys lift with your legs always no joke


Fascinating


Let's pretend there aren't any muscles in the back to stabilise and keep it rigid.


I used this video to show my wife several good form techniques as well, thank you.


Curved back helps strengthen the muscles


Now show me the model throwing it back


Tom Platz would be proud ☺️


I try to lift things correctly but my legs are like " nah not doing that today "


I have bad knees now what?


Nice try-outs


Where do I get one


Its all about the weight. Using the full range of motion is important and healthy


As someone with full length Harrington rods and lots of other hardware in my back I can really appreciate this demo.


Too bad the first way kills my knees lol ... but who needs knees when your back is great!


Not me thinking he was gonna make the doll throw it back.


It’s not an incorrect way to pick things up, it’s simply because we don’t exercise or build up muscle on these muscles, look at weight lifters as an example, physios will often use techniques of improving these muscles and asking you to do exercises which make you lift things the “wrong way”

Now I WANT to see just that


Cause they got tiny stumpy legs so if they leant forward, they'd just fall over


Maybe. But they also constantly have to be picked up from the most inconvenient places - cribs, ball pits, wells, behind the couch, etc - killing their parents' backs.


They don’t have kneecaps


I watch my son whose 4 now and he’s always deep squatted. Blows my mind how he can just walk around and play squatting. Hardly ever on his butt or knees. 

Not sure if it’s a weight thing as we get older or just poor posture over time where we stop doing that.


The little ones know you have to lift with your legs.


It’s the default idle animation

I also have had sexual relations with his wife


Just good advice in general with lifting anything heavy: don’t drop it like it’s hot


I say this every time I see someone lift something heavy at work.  No one laughs.


No no no. That is just awful advice. You got to twist and jerk it.


Try more lube bro


Wrong. You make someone else move it to where you want it.


Construct a pulley


Your knees have the biomechnical capacity to move in the correct posture, your back in the incorrect posture does not.

With good form on exercises like deadlifts your knees will get stronger, not screwed.

because when you have a forklift, theres no reason to lift anything without it


Knees Over Toes Guy would very strongly disagree.


Honestly the knee part is worse for me. I never had back issues after lifting something heavy with a bend back but my knee hates me for trying to squat and and pick up my tennis balls.


Man, your knees must be super weak to hurt when you pick up something


You save your knees by squatting with flat feet.  Shoes with high heels make that hard though, let alone the fact that westerner's lose the ability to squat with flat feet without shoes due to the western style toilet.


Yeah, I hate when people try to correct me and I have to put weight on my bad knees.


I was hoping someone addressed your knees in this. Truth be told, a knee replacement is better than a spinal injury, but it’s a terrible trade off


Exactly, you can lift perfectly safely with your back, as long as it's straight. In fact, you can lift the most weight when lifting with both your legs and back. This "don't ever lift with your back" advise is outdated and plain wrong. You need to know HOW to lift with your back, instead of not doing it at all.


You'll only prevent back strain on the second lift if you have incredible core muscles and the thing you're lifting isn't particularly heavy. You might as well lift the proper way.


[deleted]


Stiffed legged deadlifts are fine if loaded correctly and progressively increased.


Aaaand youre gonna leave us in the dark on what the correct procedure is?


Thank you. I just left a comment I’m expecting to be downvoted but this kind of fear mongering is absolutely infuriating. You can lift things up off the floor normally you guys! There is no “correct” procedure.


Preach. Spinal flexion isn't dangerous. Monotonous heavy lifts are though.


Why are you acting like this is a completely made up scenario and not a representation of where actual back injuries can come from


I'm still a young'un but I reckon chronic knee pain would be slightly more bearable than chronic back pain


You're supposed to use the entire body but predominantly utilise the legs


Even in squat position, your back muscles are activated and your spine bends, dont worry


Then you got more important stuff to take care of than lifting a weight off the ground


I don't know why you are marked as controversial, this video is stupid. They should be teaching people how to brace correctly and sending them to the fucking gym if they want to avoid injuries, instead of scaring them with ridiculous models like the one in the video.


Even with muscles you're still not supposed to lift like that.


The point is that you're putting unnecessary strain on the back muscles


Back muscles help, but there are proper mechanics to lifting such as what is shown in the video above.  Lifting improperly will cause back pain or repetitive strain after done enough times. 

I am a physical therapy student at a workman’s comp clinic and teach proper lifting to patients multiple times a day.


The glutes are the largest muscle iirc


Hello Mr chiro, how's business


That this video is dumb as shit fear mongering and completely outdated misinformation.


Your proportions change as you grow, plus we just stop doing it and lose the habit. You can go to countries who still use squatting toilets and people there can squat down a lot better because they never stop practicing it.


You don't know why? Toddlers are closer to the ground. They don't need to bend. If I was 30" small I'd squat for everything too. Plus a 1 year old's bones and muscles haven't fully formed and developed yet that's why their joints are squishy and flexible.


I know a lot of people are downvoting you but I completely agree with you. I’m a physio working accoring to what the evidence says. Now I’m not perfect (obviously) but I do know there isn’t any evidence supporting the claims in this video.

Our backs being fragile is one of those things that have been engrained in everyone mind just like “your knees can’t go over your toes when squatting” even though that makes no sense. Walk down the stairs and see how far your knees go over your toes.

Our backs are strong and resilient. Our discs aren’t just jelly donuts waiting to pop. They’re more like car tires filled with bubblegum that was chewed and became really hard. Yes weird way to describe it but hopefully this gives you an idea. We also have A LOT of muscles supporting our spine, organs etc. Obviously you can’t just go ahead and lift 100kg if you’ve never lifted anything close to that. But that doesn’t mean it’s the lifting that’s a problem. It’s the fact that you lifted too much too soon. Just like you’re not gonna run a marathon if you haven’t even run 5km before. You have to build up tolerance gradually. A lot of times when we hurt our backs it’s muscle-related rather than spine-related.

Even if you hurt your back lifting something light (at home or otherwise) and think “must’ve been my technique” make sure you take into account all the other factors: how was your sleep the past week? What about stress (work, social etc)? Did you overexert yourself etc? These factors play such a big role in why we get injuries, more than we realize.

Don’t fear moving your spine, it’s made to flex, extend and rotate.


Thank you for a last a good take on the matter ! And downvoted to hell... Indeed, no difference in back injuries between the 2 postures. On the other hand, teaching to patients these outdated informations has a huge nocebo effect on them.


There's no issue picking up a light object with your back. It's just that if it is heavy your spine can't handle the force with a back lift.


Sure it's not your ankle mobility?


I'm gonna point you in the direction of ido portal and the movement culture he's been spearheading, the guy's an egotistical ass but he does make good points. What I find most interesting from him that is everyone is born with the ability to squat and many lose it with age because of our lifestyles, squatting has historically been a basic resting position for humans before chairs were invented. He reckons everyone should have the ability to squat and practise the squat daily. I agree with him that everyone should practise the squat because bending over to pick something up is a very common occurrence that is troublesome for many

Tldr: practise squatting


You're wrong because you can't make the difference between lumbar and thoracic spine, and between a straight line and a curve.

Weight should always be lifted in such a way that the torso is as as upright as possible without going too extreme on knee flexion (generally staying less than 90 degrees flexion), therefore decreasing the moment arm on the back/spinal erectors, and transferring load to legs and glutes, which are more powerful muscles than back. To do this, just like in the demonstration, the weight is lifted from a position as close to the hips as possible (in a back/forward plane).


Learn how to lift and that won't happen anymore

I too, fall over if I lean forward

You just solved a question I’ve had for years now. 

I watch my 4 year old son and he’s always deep squatted when playing. Was trying to figure out how come as an adult I’d be crippled doing that all day. 

Quick google says the knees start turning from cartilage to bone between 2 and 6 and almost 12 before fully turned into bone.


It’s you stop doing it and your body loses the flexibility I’m 30 years old 6 feet and can squat all the way down with my ass touching the ground as both my feet are planted on the floor

I can stay in that position for what feels like forever it doesn’t feel strainful or anything it feels comfortable and you kinda use your body weight to self balance and it becomes effortless and comfortable


It's probably more disuse. I found that by squatting super deep as well as sitting in a baby style/slav squat for a few minutes a few times a day it's a lot easier to do.


As others have said, it's disuse; use it or lose it. In our defense though, their center of gravity is much easier to work with with such stubby limbs and short body.

Pfft maybe YOUR knees do, mine certainly don't


There is no inherent incorrect posture for a back, you know nothing


Tennis balls are not heavy enough to hurt your back, you can pick those up with straight legs, might be better overall honestly


Bruss not sure what you do but im 43 and been in construction for 20+ years.

Everything hurts :)


What an unnecessary mean thing to say


You must be very short.


Weightlifting shoes have a heel specifically to help with squatting


You're just wrong.  I mean, if we're talking 4 inch stilettos, yeah, that shit isn't ideal for picking up heavy loads, but some heel, like what a boot may have, as opposed to flat, will actually put you in a better position to squat a load up.

Especially for people with deficient mobility, like the sorts who lose flexibility due to your oddly placed crusade against western style toilets, the heel helps position the knee more forward than one could otherwise get with limited ankle mobility.

This in turn lets you utilize more glutes for lifting the item.


What are you talking about?


yeah our bodies are able to safely do both, ofc lifting with your back puts a lot more strain because the physics of the lift and the positioning of your back if off your center of mass. You need a lot more back, core and hamstring strength to do this lifting safely, where lifting with your legs requires more leg strength, and a bit of back and bicep.


Have you seen people deadlift in the gym.  The world record is 500kg.  You can definitely lift heavy stuff without having your spine vertical.


This is an outdated and destructive view to give as a PT. People can be competent and strong lifting in a range of positions, it all comes down to load.


I mean that sounds like fear inducing advice. Additionally ‘throw’ out your back? 

I also work at my physiotherapy clinic. 

You should look at work by - Adam Meakins. 

Destigmatising lifting will probably be more empowering for your clients than getting them to live in this thought of ever impending doom. 

Hence the ineffectiveness of manual handling training of the times - every work place gets it but injuries have sky rocketed. 

Lifting load is more important than form, and generally living a healthier lifestyle will change a lot!


But if the „deadlift“ form is bad, wouldn’t most stop doing it?  I feel pretty comfy lifting like ( if I don’t fuck up my form)


No it won’t.   It’s called using your muscles.


They must be pretty shit at moving and lifting to "throw out their back" from hinging at the hips


to be fair, the weight on SLD is close to the legs so its easier to straigthen the back, whereas with the bad posture move, the weight is away from the legs.


This


Well thats the crux of the issue, its not that you can't lift without your legs, its just that we aren't good at doing it with heavy weight or for extended time, you can strengthen your core and hamstrings so you are safer from injury.


Progressive loading is the correct answer. If you never lift like the second way, your back will never be exposed to the movement. Essentially making the muscles weak for that movement. 

To truly protect your back, progressive, graded, loading into the positions is ideal


It's somewhere between the two options demonstrated. Your back shouldn't be taking the full force, but shifting all the force to your knees isn't good on the knees either.


I guess we'll just know


You need adam meakins in your life


Mhm I don't think so personally I think knee pain is even worse. I've got pretty bad back pain due to um massive heavy honkers lol but knee pain is a whole ither thing. Foot pain too that's awful


The point is you don't lift like that when you have core muscles. There's a reason deadlift max weights are higher than squatting.


What about it is "unnecessary" and what about it is "strain"?

They're muscles. It's what they're here for.

The fact that you're incompetent at moving and lifting does not mean that back muscles somehow must never be used, it only means that you're incompetent at moving and lifting. 

You are fragile and weak because *you* are fragile and weak, not because of a universal law of human biomechanics which states that it's impossible to hinge at the hips safely.


Says who? That's what muscles are for.


Wrong.


You've not seen my glutes


I think OP was sarcastic (hopefully)


I probably got my biases but ive had plenty more issues with my back than my knees. Ill gladly use my legs/knees to lift something instead of my back. I have no idea about this stuff but it feels more like im using my leg muscles than damaging the knees.


Thank you Professor ♥︎


Yeah, not really.
 https://www.painscience.com/articles/lifting-technique-is-not-important-for-your-back.php


Nope, not sure. It's not likely I'll ever find out but my hips are a mess when I was a kid they would go out of their sockets all the time


Become slav, learn to squat.


Yeah im used to that weight..I just got lazy and picked it wrong way.


But what about when you lent over?


Toddlers are always used as examples of “how to pick something up properly” in Manual Handling training videos. Anything they perceive as heavily they naturally squat over the item, bend their knees and keep their backs straight, just don’t run and trip over your building blocks when carrying said item.


Why you gotta call em that man? Have some empathy god damn


Humans should still be able to deep squat long into adulthood. Not being able to is from lack of use/movement


Im asian. We squat all the time. I can basically sit indefinitely just squatting on my feet.


I have EDS so I have funky joints and it's such a comfortable position for me to sit in


Ima grown man and I can squat and have my ass touch the ground. I was born in Europe and shit in a hole for 8 years before moving to America. That skill is forever imprinted on my knees development. I can go from standing to squating with my ass touching the floor and two feet on the floor like nothing. 

In hs that Russian cross arm knee up stereotypical dance shit I would do like a pro at parties and we would all laugh cause we were high and stupid


I also found out not long ago that if your able to squat all the way down that’s a sign of good skeletal and muscular health and fitness and if you can’t it’s a sign of poor physical health and a non active lifestyle .


Hello komrade! How is our wife doing?


I also choose this guy's wife.


There are illustrations : )


Woops you re right


Surrender to the inevitable passage of time


Now your mind gets screwed and you fall into a coma


This.

I work for a big company and was lifting heavy crates day in day out, now I have chronic pain from the spine all the way down both legs to my feet. And now I can't even claim anything because it was mild at first so I didn't even report it.

My advice to anyone in a physical job would be to go as slow as possible (especially in a shitty job where everybody gets paid the same per hour), ask for help where you may need it, and report anything into the accident book, even near misses. It is truly not worth it, as it completely changed my life and I can tell you that only you can look out for yourself, unfortunately most people won't care for you if you work your ass off and as soon as you are down and out you will be replaced, speaking from my own experience. It is truly sad and fucked up.


Under sufficient loading ranges, there is a limited range of motion for correct form with back exercises.

You will absolutely hurt yourself if you're fatigued from lifting heavy weight with poor form.


You pick up tennis balls by trapping it between the racket and your foot and flipping it into the air, I thought everyone knew this!


Nah I'm just not weak


he shits in the streets


Weirdly conflating losing the ability to Slav squat with using toilet pedestals


Ding ding ding!!


You should expose your body to progressive overload to help it get stronger, more ably face every day life, and mitigate the physical deterioration of aging

No such thing as a golden position to lift with. Some angles allows you to lift more, some less. But if you manage load capacity you’ll probably suffer fewer and less harmful injuries than otherwise


You are using your legs, not your knees.


I think the reason for that would be range of motion


Not sure if you are unaware of this (some just aren’t) but while your meaning is correct you sound like a dick. Your point is going to be lost because of it.


-hank hill


While I do think that's an interesting read, I am gonna say I really doubt its conclusions for one major reason.

Your legs are simply stronger than your back.

If you are lifting large loads, it's good to have your literal largest muscles aiding you in the lift. 

I frequently had to lift 200+ pounds for my job. If I tried to lift that without using my legs, I would have probably been severely injured and injured a patient. 

Would you say that you are not more likely to get injured using your wrist to lift a heavy object than your bicep?

Not only that, but using your legs in a controlled manner means you are less likely to lose balance picking something up.

> and we don’t need to be taught how to lift simple heavy objects “properly.”

This is where I think whoever wrote this is insane. I've been injured by someone who ignored their training during a left, multiple times.

And he compares back lifting to a deadlift, but in no way should your back be bowed out during a deadlift.

When I lived in Nepal there were times where I pretty much had to. I accepted it and pushed myself to get used to it, even though I'm a really big guy. (The bigger you are, the more stress it is on your knees) 

I'm grateful I did. Squatting is often the most ergonomic way to do something close to the ground, and as an avid outdoorsman, it's awesome for fires and outdoor pooping. 

People are often impressed to see a 6'1 255 lb guy deep squatting to do something. I always give cred to my Asian homies.


Damn. Yah I can do it, just not hang out for 20 minutes. Knees will be tender after a long time.


Still recovering from hip surgery.


I also choose this comrades wife


Hello cumrade! Her back is blown out but she is doing fine.


Only if you skip brain day


There is no limited range of motion, only depends on what you want to train. 

If you're fatigued you can get hurt doing anything heavy, regardless of form.

 Load management causes injuries, not form.


That's apparent, takes a lot of effort to work out a dumbass as much yours.


Your knees are part of your legs believe it or not


It's because deadlifting uses more muscle groups than squatting, thus you are able to lift more weight.


I understood his point perfectly.


> I frequently had to lift 200+ pounds for my job. If I tried to lift that without using my legs, I would have probably been severely injured and injured a patient. 

This is because you don't know how to lift. I frequently lift that too without "using my legs" as you say (you still use your legs actually but whatever) and I have never injured my back or legs in any way.


Yeah,  fast is always too long for Lent.


Height-deficient


Through endless conversations and a lot of hard work that you didn't contribute to, a general consensus was reached that "little person" is the best way to reference anyone of unusually short stature

That sounds patronising af


Bro who decided that. It sounds like you’re talking about a kid


Nah, its dwarf.


I have a midget friend and they would fucking pounce at you if you called them a little person. As the other person said, it sounds patronizing as fuck


Quit *Stalin* and man up and sex her up comrade.


Lower leveled.


Yh it sounds like you’re talking about a child


Well, Midget sounds pejorative to those who recognize that the etymology of the term lies largely with usage of circus and vaudeville acts.
I believe that little person is the accepted modern term but there aren't a lot of situations we should feel the need to classify people in this way unless speaking medically where you would more likely call them a Person with Dwarfism.


It will be in a few more years. That’s how it works. People are called the accepted vernacular. They get salty about it. They demand a change. It’s changed. They get salty about being called that. On and on forever.


Cock eyed


While that's certainly true, little person has always sounded patronizing. The first thing that comes to my mind when i hear little person is toddler.


That's how I feel about the term "skin of color" to describe non-whites. However, using the term "colored" used to be common until it was declared offensive. I feel like SOC is just a repackaged (and accepted) way to again say someone is colored.


You... really think it works like that?

Idiot and moron were once medical terms. They were being used as a prejorative, so they were changed. We got the r-word as medical term, which is now so bad we can't even really say what the word is. Do you think it was the mentally handicapped that were "salty" about the r-word?

Oh yeah, I agree, which is no surprise it’ll become a slur again sooner rather than later

I have never seen anyone complain about people not listening to songs sung by women. Do people actualy wory about the music we listen to?


Literally anything by Myth & Roid


Renai Circulation is the best anime intro of all time hands down. It has never been outclassed since and never will. It is an epic mix of groovy jazz and rap and all good elements of any anime song. It is by far the best.


Voracity go brrr


I'm here to answer for over half of the Love Live! fanbase who are, in fact, male


Come on and slam and welcome to the jam!


I prefer female vocals most of the time.


One of the Best opening ever


More than half the songs I have on my phone are sung by women. 2/3s of the remaining songs have both men and women in them. The rest is either men or no vocals.


Nanahira is pretty cool


Remember men, Se ~ No to thots and crappy SJWs

My favorite female led song is probably be Myth and Roid's L.L.L from overlord. The second being Swinging by Murasama from The Tower of Druaga. And third being Kuusou Mesorogiwi by the band Yōsei Teikoku from Future Dairy.


Macross: Everything but Fire Bomber and (technically) some Delta is female singers.  
Gundam: Gender equality (where there's vocals).   
LoGH: Need I go on? 

All these "angry male" shows have "female" music. Hm.


Idk why this is even a thing. Every guy I know is gah-gah over female singers.


Short story, went to visit the folks and my niece was there (5 years old). She was on her tablet listening to this song. I checked her history in fear of what i might find. Well what i found was something i didn't want to tell my sis or my folks. My niece is a weeb.

I had to inform them in the most responsible way i can think of, so i connected her tablet to the Chromecast and played the song on full blast. My niece was amused, my sis angry, and my parents confused.

I bet this girl gets offended when a male rapper uses a female term and she takes it the wrong way lol


Fuwa fuwa wa!


What's that? I can't hear you over **platinum disco** and **Again**

Get rekt you thots


It’s not that men won’t sing songs by women, it’s that they just want to sing good songs by women. I am guilty of singing the opening to Steel Angel Kurumi and the end credits song Mask for Bakuretsu Hunters too much.


wait, some people actually think that? I'm pretty sure most men prefer female vocals.


It isn't our fault that most music sung by women is trash. It also happens that most music sung by men is trash.

Most music is trash

hey looks like iv'e seen this, i mean in other social media platform


My favorite bands may be male singers but I sure as hell liked the live cut my lip sung by both its writer and a female lead singer from another band touring with them. That was a beautiful pair and I’d love it if I could hear the version with only her voice in it.


"...they never like songs sung by women"  
Me listening to *Girls Talk* on repeat for 2 days: **sure...**


More than half the songs i listen to are sung by women

To be honest I like a lot of songs sung by girls. Especially when they are Japanese... especially when they are anime openings

Eir Aoi is easily in my top 3 favorite artists of all time, sitting pretty at #2. I listen to her music almost daily, with some of my favorites being Singularity, Lament, Jump, Sirius, and Innocence. #1 spot goes to Hiroyuki Sawano (and by a long shot), whose music sometimes features female singers, such as "Nexus" from Promare, "Uncontrollable" from Xenoblade Chronicles X, and "Blumenkranz" and "Before my Body is Dry" from Kill La Kill.

32 out of the 81 songs on my anime playlist are sung by women, and I typically enjoy those songs more on average


Hm. 70% of popular Japanese songs?


Wait what guys are supposed to listen to songs sung by males?


I'll be honest, I'm a metalhead and metal songs when are sung by girls are way better imo


Bitch what? I listen to the violet evergarden opening on almost a daily basis

Jokes on you, my phone is 99% filled with songs in girls voice (i have over 900)


Do girls really think that way,????


I'm not quite sure if anyone would connect the "ideals of masculinity" to weebs though


I used to not like feminine voices but then I realised I didn't like white women voices because they are in a high pitch, meanwhile black women have that little bass voices that I fancy


Well tbf most of the songs sung by women nowadays aren't necessarily targeted at the male demographic

Never like songs sung by **real** women*

Checkmate, men.

Edit: Jfc guys it was a joke. Guess I can’t leave /s off of any comment anymore.


Kokoro wa shinka suru yo Motto motto


There's 2 versions the nornal one and the meme one


Please no one tell to this guy about twitter


I can bet you hard, throbbing cash that no matter what you do in life someone is gonna have a problem with it.


Sometimes a new popular song sung by a woman comes out, and some people say they don't like the song.

So, some people that do like the song complain that the men that dislike the song and say that those men are misogynist and clame that those men don't like the song because it's sung by a woman. Most of the time the people that complain are SJW or feminist.

It's like when that Ghostbusters movie came out and everyone hated it. Then the people that worked on the film say the reason people hated it, was because the main cast were women.


This meme got reposted on IG, and I saw a lot of people saying "women can't make good music" unironically in the comments. Seriously people are weird as hell.


I've heard this take back in the 60's where radios would limit how many female singers can play in a row. 

But yea, this is literally a boomer argument.


Some years ago Spotify had this thing were if your library had too many male artists, it would recommend you female artists to "balance it". I'm not sure about the details since I don't use Spotify and it was limited time thing for International Women's Day.


Well you would if Kpop fanatics in your school beats you up for liking JP music

Even if said music is absolutely not related to anime


I was surprised to find out they've done the music for a good number of my favorite anime, and a several more that I enjoyed. They're definitely S-Tier music


Crazy Scary Holy Fantasy!


Hydra is not only one of the best endings, it´s one of my favorite songs ever, shit´s fucking beautiful both in visuals and music


I have to disagree. Hacking to the gate is the best OP ever in my opinion.


[deleted]


The best is Flyers from Death Parade. If you disagree we'll meet at a bar and talk about it.


I kinda like Delusion Express better.


No, everybody’s circulation is better


Colors by FLOW would like have a word with you


Bloody Stream: *Am I a joke to you?*


Bloody Stream,Cruel Angel's Thesis,Brave Shine,Unravel,Great Days,Traitor's Requiem,Fantastic Dreamers,This Game,Sono Chi No Sadame,Etc.:Are you sure about that?


Wrong.  You can never beat Cruel Angel's Thesis for GOAT anime intro.


A man of culture indeed


Sorry, it's not even the best monogatari op.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmWnFTkLmlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmWnFTkLmlI)


False, it's seems that you've never heard of "GO! GO! MANIAC"


> It has never been outclassed since

It was outclassed by its own sequel, Mousou Express.


I'm sorry but sasageyo takes the crown for me


My favorite opening of all time is from "Gunslinger Girl: Teatrino".  
I never found opening like this again : /


In my opinion Re:re from erased is the best op by far


For me, Spice and Wolf's OP is pretty good visual wise, but it really cannot beat Renai Circulation.


Never got the hype for this op. Like I'm not gonna call it bad or anything, but I feel like I've seen so many that do their jobs so much better.


lmao, it is not even the best song for her character


My favorite anime OP doesn't sound like an anime OP at all (Monster's OP).


Yeah this guys never listened to platinum disco


It's awesome but I JJBA DIU's great days will always have my heart 
And crazy noisy bizarre town ofc


Idk Staple Stable is pretty good and so is Centimeter


I like the NHK opening more


Well it is the best as an op, but best songthat is an op is kogarashi sentiment.


ikimono gakari


It’s good, but I don’t think it’s the best.

I don’t think there is a definitively best song from an anime. There are tons of good ones, average ones and some that are bad.

There are shows where every Op is amazing, for example JoJo and Overlord

Also artists where pretty much every song is a banger: Myth & Roid


From just the music I would say that platinum disco and mousou express are both better, and I think there’s a lot of other amazing OPs from other shows too.


My favorite will always be the Angel Beats opening


Eh, it's not even the best Monogatari intro IMO. Platinum Disco is where it's at. So much so that Koyomi himself does the dance in one episode.


No


Voracity, Hydra, L.L.L...


i am very very crazy very


Let's be honest. Way more than half.


snow halation but shawtys like a melody


Katakuri song LMAO


Same. I always think it's natural, I'm a dude, *of course* I prefer to listen to females.


For songs with no vocals I recommend Polyphia


I really love Nanahira. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love her so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of listening that sweet, angelic voice of hers. It is my life goal to meet up her with her in real life and just say hello to her. 

I fall asleep at night dreaming of her holding a personal concert for me, and then she would be sorry tired that she comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold her hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would lightly nibble on her ear just to hear what kind of sweet moans she would let out. Then, I would hug her while she clings to my body hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as she moans louder and louder. 

I would give up almost anything just for her to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of her. When I wake up, she is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on her. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can listen to her beautiful voice. When I go to sleep, I dream of her and I living a happy life together. She is my pride, passion, and joy. If she were to call me "Onii-chan," I would probably get diabetes from her sweetness and die. 

I wish for nothing but her happiness. If it were for her, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without her, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Nanahira.

She deserves more popularity


But do you also slam?


Just say you like to peg guys and move on


It's so much easier than bitching on Twitter


[deleted]


Personally I don't have a preference. Both are good. But I primarily listen to metal, and female vocalists are under represented in the metal world.


*procedes to sing Japanese with Swabian combined with north German accent*


exactly. . .   they dont want you to listen to "female singers".

They are mad because we dont listen to Cardi B or Nicki Minaj 

LMAO   fuck that noise


thank you for this


I didn't find any posts that meet the matching requirements for r/goodanimemes. 

It might be OC, it might not. Things such as JPEG artifacts and cropping may impact the results.

Renai Circulation from Bakemonogatari.


You’d be surprised at how many misandrists there are that disguise themselves under the feminist movement


is this a serious question ?

Of fucking course no. . .    only braindead idiots in Twitter think this way. The same braindead idiots who think all men are "closet rapists" and women have less privileges than men


we watch JoJo. . .   so YES


It's not complete. Not cool.


But... Real women DO sing those songs originally and then they appear in the anime

DOUBLE checkmate women

COME ON AND SLAM AND WELCOME TO THE JAM


Twitter: the place where you are angry about everything; Sometimes even be angry of being angry


No *normal person* complains about things like these.


This is the first I’ve heard of it too lol. I didn’t know that was a thing


I mean, search twitter long enough and you'll find randos and trolls who are mad about literally every topic.

But is the sentiment expressed in the meme a common one? No.


Twitter is the worst social media platform EVER.


Or Tumblr


I will find the cure for cancer. 
A ha p


Dont quote me on this but i belive they did the same with black artists.


I was listening to the Re Zero second OP and thought wow this sounds kinda like myth and roid, then checked the artist and oh shit it is them. 10/10 tho will download all of their songs on OSU


Other things to check out of you like them:

Kisida Kyodan & The Akebosi Rockets

Ling Tosite Sigure


I couldn’t agree more


El Psy Kongroo


This guys got the right idea.


Completely agree, Steins;Gate 0’s OP is also amazing and the soundtrack “Skyclad Observer” is amazing too.


They're both pretty damn great honestly. I can't decide lol.


No Sasageyo is the best OP , the anthem of weebs


The ED is even harder hitting imo


Damn son I was also going to disagree and say that “Crying For Rain” by Minami was hands down the best but Hacking to the Gate is also stupid good. I still stand by mine however I still agree with you


Nah Mate, Log Horizon takes the cake


IDK if abby of them would be my number 1, but Black Clover has consistently had absolute bangers for OPs since the beginning (but really ramping up starting with Black Rover)


Tuturu~


Araragi doing the platinum disco dance while talking to his sister is just as great as the song itself.


Yep platinum disco is number 1


False, Mya-nee is number 1.


perfect slumbers, mousou express, kogarashi sentimen?

All monogatari ops best op


Haha, it's such a bait song too.


I see you are a man of culture


I disagree.


The best certainly is Virtue and Vice. Guess you need to come to my death metal bar for a little talk


I mean, Paranoia Agent is a thing

Also if you liked the Opening for DP check out Beastars


Mousou gane~

#JIBUN WO


All Jojo OP's slap on another level. And that's a fact.


I would agree with this but you didn't put crazy noisy bizarre town in there :(


Fr, it’s an absolute bop both as a song and as an op

Then there’s the piano version that makes me cry every time I hear it


For me I think the best is naruto Shippuden ed 33, Dr stone ed 2, deca dence ed 1, kaguya Sama ed 2, didn't I say to make my abilities average op 1 and naruto op 2


I prefer Guren no Yumiya


L.L.L. all the way


Happy Cake Day!


Exactly


If I were to pick, I'd probably land on a 3 girls 2 guys out of my top 5 singers. 

For the Curious:

Jorn Lande, Tommy Karevik, Alissa White-Gluz, Lzzy Hale, Floor Jansen. No particular order.


The term fragile masculinity doesn't mean what you think it means.

Some men feel so much pressure to prove their masculinity that it makes them fragile. It doesn't mean that masculinity itself is fragile.


Same. If it sounds good I listen to it. I dont care about sex, nationality or race.

Ok can some one tell me where the come on and slam cam from


 kotoba o keseba ii ya tte


I miss the days when the internet was more about posting info and fun stuff. Nowadays, if you aren't angry, something's wrong with you


You say that like reddit is different


Can't have ~~shit in Detroit~~ common sense on Twitter


Exactly why twitter icon is an annoying chirping bird


Why did it take you this long? Why isn't it simpler/less costly? You're taking jobs away from hardworking doctors! I DON'T WANT NO MAJCRO CHIPS.


"Cancer is good because there's too much people in the world already. More ways to kill them off is desired."- someone on Twitter, probably.


Oh, in US definitely.


oh yeah, like the hundreds of Jazz groups werent a thing

LMAO  we trying to re-write history now?


I've heard of Ling Tosite Sigure before. They did some stuff for Psycho-Pass (one of my top 3 favs) and Tokyo Ghoul. I havent heard of the other two, though, so I'll check them out. Thanks for the recommendation buddy


But I’m pretty sure the opening to evangelion is the absolute best


God damn, that was life changing. So glad I searched up the song on YouTube after reading this. Thank you.


SAUCE?


That's so wrong, he is supposed to stand completely still in contemplation of humanity's impending destruction, and to sometimes open his mouth or something


No, we are number 1.


Death: the show  
Parade: the OP


Was. Now I am just a man sitting at the bar, waiting for this mothefucker, so I can teach him some culture.


We'll see each other at the bar. In like... 80 years. After a long fulfilling life. We have shit to talk about.


Bousou suru


I’d love to give Albedo all of my love and passion ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


Yes

But ANY thing is seen as "trying to prove there masculinity". There's definitely people that applies to but it's to overused

why are you talking as if the entire world was America ?

It pisses me off so much when people think that the dumb shit that is the American internet ecosystem , applies to everybody else. You guys don't even make 5% of all world's population. . .

The internet 

is still all about posting your info and fun stuff. People still enjoy incredibly dark humour. We all still happy and chilling. You just try to get out of the usa circle to see.


After being on both for like 2 years, I can safely say Reddit is muuuuch better than Twitter. Still not great but way better


Dam


> I don't want no Bill Gates government tracking chips

- via Twitter for government spy device which is always on your person


No one is saying black artists didn't exist. But there was quite a big racial divide when it came to radio. It started to decline in the 50s and then pretty much vanished when Motown became popular in the 60s. But stations geared towards white people were not really playing black music for some time.


You might be familiar with them actually: Kisida Kyodan & The Akebosi Rockets did the GATE OPs.


Do you mean ”Cruel Angel Thesis” or “Fly Me to The Moon” or another from Evangelion?


I will yell from the roof tops that Minami is one of the best vocalists out there. Glad you enjoyed it!


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BSpcLWwU9O0. I believe it's from Tsukimonogatari?


Let’s not start a waifu war now, alright? :D


It applies to more men than you think.

Walter White and Hank from Breaking Bad are excellent examples. And if we're talking anime, this season's Rent-A-Girlfriend.


Iiiiinnnn West Philadelphia born and raised


It’s like I never left


Its hard not to hear the spacejam version instead of the normal


dakedo are nanka chigau kamo


I agree, but for people from small countries the size of their "internet community" is just too small.. so they have (like me) to use reddit or twitter to share memes, thoughts etc..
And most of the americans on twitter are just so different.


It's the EU and Canada too.


Portuguese internet ecosystem is worst.The top 5 youtuber are "dead" (1st is one guy who bought lots of subs in the past and posts sometimes (1 a month) a pokemon go video, 2nd is those guys who shows some """"dangerous""" things like lasers, 3rd a reaction channel that don't post since last year, 4th is an okay kid channel, 5th is a fucking youtuber that completely left youtube 2 years ago).

We had a bigger drama with the "Casa dos Youtubers" (Youtuber's House) with a lot of youtubers playing pranks to others, youtubers wanting to leave the house, youtubers making groups to kick others of the house, youtubers leaving the house and go to another houses, youtubers measuring dicks to see who rent the coolest car.

And the thing I hate most. People think Portugal is equal to USA. In Portugal, we almost have no racism. I think the only ethnicity who portuguese has some problems are gypsies (you almost can't find a coffee shop without a porcelain frog peeking somewhere so that gypsies do not enter).  


Also it's hard to find places in portuguese, even worse in portugal's portuguese


Tis' the truth.


I guess it depends on the subreddit.


Meanwhile r/animemes mods, r/traa and every circlejerk sub agree with you


Twitter changes people. I thought it would be a good place to keep updated on different creators and voice actors. God fucking damn was i wrong...


point taken.

It just activates my bullshit detector, when people start talking about "this minority was not allowed to x" for the sake of a woke argument


That's one I never actually watched, and I don't think I ever saw the openings.


dont hate me but I'm kind of a weeblet? so I gotta say my favorite anime intro is great days


obviously cruel angel's thesis


Or fighting gold?


I'm convinced. She even gives Robert Weber from Squid the Whale and Emarosa a run for his money. [Blue](https://youtu.be/tBtenlHt2sA) and [Stranger](https://youtu.be/6i7A6PVv9PA) are some awesome examples.


Thanks.


Yeah but she’s the only one shown in the outro


On a playground where i spent most of my days


Wait there are different versions?


sennin no michi no ippo kara


I wouldn't mind, if the twitter shit stayed on twitter. But now there are political twitter screenshots everywhere, even on the frontpage of imgur. I go there to have fun, dangit!


Absolutely depends on the sub.


It really depends on the subreddit, but at least here there isn’t a hoard of people looking for cancels, cult followings, the pure hatred for other people’s sense of humor, taste in games/movies/books, or kinks.

Or at least there is significantly less here


r/syriancirclejerkwar disagrees


So true, I went there for the same thing, to follow some devs and content creators. My god I think I almost went insane seeing so much hate and negativity


Yea, great days is, well, great


Cool


Wdym, i was asking which song from Evangalion


Without clicking it Blue does sound familiar. I’ll check this out thank you


Ooh, hadn't heard of either of these artists. Gonna have to get more of that tomorrow.


Fair point


Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool


Might not be for long. Guy was about to get hit by ban hammer. So if you wanna listen, now's a good time.


ishi no you ni katai sonna ishi de


Agreed have you ever been on that womens dating subreddit? It's so full of horse shit I swear, as a guy into BDSM the shit they pull is one of, if not the greatest bs that I have ever read. Like 'oh if your man doesn't want to be pegged he's a patriarchal bastard peg him until he likes it'; no if your partner doesn't want to be pegged don't fucking peg them


Yea on Twitter there is much more open hatred.

Alone on the kink side, i get insulted on Twitter almost daily....


Meanwhile, there is Tumblr where people create threads about sending a mangaka death threats because their favourite gay ship didn't become canon. Yes, that happened.


Well, perhaps the key word is *relatively.* Reddit has its awful corners, but ignoring those is not too difficult.

As a side note, I'm kind of confused that Reddit seems to have an infamous reputation outside.


Thats literally a anti turkey sub and as a greek i love it lol (pls don't be racist towards other civilians of other countries, fuck Erdogan tho)


Komm susser Todd


And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school


Can I get some context please? I thought it was just a Space Jam song to begin with and have no idea what to look up here.


 chiri mo tsumoreba yamato nadeshiko


Which one is it? Isn’t it something along the lines of Women’sdatingadvice? I remember going on a sub like that and only seeing posts about how all men are terrible


I don’t doubt you, shipping communities can be a little.... extreme


Kinda hard to ignore those subs when they manage to ban ALL of ur favorite subs *cough* AHS *cough*

[Just watch this pls ](https://youtu.be/yUV9TyfYaEQ)


r/SmegmaLovers


yeah i love it too, it actually very funny


When a couple of guys who were up to no good


Wrong guy. My bad. Double checked.


shiinuki de iya shi nuki de


Pretty sure that's it. It's just a terrible subreddit


AHS's practices are fucking abhorrent. It makes my blood boil. Easily the most dangerous sub on Reddit right now. Anyone who doesn't conform to their extremely narrow world view gets branded a bigot. Any sub where open discussion is permitted is branded a hate sub. They cherry pick 'evidence' to fit their narrative, and even the most polite attempts to dispute their claims get you permabanned. If all that wasn't bad enough, they also have cooperation from Reddit's admins.  

This sub is already in their sights.


Why can't the reddit app open the YouTube app when clicking on a link, no, it opens the horrendous mobile page of YouTube


Disgusting


Not clicking the link chief. But yeah, point partially taken.


pov you play 1s


opponent: you wouldn't win without demos

me: yes


Getting meaningful demos without throwing away your rotation and leaving your team in a bad situation is definitely something I'd consider a skill


"If you didn't wanna get demo'd so much, why did you camp in your goalpost and let me demo???"


Honestly, I sometimes demolish opponents if they are goalkeeping too much.


The tutorial teach you how to jump, perhaps it is time to revisit it if you keep getting demoed.


Demos are not bad, I do not get why everyone gets freaked out about them.


Literally had a dude say "smh where's the respect in this game" after I scored my 3rd bump goal of the match.

Like, maybe consider not driving directly in front of the supersonic car next time. It didn't workast time, or the time before that. It won't work now.


I had a guy that I dumpstered jn 1s bitch at me for “fake challenging too much”, and this has the same energy lol


We would have won if they didn't keep scoring goals!


Depends. A well timed demo wreaks havoc. Or, sometimes a demo is pointless because without a shooter the demo does nothing.


I do love the “What a save” when you take a goal from someone you accidentally demo


D3 players explaining how they would be Champ if it weren't for gaping bootyholes


Reminds of people I've played against with usernames like "onlydemos" or some cringe shit like that and just demo the whole match on 2v2, maybe to piss people off? Idk. In the end it doesn't bother me cause we just beat their ass lol


Clean game until they start losing because their rotation is off, or the other team is better, automatically start trying to demo. It’s cheap, but effective.


"do you actually have fun playing like that?"

Me: "Hell yeah!"


Teams or parties with one dedicated demoer who can barely aerial and just races around chasing people down (with GC car control btw), when it isn't even strategically relevant or even smart, that's just bullshit. I hate those. Luckily those teams usually lose because it's a shit strategy, and they're usually toxic as well so it's satisfying to beat their ass.

Besides that, I tend to demo and bump a lot myself when it makes sense, which I've noticed is quite triggering to people. I get lots of people who start chasing me for the rest of the game.

Oops! Sorry!


#**N***OO*^^B ^B^U^M^P^E^R


Sorry but whats a demo in RL?


Mechanic = mechanic. 🤷🏻‍♂️


Well, demoing can be a strategy mostly in 2v1 situations BUT demoing instead of rotating and not getting punished cause the global level of the game is around diamond even in GC is getting me upset


...or people trying to explain that they would have won that 1v1 usually, but at the end of the day they lost the match. It's that simple. xd


Are there an equal amount of demo post complaints as there are defenses-for on here? 

I’m seeing these posts multiple times per week and then the echo chamber that follows. Do you all need to feel validated? “Mommy mommy I’m not a bad boy right? Tell me I’m not a bad boy!”


Demo's are a part of the game, I don't get why people whine so much...

Yes, odd occasion they can be annoying, - but just get revenge! it's part of the game fgs!!


Dudes whatasaving me after they get a couple goals, teammate starts demoing
They get salty, start insulting and lose LOL


Demos should be used by therapist all over the world to find weak minded people and their resilience and tolerance towards frustration lol


People get mad af when spawn demo the 3 or 4 times in a row its so funny


I mean in some scenarios. Like when I pass and rotate and my teammate demos in the corner next to an open net, and the ball just goes right by it.


imagine not being able to dodge lol


Just press x lmao


Don't like to get demoed? Dodge it then. Don't like to get scored on? Defend it then. Don't like to lose? Win it then. Simple.


Demos are completely fine, they are a mechanic that most people overlook trying to learn. There's one exception though, and that's heat seeker, I don't see how people have fun doing it in that mode.


I mostly play 2s and I don't think avoiding demos is hard if you keep moving or stay supersonic. While defending you can see the opponent coming at you miles away anyways.

Its a part of the game and great for both offence/defence. I don't actively go for it but if I see a chance then I'll go brrr and demo opponents lol


I think most people currently hate demos because *they don't fucking work like they're supposed to*


Demos are meta


Lmao. If you don’t like demos… go fuck yourself. Now report me for inappropriate language.


Guess I should demo more


There’s tactical demos then there’s scumbags that go round constantly demoing people soon as they’ve respawned- I’ll be the first to admit there’s been a few times I’ve taken out the keeper just for our shot to bounce over the line lol but it’s so annoying when people go round demoing more than actually playing.

But hey I get it it’s part of the game, it should NOT be removed, I just find it hella annoying wen I’ve been blown up 10+ times in a row or have to start jumping over opponents (which I suppose does get pretty funny actually)


I get you can't win, you only demo

And I get you only win at ones because of kick-offs. 

And so on. It's easy to demo when they take their time to hit the ball.


I'm an ssg fan. Thanks to them. That's my playstyle. And it's confusing when ppl use a chat after I blow em up.


"It's part of the game. Stop crying about it"


me winning in gc2 lobbies using only demos and passes lmao


I get a chubby every time I demo.


I hate demos. I just bump people instead of demoing. At least it still keeps them in the game. 90% of the time, I get demod for no reason. It is what it is ig


I wonder how many games I've won off of driving ahqead to demo the last man back while my friend dribbles it in at 0 seconds.


I love pissing people off with demos, it’s quite entertaining!


Getting mad at demos is like getting mad at the 3 point shot in basketball. Just because it changes the game in a way you don't like, doesn't mean it doesn't take skill or isn't a valid strategy. And if it truly does ruin the game, that's not on the players using it. You can't expect Steph Curry to stop shooting 3s just because you wanna see post-ups.


I'm fine with getting demo'd but if it's all you've been doing all game and there's only 1 minute left can you stop and let me play?


the problem with demos is that they are so fricking inconsistent. when someone can demo with zero speed or cant demo with full speed just send the other flying to the other side of the map or when you collide in an angle its so random who gets to be demod. and dont even get me started with demos on the wall or in the air.


It usually against people who just sit in the net, waiting to counter attack.  Without demos, that strategy would be really hard to beat for most levels.  It's just just about demos either.  I find a lot of players really don't like being bumbed and roughed up, but it's a great strategy.  When I'm playing with a less skilled partner, I usually want them to focus on the physical game while angling to receive passes.


demos are just another mechanic and you have to play them out well or else they could counterattack you when you lose focus to the ball
except 1v1 ofc


I actually respect demo players because it takes a huge amount of skill to be able to incorporate demos into your rotation. Big up to demo players.


Ooh heck yes... especially in Heatseeker. Player who just start demoing piss me off


I was requested to die of several diseases in this game because I demo'ed some dudes. Ah well


I’m sure it’s been said a million times in this thread but if people say anything like “all you can do is demo, it’s sad.” I always reply with “don’t leave yourself vulnerable then”


I had a salty opponent say I can only score after demos. I pointed out the pros air dribble demo all the time. The response " no they only bump". At that time I realized I must be speaking to a child or an idiot and to move on.


I've grown to appreciate Demos as I've ranked up. There is a skill to it. Its knowing when to do it, because there is a risk involved. Many(or most) are sporadic. Sometimes in a 3s or occasionally 2s an opponent will only go for Demos. But when I get demo'd and just the right opportune time right as I begin to make a save or right before I sink that golden egg my m8 crafted for me, I cant even get mad anymore. It's all respect. It's why I added "Nice Demo!" for opponents and teammates alike.


Haha demos at lower ranks are only annoying because you can usually score on the other team without them. But at the higher ranks, sometimes demos are necessary because the level of skill with good teammates usually means a solid defense which makes scoring a lot harder without roughing em up a bit. 3v3s in the champ ranks and higher is usually where it seems necessary sometimes.

1v1 demos feel really unnecessary to me, though, because it only takes a couple good hits to get around them and score usually. Whenever I demo in 1v1s it's usually on accident and I will redirect my shot to miss on purpose after I say Sorry haha. Unless whoever I am playing is being a real jackass then I don't care. I'll demo and score while spamming "What A Save!"

And when they get mad enough to say something in chat, I'll hit em with the "This is Rocket League!"


They are good and can turn the tide in some close games, but it just makes it boring. Like… who finds it fun just blowing people up and taking an open net for 3/4 of your goals? I would much rather try to get it around someone, as that makes me use my mind and think about the rest of the play more than just predicting where the car in front of me will be so I can take them out.


Imagine doing a demo on purpose. Lolololol


The delusional banter in these comments from bumping bozos trying to justify their idiotic approach to getting cheap wins in virtual car soccer LOL


It is easier to exploit a mechanic to squeak a win but did you REALLY win? I'm always surprised on how much people pride themselves on mediocrity.


Demoing is just a cheep tactic to make low rank players stronger. Edit:  Triggered babies.


They don’t


[deleted]


I wonder in a world without demos player pinches would exist


If someone is just trying to demo and you can't punish that, you deserve to lose


Woody entered the chat.


“You wouldn’t win without demos!” Well, you wouldn’t win without the ball but it’s a part of the game isn’t it?


Am I the only one who uses nice bump or nice demo when my opponent demoes me? (of course not if they are toxic)


Whenever someone starts to demo a lot I just play more irradically


Can someone explain „demos“ ?


I mean, if all you do is run at me in net, and I get out the way... Your teammate is on their own and they just passed you the ball bit you're behind me.  So now I have a breakaway to your net.


u/savevideo


I gotta be honest here, demos get under my skin because I suck at them. I get a decent one here and there, but not consistently enough to really change the course of the game.


Literally everyone in Heatseeker


I only play this game casually, what's a demo?


No red cards in Rocket League.


I never really mind demos, but god damn it I hate them in heatseaker lmao. I just wanna make the ball go super fast and practice my saves please


u/savevideo


Reminds me of that scene from game of thrones after Bronn throws that guy from the moon door:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF0wa0W13yw


I literally ugly laughed at this and I’m not ashamed because it’s so true. People get so unnecessarily mad at demos even though they are a part of the game.


Which Movie/Series is this from?


My only issue with demos is when teammates just go for demos and expect you to score everything yourself.

No, demoing people isn’t helping when you aren’t actually helping move the ball into their net.


Me: (wins game)

Player 2: you're nothing without demos.

Me: you're also nothing without them.


Ok all opinions aside, what is with people immediately trying to demo all the time in a 2v3? Like I’m already down a guy why do you instantly have to play like a jerk


Listen demos are cool alright. But if I don’t have the ball and I’m not doing anything significant don’t fucking blow me up for the hell of it🤙


What is a demo


13k and counting!


I mean, demos are a part of the game. But it's an extremely cheap and boring way to play it, imo.

There's a reason it's banned in all (?) non-US sports, but for some reason the US loves random interferences in sports when everyone else hates it.


I can’t see the word demo without thinking of the demoman


Literally all I do is demo and not bother trying to get the ball lmao, this game is so easy


Demos take no skill until you rage and try to do it back to them. Near impossible.


If you didn't want to lose to demos don't get demoed


Avoiding demos is just as much a defensive skill as is backboard defense. If you get demo’d it means you did not do a good job avoiding it. Its an outplay like any other. Someone dunked on you with flip reset? You messed up the defense. Thats the best part of rocket league, if you are better you will outplay people and defend their shots. Or avoid their demos in this case.


"Demos take no skill!"

"Maybe not when I'm trying to demo YOU..."


Is that the teammate or opponent of the demoer, cause some demoers be messing up rotation hard.


If they don’t take skill then why do I miss demos so much? Lol


Best thing is the players that chase for demos, but when it comes for them to hit the ball they whiff or have a bad touch.
I feel this is true for 80% of people champ and under who chase demo's.


As a person who demos/bumps a whole lot, demoing/bumping is NOT easy. You have to actually hit them for one, an before you do that you have to position yourself in a way where if you miss the demo you can recover quickly. I do not want to hear "demoing is toxic" or "Demoing takes no skill." I want the people who call bumpers trash to tell that to all the pro players because they also use bumps a lot.


I love demos right. I mean my entire play style is a bit bumpy. Probably why my ones rank Is better than the rest. But really. I'd be cool if they added more of a bump like a blindness vs demo. Like airbag or whatever. Or just make bumps more integral. I don't think getting rid of demos will help the player who hate me


Omggggggggggg this is 100% accurate.


Demos in 1s feel a bit uncivilised but they are a legit mechanic. I make an effort to not demo in 1s but if the opponent intentionally demos me then I'm happy to do the same.

In other game modes demos are just a tool of the job. Some people get petty about it but most seem to accept it as normal.


Pretty sure hitting a smaller, moving car is a lot harder than hitting a larger, stationary ball


Well, I gotta use my *motor skills* to steer towards someone. Checkmate.


😂😂


It very much is the case with heat seeker. So it’s a cheap tactic there.


Demos are a based tactic

But if you do them in heatseaker you're scum


that's literally me when I am missing the demo and get scored on so I explain myself

to my friend how we could've scored and its not my fault, fr


it's always funny when I demo someone and I see Wow! 3 times in chat, like it's the first time someone demod them


Can not stand people purposely demoing in 1v1. Oh but it’s a “part of the game”, a pass interference is in the game but considered desperate if a CB did it to a WR at a 1 on 1 camp. If Lebron and KD 1v1 are they going to flagrant foul each other? No, it’s a part of the game in basketball but it’d be disrespectful to do it in a simple 1v1. 1v1s is about having better defense and or better offense. Demos in 2s and 3s don’t matter and if the 1v1 is for money then it don’t matter then


Demos are 10x more hurtful in 1v1s. There's not a single time you get a demo and there isn't someone saying "Ouch." or "Okay."


The last time I played 1's I had someone asking for my address because he had nothing to lose

Now chat is off when I play 1's 💀


Pov you are GC. Real talk though it's funny when I have GC's complaining about demos... Like... If you don't know how to avoid demos in GC that is totally on you at this point.


Absolutely hate 1s cuz I suck.


Pov: you play heatseeker


I mean they aren’t wrong, doesn’t mean I’m gonna stop demoing though


>That's not much incentive for me to fight fair, then, is it? 

-Jack Sparrow


>opponent: you wouldn't win without demos

>me: ~~yes~~ **is there a game mode without demos?**

FTFY


But also when they win, they very often tell me that it's because I'm going for demos too much. Weird.


… or ariels, or double jumping, hell who even boosts anymore??


Nice demo!


Well I like winning so... I demo


Yeah and I also wouldn't have won without hitting the ball


Which is why i *hate* 3s. I get demoed so much :(


which is exactly why I hate demos in Heatseeker - it's all the reward with literally 0 risk since you don't even need to invest boost


I recently started implementing demos in duos with my mate and finally broke out of diamond 3, it is a life changing revelation to watch car go boom and rank soar


Far-post is a double edged sword!   
    
It's generally the best spot to defend from, but it's the most likely spot to hit for demo hunting.


As someone who actually enjoys both goalkeeping and demoing, I absolutely welcome people trying to demo me. It’s fun and it makes me better at avoiding demos. Hell, I learn new tricks for my own demoing when I see how people try to demo me!

People who complain about demos just need to suck it up and accept that it is a legitimate game mechanic.


I highly recommend to all players that after setting up a pass to make a supersonic swing by the front of the opponents goal (always change my camera to front facing for this part so as to better aim) as they complete their rotation to take care of any goaltenders. Sometimes a bump is as good or better than a demo.

Lets you keep a good rotation without much risk and creates openings for your teammates. Same with rotating back to cover your own goal. If you can keep your speed up, bumps become demos.

My only complaint is that there's no points for demos (until you get an extermination) and it should count as a playmaker at least. There's many times a simple straight shot by a teammate would be easily blocked if there wasn't a bump/demo to help make it happen and no credit given in the score.


As you should


Gonna copy that next time someone complains about demos


Oooh, def. going te use this one.


based


My favorite is when someone rages over you demoing them in 1v1 and so they start trying to demo you back. But if you actually demo on the reg you learn pretty quickly when you’re exposed to it so it’s easy to just jump/dodge out of the way. More often than not this results in me scoring easy goals because they put themselves out of position to demo, miss the demo, and leave an open net for me to score on. It also proves that you can dodge demos just as easily as you can do them (meaning demos aren’t the problem, their inability to read/dodge them is the problem.) 

Can’t tell you how many games this has happened to me and it almost always results in a forfeit.


they’re mad cuz bad. demos are only easy against poorly skilled opponents, otherwise i have to work for it. anyone who says it’s a non-skill or noob tactic are just easy targets.


I usually throw out a “Nice one!” when I get hit with one. However, 8 in a row can get a bit annoying…


As someone who doesn't give two shits about winning or losing a match, getting relentlessly aimed at for demos never seems to have a positive outcome, they end up either being shitty winners or leave mid match if they're losing.

Dafuq is all that people who only care about winning doing in casual matches anyways?


It’s the same mentality as people who blame their teammates for all their own mistakes. They think they are playing the game perfectly and everyone else is playing it wrong


bruh you scoring on me too much you wouldn’t win if you didn’t score, nerd


But it's *fun*


>Teams or parties with one dedicated demoer who can barely aerial and just races around chasing people down (with GC car control btw), when it isn't even strategically relevant or even smart, that's just bullshit. I hate those. Luckily those teams usually lose because it's a shit strategy, and they're usually toxic as well so it's satisfying to beat their ass.

This.


Can’t believe they are using bumps smh. These people have no competitive integrity


Demolitions are when you blow someone’s car up by driving into them at high speed


"You only won because you had better kickoffs and bumps"

Yes. Git gud.


This.  I usually type okay,  followed by 'my turn'.  Them being salty is icing on the cake.


Jumping is a hard mechanic


I completely agree. Also, I have a lot more fun in heatseeker games without demos, but at the end of the day there’s nothing wrong with demoing. If the other team starts doing it I’ll just do it right back


bro im a G2 fan do i play like atomic now. I either get 8 demos a game or score a double reset


Honestly I can see it. If your teammate is super mechanical which a lot of gc2 players are, you can just set them up for offense and then either help out with demos or stay back to play off the shot. And this is talking about 2s, 3s it’s even safer


the reason you get demoed is probably so the opponent can score a goal and win but idk


I wonder how many games I've won by dodging the demo and the guy dribbling is teeing it up for me. Bump plays are automatic double commits. Get better.


Tell that to all the pros.


You're the one getting angry about people playing that virtual car soccer in a different way from you.


Yes, they really won. If people are beating you based purely on demos, it should be pretty easy to see that you need to work on avoiding demos. Same energy as “Bro I would win if you would just stop flicking the ball”


Imagine not being able to dodge bumps.


How is it cheap? It's a mechanic of the game and everyone can use it so it's not cheap in any way


Can you explain? I don't understand how exactly this is a cheap tactic or how it makes less skilled players "stronger."


The rate of demos goes up the higher in rank you go, actually. Can't be a cheap tactic for low-rank players if even the best players in the world use it. Also, going for dumb demos is easily punishable, making it balanced and not cheap.


Most of the best pro teams use constant demos. Those cheap pros!

Demolitions are when you drive into someone’s car at high speed to blow them up


A demolition is running into your opponents car at a high speed to blow them up


No you are a threat and it was calculated


A demolition is running into your opponents car at a high speed to blow them up


I like it because it's a core mechanic, maybe try getting out of the way 🙏🏻


I usually hit em with the "This is Rocket League!"


Im just like “aw damn”

If I demo in 1v1 it's a desperate ploy. If I get demo'd it starts up without care of losing the game, just sheer annoyance on them xD had games where no quick chats were used during a demo spree. Won 7 to 6... got ugly lol


Huge risk reward. If you miss you’re fucked and out of the play


last time I played 1v1 i had a dude saying i sucked and am a ball chase, i beat him 5-1   i mean the whole point of the game is to hit the ball i dont know what he wanted me to do.


Should’ve invited him over for a drink or two and a night of rl


And thats The point


Yeah...you wouldn't win if you stopped playing defense. 🤯


Knockout lol


won many heatseeker games just because an opponent won’t help out his teammate defending instead of chasing for a demo they can’t get, so it’s basically a 2v1 but for other modes it’s the same as well


The only way to avoid demos is to get good at demos.


Exactly, demos in Heatseeker is awfull! I just want to enjoy the game mode but 90% of the games is just avoiding demos at this moment :(


if you're snuggled in far post, you either see the demo coming (if they come from near post), or you're shielded by the post if they're coming from far post (rare).


Hell, even the demo *attempt* can be enough to get the defender out of position and miss a save


I always do the "dirtbag sweep" on offense: center the ball, then charge across the opponent's goal line and take their corner boost before rotating back to center field. 

I'm not necessarily trying to get a bump/demo in the sweep, but charging through the middle of their defense creates chaos. You end up creating a ton of pressure with the combo of center+demo threat+boost steal


My absolute favorite type of bump is when your teammate is challenging a shot on net and you bump the defender like 6 times, throwing them way off of the save


There was an interesting post by the devs years ago, when they introduced certs, I think, that they mentioned how they wanted to incentive stuff that can lead people to throw games by pursuing certain stuff. That's why there are no chalenges for saying, doing X aerial goals, X demos, X turtle goes, etc

By that logic, I wonder if somehow they think giving points to demo may encourage people to simply spend games demoing for points and end up ruining casual or something like that.


even more than a demo I like knocking opponents up inconvenient walls, preferably while also stealing their boost.


>anyone who says it’s a non-skill or noob tactic are just easy targets.

And also causing a self burn. I mean if demos take no skill and you are losing to demos then...


And thusly demo-dodging is a skill!


Idk Im in Champ 2 and still get demoed by opponents who do nothing but demo. 

Its hard not to get demoed when they come from your blind spots.

Usually the one who dedicate themselves to demo is sub par in mechanics and game sense and really rely on their teammates to carry them. 

It also is a double edged sword when they go for demoes 100% of the time. They give up positioning and opens up a lot of opportunities for the other team, basically making it 1vs2 for your teammate. 

Now people who do technical demoes are totally different. They do it during rotations and opens up a lot of opportunities for their team.

I get mad when someone does nothing but demo cause its downright annoying. But technical demoes and thought out demoes are fine


Seriously. If you're sitting in the net and getting mad about getting blown up over and over, then get gud.


Literally demos are actually hard since you need to predict where they’re going to go plus you need good boost management if you’re just going for demos and demo dodging is a bit easier since you just have to jump/flip out of the way or brake check to avoid it most of the time


Not necessarily. Demos only become annoying when someone is just straight up chasing demos, example; someone demos you over and over and over in your spawn to the point where you can’t even do anything. Demos are easy to get on any player but I will agree that lower levels are alot easier to hunt down


i would really like to understand how someone's brain could take that turn to think the person who was exploded is the bad one, i mean, you are the one that needs to have less opponents in the pitch because without that advantage you couldn't score

i understand demo as a last case scenario strategy, like when is the only thing you can do to avoid a goal, but your mindset makes people who explode other players to create an advantage feel free to act like that thinking it's a valid strategy

my last time playing against someone like that was yesterday on a heatseeker match where one of the other team guys keep himself on our half of the pitch (which is normal) but exploding us. the point is that my teammate wasn't good and the opponent that kept on their net was decent, so i had to play for two WHILE i had to be prepared for the ball and the other opponent behind me, and even tho i was able to dodge him most of the times, it was a real pain in the ass + the trashtalk


Right.  A good and well timed demo is a solid tactic just like interfering to prevent an odd man rush, or dumping the ball to clear the zone. Annoying at times?  Sure.  Because it's devastating to your game ahah


Same. I always put, "Thanks!".

Like, I honestly don't care. In 2s and 3s it actually puts me back in a good position half the time.

And most of the time it's actually easy enough to see them coming and jump or drive around them.

It's not like I haven't had my games where I've been blown up over and over, but I've never been mad about it.

 But I'm one of those people who will say, "What a save!" to myself when I fuck up. I've had people get mad at me because they just assume I'm talking shit to them, when I'm really saying it to myself.


If you got hit with a demo 8 times in a row, you're at fault.


Exactly. Most of the time they lack the awareness to even see it coming, which you usually can from a mile away.


I always say to these people "wait you're using boost? A core mechanic? Noob"


Oh ok gotcha thanks


Haha exactly. If someone says 'you only won because of your kickoffs' they basically mean 'my kickoffs are so ass I'm losing 1s games to it'. xd


Defo, músic to my ears hagagagaagga


You literally have to lift your finger, and then drop it on the bottom button on the right hand side of the controller. Its....so much wooooork!


I have a clip I saved the other day that I wanna post in here showing you the type of demos I’m talking about. He didn’t demo me but he was chasing and trying but there was no reason for it. My teammates were at the opponents goal with the ball and I was rotating back to mid/back field and the dude just kept chasing me. Like why😂


Salty comment is salty.


Sure


The internet is full of dumb people. There, conversation over.


It's a little cheep. It's the mechanic new players rely on to feel useful. It's the noobtube of rl. Edit: I love how triggered you all are. This meme of OPs is not accurate xD


Its a reference to a show about gay space rocks. Honestly just shit posting idfc about demos. There's also some parallels to make with the old noob tube from cod games. My wife loves demos because it's the only thing she feels she can do when playing.


Ohhh that makes sense lol. 

There goes my signature move.


Ah, thanks


I'm going to have to start saying this when I get demoed 😂


Ever since they made that challenge that you have to say it for challenge in 3 different matches I’ve been seeing it a lot more. It’s always hilarious


Savage!


Oooo, that’s gooood


Lmao same, I hate that my kickoff is so ass and instantly have to start defending every time from kickoff. However, it’s still the best mode at the very highest level for entertainment imo. The amount of mind games and crazy shit the top top players do is fascinating to watch


Everyone's replying to this as if we've got any obligation to our opponent lol. I'm _going_ to make it excruciating difficult for any opponent going for a fancy play or something I can't defend. Best believe I'm playing dirty heh


It's a 1v1 with no teammates. How dare you chase the ball away from your opponent


Ball chasing is not the intent of 1v1. 1v1 is a turn based game mode where you go for mechanically challenging shots, alternating who goes.

Edit: apparently this needs a /S or it is taken way to literally


Nah, you gotta let him have his turn!


Lol ball chasing in 1s? Haha. We'll someone has to go after the ball!


When you knock someone out, their car gets demoed iirc. So, technically, there are no modes without demos.


I usually just have one of my gc friends chase me down in a private to train that


This is the way


Really? Never have seen anyone do that and atm I fail to see how it would eben be good? Isnt it super obvious? Just dodge?


I'm only a diamond 1 division 2, so alot of these people see me comin and just sit there


I call this Pavlovian training. After a demo or two, they just flinch whenever you get near them.


THIS. This is the way.


I also do this. Sometimes people get scared and to avoid being demoed/bumped by me they miss the ball :)


My favorite is when an attacker is setting up to go for the ball and I bump him from behind sending him out of the way. Teammate gets the clear and my team ends up in a 2v1 situation at the enemy goal 😇


In many games, the threat of an action is more powerful than the action itself. When I'm having a bad game but my teammates aren't, and I'm on support, all I have to do is drive towards the opponent defending the goal.

I don't have to get the demo or even the bump. Moving out of my way is the same as giving my teammate an open net, especially if the opponent jumped or used a dodge.

*Edit: I don't even care that there's really no stat for this except a W*


Couple weeks back I jumped over an opponent who was trying to demo me from behind going the same direction. They passed under me, so as I landed I hit a wave dash and exploded them from behind. His teammate panic hit the ball, centering it so my teammate could score the goal. 10/10


Ive literally trained demo dodging skills. If you have any gc friends, inv them to a game of king of the hill. Where one team has 1 player and the other team has the rest and if the 1 player gets a demo on the other team, the killer and victim switch teams. Helps in ranked when you get demo chased and you wanna smoothly maintain speed


You say that - and I agree. Clear the goal? Sure. Eliminate the assist? Of course.

But in my experience the vast majority of demos are not that. Not even close.

On top of that you have lots of people that **think** they're doing something strategic but are just demoing to demo.


Then you know I'm out of position all the time. That gives you an advantage.


That makes the other team 1 short as well. Fair match.


If they miss the demo, you are usually at an advantage. Get more aware of your surroundings.


> people who explode other players to create an advantage feel free to act like that thinking it's a valid strategy

Literally the reason the devs put it in the game. 


I also like to fake people so that I have 0 opponents infront of me on the pitch. That makes me bad too I guess?


this post is about you



>thinking it's a valid strategy

It is a valid strategy


It’s an intended game mechanic that has pros and cons, the same as aerials and pinches. Allowing yourself to get tilted by it only makes it more effective


The person getting demoed needs less people on the pitch in order to have time to execute the plays they want to, otherwise they wouldn’t be getting demoed. 

Sorry but if you want people to just let you sit in goal or at attacking mid waiting for the ball to come down for you to make a play, you just suck. Be aware of where your opponents are and how you can play the ball where it is.


Ur who this post is about


>you are the one that needs to have less opponents in the pitch because without that advantage you couldn't score

It's easier to 1 person to score on 3 defending opponents than it is for 2 people to score on 1 defender.

Why is that? Because 3 defenders usually bump each other away from the incoming shot, and because most Rocket League players can't receive a pass harder than a fluffy lob.

>it was a real pain in the ass + the trashtalk

The correct setting for chat is "off."


You are asking a lot here


well i do this sometimes, basically when my team begins an attack i sometimes rush straight to the defender to demo/bump him and turn the ball cam off. during the time it takes mo te get there sometimes the possession of the ball changes for the opponents while i'm still chasing the gk

like, i know it's not a good strategy, but i understand it


The irony...you are salty you can't dodge bumps. get gud


Just jump?


Someone better tell Squishy, Comm, Ayyjayy, Allushin, and Gyro about this! How embarrassing would it be for them to play in RLCS using a noob tactic‽


Wait WHAT? You used an INTENDED FEATURE IN A GAME? Absolutely disgraceful, anyways I would be a higher rank if my teammates weren’t trash /s


Is it cheap to knock an opponent off his line? It’s not much different


Yeah some people get really mad about demos so that’s what I was highlighting here


I replaced "This is [RL]" from what was "Sorry!"
Now when I accidently take a boost.
"This is Rocket League!"


No better way to improve kickoffs than 1s.


There should be a dedicated Freestyle queue where this is an actual thing. 

Mostly so the folks who enjoy that will stop bothering those of us who enjoy Rocket League.


Lol


Interesting take. So when you miss, you just let your opponent score because it's his turn? That's really nice of you! Yet from my experience I doubt anyone who played for longer then a week will return the favor.

I think that the intent of 1v1 is to beat your opponent within the games rules, as with every game, and I really couldn't care less how my opponents think about that 😂 

I demo people to make them angry and lure them out to go after me, leaving their goal open. It works surprisingly well.

Turn based rocket league sounds boring af, but to each their own 😅


Idk. In the RL subreddit I have said that 1's is pretty much a ball chasers game and gotten a lot of upvotes. I agree about the turn taking aspect though. I have played that way too, but I think that if you can control time of possession in a singles match, you control the scorecard. It's a bit different in teams, because possession changes so quickly, and you can get "stole on" at the drop of a hat. In singles, a solid player can read the steal coming and knows if they miss the steal they have no backup. In the same respect, if you are going for a steal and read it properly in singles, you know that there is no backup for the other player after the steal. That's not mentioning demos, which I believe was the core of this post. All of this being noted, demos are a LETHAL singles bracket STRATEGY, albeit painful. 
It boils down to old school Chinese fighting principles. Who's Kung Fu is better. Going up against someone with a different style than yourself is the whole point of the bracket. We all constantly modify our own styles in order to outperform each other. In the end, there's only one Ip Man. We just need to strive for a higher oneness and mastery.


Uhh pretty sure you just do whatever it takes to get more points than your opponents. If I can demo you before you hit the ball when its your “turn,” best believe I will.


POV: NA 1v1


So to made an unofficial rule for 1s lol....sorry man. This is called freestyle.


grand plat blue dawg cmon


Your car explodes under certain conditions, yes, but if you bump someone a supersonic speed, aka demoing, they do not blow up. I would disagree that demoing is in knockout. People can't demo themselves but in knockout if they fly out far enough, they explode cause it's not a "demo" in the proper sense. It's a knockout. Even the game calls one a knockout and the other a demolition. The Fandom even defines demolition as "only occurs when one player bumps another while moving at supersonic" or at least it's something like that.


Yeah dude just dodge as the ball is flying into your net. Ez pz


Well it happens to me a lot and yeah sure it's obvious and I can sure dodge them but that's not why I go into a game of Heatseeker. I don't join a Heatseeker game just to dodge someone who tries to demo me, I join those matches to have fun keeping the ball out of my goal.


Nothing more satisfying than watching someone flub a save cause they jumped when you drove in their general vicinity.


That's similar to a mindset I have not related to demos but to just messing up opponents. As an example, if you are chasing after someone and can't get your ideal action then even just hitting the ball, hitting their car, or anything can have a compounding effect.

I've found it can be beneficial to mess the other team up even if means making moves that seem bad. You end up throwing them off because they weren't expecting it and, since you were expecting it, you give yourself the opportunity to recover faster and get the ball.

Basically playing rocket league like a full contact sport.


And everyone clapped?


How can you have an advantage if you’re being spawn trapped…?


comparing its "pros and cos" with aerial and pinches makes no sense, any con of those two are just collateral effects while the whole point about demos are about how you cannot score in a fair situation


how the hell you just supposed that i "sit in the goal" or attack or whatever? lmao that makes no sense and say so much about you demo guys


Especially when you have to get out of the way. I seriously cant bro. You're mistaking me for season 6 world champion, SquishyMuffins


...what are you talking about?


Interrobang. Nice


Bet you would.


I replaced “Okay” with “This is Rocket League” so now whenever I get salty I send “This is RL” instead, making me remember it’s just a game and to laugh it off


Lmao I went from using it for sorry.  Now it's my faking and sorry bound


I actually like this idea. Maybe instead of traditional serves, the ball alternates placement in front of your car between goals, similar to how Heatseeker serving is. Each goal or "round" that you're in possession of the ball, you get a 15 second timer before the ball disappears if it touches the ground(similar to a training pack) and is set to the opponents side whether a goal is scored or not. 

I'm sure there could be a better way, but this is just me playing off your idea. Would make for some interesting matches for sure.


No, when you miss you grab boost and the opponent let's you recover. They then go for a free style. This isn't how your 1s games go?


I'm totally kidding haha. Going for mechanical shots if you can can't stay close to the ball or have control is absolutely not a good strategy.


He might have been sarcastic, just might have.


You watched Johnny's last stream didn't you


Heh?


I see. I always thought about demo being the general term for when a car gets blown to pieces. TIL, I guess :D


there are 2 people guarding the net. so best case if the attacker is succesful, its only 1 guy guarding and the other is demoed, while on the other side its only 1 guy guarding guaranteed. how is that an advantage for the attackers side?


Yeah I always try to break the rhythm of the opponents game. Like you said, a small touch can redirect the ball enough to throw the whole enemy team off. I scored many goals like this. And many, many demoes hehe


I would clap.


I clapped


everyone clapped.  (still probably happened)


How often are you completely neutralized from games via spawn traps versus just strategic demos or random field change demos?


Since respawning is random, a demo chain can't last forever. Then just don't get demo'd again.


Actually nevermind. Saw the 7k demo badge and not even gonna try to explain this to you


That’s like saying boost stealing is bad because it gives you an advantage. No shit, they’re opponents, you’re supposed to put yourself in advantageous positions.


Then dodge them and create an advantage


There is nothing unfair about demos. At all. It’s a game mechanic like any other, and it is YOUR responsibility to learn how to avoid demos.

All you’re doing by refusing to accept the reality of the situation is making it easier for your opponents to rile you up and take the match into their own hands.

You either need to get used to demoing or consider the possibility that maybe Rocket League isn’t the game for you.


Forgot the /s


Oi, we have ourselves a good chap here


This exactly what happened for me as well.  Works really well, and not getting upset keeps my head level and in the game.


So by this logic I would lose every one's game (not far off from where I already am though). As someone who is mechanically challenged my play book consists of pass plays and open nets.


Opponent let's you recover and you let them freestyle. I need your dope 😂


Didnt have the /s mustve been dead serious /s


Good guess, but I am dead, dead, dead serious.


Lmfaooo, u mean last 20?


your rank says grand plat but you dont have the grand plat icon thing


To be fair, I wouldn't give someone shit for saying they got demoed in knockout. Shii, I usually say "i got edged" or something along those line cause of all the hours I played Rumble Fighter back in the day. But in reply to someone getting particular, I'm gonna get particular too 😜


My Rocket League mantra is to make it awkward for the opponent. Slow it down when they expect me to go fast, boom it when they expect me to take it slow, in field pass when they're expecting a shot,  steal their boost, bump, fake challenge, etc., etc.


I am honored, sir.


Ayyy what you doing out of your natural habitat?


Honestly, quite often. But that’s also from my personal experience


That’s alot easier to say my guy than it is done.


Nothing to "explain" mate. You're not my coach.


“You’re not good enough to beat me when I have boost, that’s why you boost starve me”

I don’t understand how people think like this


even tho it's *kinda* similar you are, again, making no sense comparisons since we have lots of mechanics all about how you can speed yourself without boost while when you get demoed you just can sit and watch the opponent having an instant open net


LMAOOOOO why you guys so dramatic? i play this literally since 2016 or even before, but yeah, rocket league isn't for me because i just don't like being exploded! it's funny how you guys set the things up like i am the one crying about demos when i specifically said how i just think it's a braindead way to play the game while you all being offended by that, i mean, go on, continue to explode your opponents, it's just a car football videogame lmao


No that's how mmr works silly, if ur better ur teammates are too.


Dead wrong too


Oh. Yeah, I’ll never change my OG GC tag for anything but I still wanna be honest about what I am at heart lol


It all comes down to one thing: it doesn't matter if you say "demo", "knockout", or any other term... 

At the end of the day, your car blows up anyway :P


Yeah... that means something... different


Yeah, must be one incredibly unlucky personal experience because I’ve played the game for like 5 years and the most I’ve been spawn trapped is like 3 consecutive times. And sometimes it ends with a goal against, but camping spawns is more of a troll than it is an actual good strategy. For 99% of the player base your probably exaggerated experience isn’t relatable


The average 2v2 game at GC1 has 3 demos in it. Total. Lower ranks, even less. Your experience is not the reality of most people's games.


Most I've been demo'd in a row was twice. Pretty easy I would say.


Never said I was, just knew that I’d be basically talking to wall after I saw the 7k demo badge


Nah, you're crying about demos. That's exactly what calling it a "braindead way to play the game" is. YOU are the one that bitched about it, YOU are the one that came across as offended by it, so don't try to spin that around on anyone but yourself.


Not in Rumble Fight 😁 it meant to knock someone off the edge of the map!


I mean hey to each their own🤷🏿‍♂️ guess I have bad luck. I too have been playing rl over 5 years now and have had plenty of games with 5+ demos. Actually about a 2-3 months ago I got demo’d 10 times by a guy in a single game. If I can find the replay, I’ll try to upload on the sub


I’m glad that’s the most you’ve been demo’d, but alot of us have been in the double digits in a single game


Much like talking to someone so convinced that an in game mechanics is somehow unfair or toxic


you guys keep saying that a person that's being exploded is the bad one, it's not me trying to spin things around lol


Dude what rank are you because there is literally no answer other than you are horrible at avoiding demos and probably also just have awful game iq in general. I don’t even get demo’d that often and if someone tried chasing demos to the point where they could even get 10 in a game, they’d lose the game for the same exact reason


Would love to see that clip.


I would consider that being impressive rather than getting upset


Never said it was unfair, if it’s apart of the game then you can’t argue much about it. Is it toxic? Depends on the scenario. It’s one thing to go for a demo or bunch if it will lead to an immediate score, buts it’s also another thing for one or 2 guys on the opposing team to just head hunt a player the entire match and not once even make a play for the ball


You're not bad if you get demoed, you're bad if you get pissy about it and let it get under your skin so your opponents can take advantage of you.

Demos have been in the game since it came out and they will continue to be a part of the game into the future. Deal with it.


When you reach a certain level people don't cry about it as much because they seem to understand that it's one of the mechanics to use to better your game. People that do cry about being demo'd kind of show their own level without understanding it.


No demo goals are not toxic. They reacted how they did probably partially because of how you slowed down instead of shooting. I personally have no problem with that you have them a chance if anything.


I consider trying to spawn-demo a bit toxic, but otherwise not at all. It frustrates me how easy it seems and yet I am so bad at them, but it's fair game.


I kinda pride myself in these sorts of goals.  I mainly play 3v3 in low to mid tier champ level.  People often don’t get overly upset, occasionally a player might abandon their rotation to chase me if I demo them multiple times.  Usually results in a lot of giggles in my discord call


I personally find demoing really annoying and tilting, but I think it's like using the most overpowered gun in shooter games. It's annoying, but you still have to learn how to counter it. If you can't counter it, then play better and make the difference in some other way.


Nah, people just take everything way too seriously...


No, but saying “what a save” after a demo absolutely is 😈


To be honest, demo goals aren't toxic  but gloating and taunting them on the goal line CAN BE SEEN as toxic, personally i don't mind because its just a bit of banter/strategy in a game but some people have reacted very 'passionatly' to it

Edit: fixed spelling, emphasised phrase.


I always assume the person getting angry at demos is either a child or has the emotional intelligence of one.

The best is when they rage and start trying to demo back, but repeatedly fail because they haven't learned that you can single jump to avoid them pretty easily.


I personally love when people do demo play’s but people who demo just to be obnoxious that’s annoying


Its only toxic if it happens to yourself


Bumps and demos are a pretty key part in high level games I find especially.


I would say if they are, then only in Casual modes. Competitive its ah-okay all the way!


Fuck that dude anyway.  Who FFs only down 2 with 3 and a half minutes left???


No, but people who chase demos the whole game are imo. That's why I spam "Nice Demo!" every time they try but fail


It’s frustrating to me because where I hang out (gold 3/plat 1 ones) people use it as a crutch. They have terrible rotations and awareness, miss 90% of their air shots, but go for demos non stop and then act like they’re the shit when they score on you.


Youre the 8 bazillionth person to ask this question, no it still isnt


I feel bad getting a demo goal on accident, but so so good when it’s on purpose


I hate them. But its a built in game mechanic.  Just gotta get better at avoiding them.


Nahhhh, if you complain about being demo'd that shows more about yourself than the opponent, if it was such a toxic mechanic they'd have removed it from competitive as a whole, but it's there cuz it's a valid form of attack and defense, same as bumping, in duos when you're on the recieving end of a cross, me and my friend will always try to bump/demo the player waiting for the cross, perfectly valid tactic


YOU'RE THE FUCKER WHO TOOK MY NAME. I FOUND YOU. YOU'RE THE REASON I HAVE TO USE SHIVV3RZ WITH A 3!! I was so confused when I saw that.


It's part of the game. People who complain should simply have better awareness


Wouldn't call it toxic but it fuuucking sucks to get demoed. But next time I'll remember. :)


I don't think demo goals are toxic but the argument "it's a part of the game" makes no sense. There are plenty of things considered "toxic" in video games that are also part of the game


They cant be toxic because demo is a mechanic in a game. Demo can be tactical, like yours, or can be just for the sake of demo. I use second one from time to time, when I see opponents get mad, so it tilts them even more.


So not toxic but how you pulled up and waited for the ball to roll slowly in then quick chatted what a save is pretty BM on the verge of toxic.


The only thing I would've done differently is slow that ball down even more.


Demos aren’t toxic when they are smart and make sense, but the moment you start throwing the game just to sexually harass my car, its just to be annoying which is toxic in my opinion.


When I get demoed I usually say "Wow!" once just for shits and giggles


When me - Yes!

When I'm - Not!

It's simple


I love when people get tilted about an aspect of the game. This is part of what makes this game great. It’s not about just focusing on the ball. You need to be aware of what’s also going on around you.


I mean, I don't demo unless the other team is toxic. Cant say I'm too thrilled when someone blows me up to get a goal.


Use all mechanics of the game to win. Physical play is important.


The what a save after he disconnected is always just a cherry on top🤌🏻


They are if you spam "Wow!" after you do one. 

That and frikkin "What A Save!"


They’re not toxic, they’re delicious 🤤❤️


The slow roll into the goal is the “toxicity”


If you werent supposed to be able to do it, you wouldnt be able to. Toxicity is being mean to your opponent for no reason, so a demo goal when you are losing is fine, or trying to take the lead. It would be toxic if you were already winnimg.


Fair game like a lot of people said... Being able to avoid demos is skill and so is demoing. Timing a demo correctly isn't easy


I've been playing since the SARPBC days, and have come to realize a few things:

1. Demos are a mechanic of the game. If you're gonna get butthurt about getting demoed, don't play the game. That simple.

2. That being said, there are some times when demoing can be unsportsmanlike. Repetitive demos in situations where they don't give you a competitive advantage or doing it in 1s when you're up by a million can be rude, just because it's so annoying and unnecessary.


It's part of the game for a reason, not toxic


No they are not but the way you waited for the ball to come in is toxic af 💀


How could it be toxic? (genuine question)


Some people find it toxic. Thats allright. I will still demo tf out of everybody whenever I get the chance.

You get to meet lots of salty people that way. But hey.  If they get salty I will demo even more. And sometimes a "fake" demo where you see them jumping and then suddenly you change direction just to mess with their heads.

Or even more fun when they demo chase you and you avoid them while quickchatting "close one!" And then demo them instead.

As you can see. I like demo'ing.


It’s a great way to play the game if you ask me


[deleted]


No


I'd say in 1v1 it's a lot more acceptable. It's annoying, but not hard to counter.


Naw. If you're in my way and don't avoid a demo, it's your fault.


Bro it’s tactic and strategy In my opinion they can do it too. we all can do it, it’s part of the game.


There’s a lot of sensitive players who get butt hurt easily playing RL. In my opinion whatever you have to do to win is fair game.


I don’t understand what people who are against demos think should happen when two opposing cars collide. If you turn off demos you’ll just go flying like if your teammate had bumped you. Do they want the cars to drive through each other? Do they want colliding with the opponent to be punished somehow? 

It just doesnt make sense to be anti-demo. it is a necessary part of the game, it takes a high amount of skill to pull off, a large amount of game sense to pick the right times, and failure or mistiming pulls you out of position and is usually punished by the opponents scoring on you. Its a high skill play that is necessary and logical. I just don’t understand the mindset of somebody who is against it.

A demo is nothing like, for example, a grenade or rocket launcher in a shooting game, which can legitimately be broken/cheap/overpowered if not properly balanced by the developers. Its more like a rocket launcher in a shooting game where if you miss your target you instantly die every time.


You scored a goal by outplaying the other guy. I'll let you decide if thats toxic


No.


Demo goals are not toxic, they're a genuine strategy and works very well. People get mad at demos because it's something most people aren't used to. The people that get really toxic because of demos, as Wayton Pilkin said, You're Bad.


I find that player are more toxic when my team demos a lot. No idea why. Does it hurt them? Going for repeat demos can be bm but if it's part of the play I don't see a reason to get upset


It’s a part of the game in my opinion. Like anything else you can be toxic with it by trying to spawn demo or go for only demos but there are a bunch of ways to use it effectively


The road to gc about demos

1. cry
2. trying to accept it
3. accept it
4. Inner death bc it is a game mechanic 
5. Use it urself in the  higher ranks


I'm usually not too pressed about it if it's a good play. If they completely disregard the ball for 3 minutes to try and demo so they can score, I just call em a noob over and over again until their soul fills with rage to the point they make endless mistakes of letting me win


I have a problem with people not playing the game and just driving around demoing.

Demoing for a goal, or save, it's fine cos there's a reason showing its calculated. Not just driving around carchasing.

Same with bumping.


Demoing is meh but i hate when people just wont stop demoing. Im playing for fun stop stomping my happiness out thank you. Plus i play with my girlfriend so its not like we're asking for a tough game, just a fun time


Nope


Honestly, when it happens to me I get mad. However, it's a perfectly legitimate strategy that isn't toxic at all.


No


It’s not toxic if it’s done properly and normally. If you were to just run around the field bumping and demoing, that’s not really rocket and you’re probably gonna lose anyway. But proper demo’s show awareness and gamesense and are part of the game for a reason.


I've never understood people who cry about getting demo'd. It's a mechanic used to help you win. I'm not cheating, I'm picking and choosing my moment to strike because I gathered that you were in a bad spot so I took advantage of it. 

Don't like it, don't play.


In unranked I feel like they can be toxic if thats your main strategy. But if you just hit a nice demo goal every once in a while its not bad lol. In ranked who cares do whatever it takes to win.


When I gets to the point that the other team is driving to your net and demos you constantly, that’s toxic


I dont find demo plays toxic as much as I find head hunting toxic. A demo play is just a mechanic of the game you can learn. Only time I find it toxic is when a member of the team stops playing the ball and only goes for demos. Again it's a mechanic you can't fault the guy but wreckfest is a better game if your only interest is hitting someone


Complaining about demos in Rocket League is the same as complaining about kill steals in mobas


Someone please explain to me how this is justifiably toxic lol. If you get mad when an opponent demos you perhaps YOU are the toxic player.


My own personal opinion is that I don’t like it because it takes zero skill to demo and then shoot on an empty net. Unless you’re Athena…then you need skills to hit open nets.


The problem here is you slowing down instead of hitting the ball into the net. That's disrespectful. Don't do that


i used to think they were but now i think they're not only when they're tactical because sometimes they can be toxic, like if a player always goes for a specific player because they're a girl, in my experience this happens often


Not toxic, but typically a display of someone with lesser skill. Pretty easy to tell when all they can do is demo, so if you dodge they 9/10 will leave openings. In my experience, bumping (at correct times) is a far more superior option. If your main goal is to demo then you're the easiest person in the world to counter and you'll likely lose for your team, a lot.


It's tactical. Not toxic. When I do wall shots that I know are going in. I'll fly down not to air dribble. I go straight for defender.


« It’s in the game »


Negative


no


Not toxic.  
  
People who think demos are toxic are people who don't want to play Rocket League.


Who cares if it's toxic or not?  It's part of the game and fair.


If you focus demoing my car more than hitting the ball. It is.


It’s kind of gay, but at the same time demo’s are a game mechanic. 

It stings because it’s cheap. If all your goals are demos you’re a loser, but if you get a clutch goal by demoing a goalie not paying attention it’s alright


when you stop like that it is


Yes


Only thing that was a little toxic was letting it roll in instead of finishing it.


if it was toxic it wudnt be in the game.


Demoing full stop isn't toxic. Not in the slightest.


when people bitch ab it I'll type in the chat "Press A to jump." Lmao


A goal is a goal


I play HEAVY on demos and bumping. I’ve created so many scoring opportunities. Yeah, I’ve missed and caused issues with positioning, but the more I practice the better I get. The best is bumping / demoing at aerial level, such a blast.


if it's in the game deal with it.


No but they are hilarious


No unless that literally your only mechanic


Nein. Higher level games - bumps/demos = meta


Demos are a FUN high-risk high-reward mechanic creating new possibilities for skilful and interesting play


It's a mechanic in the game. Nothing wrong with it. But I bet if you honestly look at your motivation for letting the ball slowly run into the net after your demo, you can see where they are coming from.


No.


In my experience I usually see people look unfavorably towards demos, if I ever do it people usually spam chat or type something unsavory. Idk why people act like it's such a shitty thing to do. It's literally built into the game. There aren't fouls in RL, and frankly I don't think enough people use it. Sometimes I'll go in first and just bump the piss out of whoever is playing goalie, decent amount of time it at least gives my teammates a decent shot at the goal.


It’s as toxic as a ceiling shot, some ones found a Mechanic that’s useful and now it’s commonly used in competitive games. People who get mad about it, get over yourselves.


Guess I didn't know this was something that was "frowned" upon?? Why else would it be in the game if you aren't supposed to utilize it as a strategy? Are you not supposed to play defense?


Demo's are a part of the game. People that say they are toxic are just made they don't have the coordination to add it as a part of their strategy.


Dude demos is the  only  strategy I  play  in  heat seekér  really   takes them by surprise  it's  the  best to watch  them run out of the goal  when  the  ball is  coming  in


No and anyone that seriously cries when they're demoed or calls them cheap are just babies.


Not at all


NOPE!


people get so mad for no reason LMAO


Anybody who leaves a match down 2 with more than 3 minutes to go is a pussy and a coward.  Just play the fucking game.


They're a part of the game. I start to use them more if I get the impression it's tilting the enemy team.

I want to win.


They're toxic to people who don't know how to handle them. I stopped getting tilted and started respecting them (or question why) once I started using them


If you think that getting demoed once or twice in a game is toxic please uninstall


What a saving them is kinda toxic after something like this


Yes its toxic


yes


Yes


If I play 1v1 and I meet someone who mainly plays rocket-demo-league I'll just FF and leave instantly maybe drop a salty comment "nice playstyle", "you're really good" - but it is a part of the game as all the comments state (we should all be aware of it at this point...) I however don't enjoy it and ergo don't do it. In 3's and 2's sure but never been a menace to someone. Sure I want to win as much as every RL player, but it's so rare I go for 1v1 and the rank doesn't matter nearly as much to me as 2's and 3's. I would like to state that I don't think "A demo goal isn't toxic", but plural in the same game in 1v1 is very toxic (IMO). You know the ones that play like this want you to flame them because that's the type of person they are. They love drinking the salty tears - so it's better not to say anything just FF and leave.  
TLDR; I just can't be bothered with someone who only goes for demo goals in 1v1 - if it's all you can I leave.


Demo goals when you’re winning by a decent amount are pretty toxic, otherwise if people get touched about it when you’re losing they’re just toxic themselves


That's the name of the game. Literally. Most rockets explode or are used to blow things up.


How is it toxic?  It's literally a mechanic coded into the game by developers.  It's like saying getting melee kills in an fps is toxic cause you were supposed to headshot me bro.  

People are dumb.  Can't just make up rules and expect others to follow them, let alone agree.


Lez be real, if you demo in 1v1 you're a dick. Idgaf how long you've been playing. Dick move.


It really annoys me when some comments in any way to me demoing them so I proceed to chase them down and try to demo them as much as possible as a punishment. In this case yes demoing is toxic


I just think about it in the same way as if i was on a soccer field. If i was trying to score and someone, or myself just eliminated the goalie from trying to make a save, i would be embarrassed. Just because it is technically part of the game doesnt mean its not unfair.

I never do it. I also dont care about winning nearly as much as the rocket league community i have discovered. I just want to have fun and those types of plays zap the fun right out if the game


Demo is a skill that most people don't understand and just be toxic


What’s the replay got to do with the actual goal


I usually don't get mad if someone happens to demo me or demo me so their teammate can score a goal. 

But. If I see someone repetitively going for multiple demos and chooses to ignore the ball, even driving right past it, I can get annoyed. It's like they're not trying to play car soccer but Mad Max or some shit instead. 

I try not to get toxic but if I do I just send multiple: Wow!


well, they certainly cause reactions, which is expected because getting demoed makes you completely unable to do anything for a brief moment, and people get frustrated because of it. 

last night I had a tournament final where I was demoing and when we lost the other team started flaming what a saves. Kinda infuriating ngl but it does have a mental hit to it that can be used to your advantage if you know how to do it. It's one of those """cheap tricks""" that are commonly hated but are still part of the game, like shotguns in shooters for example. Doing them certainly tests the mental game of the players involved, it might make them angry and more motivated to beat you, at which case prepare for quick chat if you end up losing. But also can make them blinded by rage and fucking up rotation to chase you, lashing out on their own teammates, and other self-destructive behaviour that can make it easier for you to win, especially since angry players quit more easily while a normal player will probably stick it out more.

Tbf I refrain from demoing in casual because I don't care about winning and I don't want to turn the match into a sweaty quickchat shitshow, but in ranked and tournaments its all fair game


I wouldn't say demo goals are toxic. I have no problem with being demo'ed on a play. But especially in 2's n 3's alot more then 1's when you have one player who ignores the game and just chases people around not even in rotation its pretty annoying.


This is Rocket League!


This is war. Outside of rule 1 bumper to bumper there are no rules.


I was boosting the ball to the goal and I demoed a guy on accident because he jumped into my path, I then was ridiculed for the rest of the game because “I couldn’t make a goal without making a demo.”


They do burn


Is demoing in anyway cheating? No. I don’t get why people get so mad about a legitimate rule in the game. Yet no one complains about rule 1s


No, people who complain about it dont know how to dodge demos. It makes someone feel real dumb when they scored on for missing a bump. The fun starts when you know people will jump out of the way to avoid the demo so you jump with them lol.


I'm C3/Gc1 and I'll Wow! Wow! Wow! My opponent any day in 1s when Demo'd


Only toxic if you are the victim


I've only ever played 1v1 and honestly, I hate demo-ing. Personally I wouldn't do it, I'd prefer to just play the ball and score by taking a good shot rather than the equivalent of knocking the controller out of your opponent's hands. I've read a bunch of comments about demo-ing being part of the game, please don't make me read more, I get it, I just don't like it and don't respect it. I don't ever play ranked, I mostly play for fun. Getting demo'd is not fun. Let's just play the ball ffs. If you wanna beat me then out-skill me (I'm not particularly good), don't use a rubbish tactic to stop me from playing. If I wanted that kind of game I would play rumble.


Not a fan of them, because the game is supposed to be like soccer, and injuring a player gets you removed from the game in soccer. Also it's kinda underhanded in 1v1 to intentionally demo repeatedly.

But should you rage over it? That's toxic.


In 2s and 3s in at the level where it's pretty well understood that demos are a mechanic, but I havent played ranked 1s in so long that I was down in plat and not even thinking about it, saw the opportunity and took it then got "Okay." spammed at me for the rest of the game. Dude didn't even try to dodge, just sat staring at the ball over his head repeatedly, I can't just not demo in that situation, especially if I don't have to worry about overcommitting and screwing my teammates


I remember winning a game by a bump/demo play in ranked 2s or 3s idk was a couple months back but all I can say is the other team was definitely not happy...


I mean it’s not really toxic, to me it’s just kinda annoying especially in 1’s.


Demo goals are only toxic when you’re around 4goals ahead of the other team. (That’s for 1s) now for 2s, if the only goal you’re capable of scoring is a demo/bump play, it’s highly annoying, especially if it’s all you do. For 3s, it’s just the gameplay. Every goal will have happened because of a bump or demo once you’re a higher rank. 

TLDR: yes but no.


No. I'm surprised anyone in the top of platinum is complaining about it. I thought I remembered that attitude ending in gold.


gotta keep your head up and be aware of who’s around you


i don’t really think it’s toxic, i just think it’s sort of rude in 1v1 when you’re being targeted the whole game. if that makes sense. yeah it is a mechanic of the game, however trying to play an entire 1v1 game trying to avoid someone that is trying to demo you the whole time is quite annoying. in 2v2 or 3v3 it’s not toxic at all, your teammates SHOULD be there to recover the ball.


I think for low(er) ranked players nearly every type of demo is toxic.


Idk in 1’s they’re a little lame but it is what it is.


Those goal are more then fair 😘


Yes


Repetitive spawn demos are toxic but that demo was fine.  I personally prefer my opponent hit the ball in, instead of letting it roll in slowly but if you want to flaunt, you do you.


Nice T rex.


In 1s no


Only if you keep doing it without purpose.


Score that goal by any means necessary!!


If it wasn’t supposed to be used it wouldn’t be in the game smh some people i play against get proper toxic after a demo lol


Demos are not toxic.  People take them way too personally.  It's a core mechanic of the game.  

Can it be annoying to get demo'd a lot?  Sure!  At the end of the day, if someone is using demos and it's working on you, the only person you can blame is yourself.  Learn to expect them and avoid them and learn to use them effectively yourself.  If someone is chasing for demos and putting themselves out of position, instead of crying about it, take advantage of the situation.


No and anyone who says otherwise is fucking soft.


It's not toxic by any means. It may be disrespectful if you demo and let it roll in slowly or intentionally spawn kill and get 3 or 4 demos in a row before scoring, but in general nah


Nah it's not toxic but It's a more competitive way of playing


It's a part of the game, it's annoying but it's a part of the game


I get so much hate when I go for demos and get called try hard a lot and they tell me to play ranked, but then they drive every lame ball Into the net when they have the chance lol


I find chat reactions to it more toxic/annoying than the actual demo. It’s a done thing, why cry about it?


Nah he was salty he was losing.


I like to run at them and brake to make them jump. Then lightly tap into them to move them out of the way. It lets them know my intentions without being forceful. It's more PC.


I chase for demos all game long, i mean like jt's fun and effective so...


Made up rules about how a game should be played solely to benefit oneself should be dismissed.

I grew up playing games with a mentality like that player in your clip... having unreasonable expectations of others.


I don’t get annoyed by demo goals, but pointless demos really make me mad. Like if I get demoed for no reason, I could just be moving up the field, no where close to being near the ball and I get blown up, or if the person misses the goal after demoing me while I was in goal.


No


If your rank on here is right and you're P3 then your opponent will 100% get mad. Mainly because they know it's  an easy goal seeming they don't know how to get to the ball of respawn fast enough or maybe they just can't process it all fast enough once they spawn. When you get higher in the ranks you'll find some players that have such good defensive mechanics that sometimes it's the only way to get past them and in those time they won't get made. It's just another play at that level, same as a flick or fake


I guess you could MAYBE make an argument for it being toxic in 1v1 but otherwise absolutely not.  More demos the better.


In casual i think yes, when people are try harding in casual and chasing all the way just to demo you i find it toxic. If you want to really try hard go in comp, i'm trying to play chill.


No, part of the game


Depends on how many times you do it in one game


It’s not toxic, letting it slowly roll into the net is a little toxic but funny


One-two properly timed demos to gain an advantage or turn the game around - all good.

Going for demo adventure just to be annoying, and forcing other players to avoid demos, which will inevitably lead to goal - toxic.

Spawn-demo players who post their "funny" demos here to show how good they are - idiots, who should not be allowed to play in ranked games.

&nbsp;

Change my mind.


Used in moderation it's fine and an accepted mechanic. Exclusively gunning for demos is just stupid and asking to get shit on.


Yes. MY opinion though. You ain’t wrong for it, but I definitely be laughing anytime someone does it to me. Lol. I always put “that’s needed? Okay” in chat. I just personally can’t get into demos lol. Maybe why I’m stuck in diamond


No. It’s a mechanic in the game for a reason if they didn’t want you to demo then it wouldn’t be possible. A lot of low ranks (me being only gold 3) find it super toxic and “unfair” but it’s purely strategy and you see bumping and demos a lot more as you climb in the ranks. All this being said, if anyone is just purely going for demos to troll then yeah I’d say pretty toxic.


I felt so bad, I actually did a double demo on the other team in 2s the other day. I didn't mean to do either one but it just lined up after me taking a high shot and missing. My teammate did score the open net. I don't chase demos but I will do it if the opportunity arises.


They can be annoying but not toxic. I don't think there's a single person in the high ranks that hasn't spawned on the wrong side after a demo. I'm also biased bc I almost have 30k demos


Nah it’s a mechanic that’s in the game. Not toxic at all. Thing is in that situation I’d just hit the ball into the goal instead of letting it roll in as that does seem a little douchey to some. I can imagine seeing that as a “hahahaha you can’t do anything about this goal anymore, let me stretch is as long as possible” kinda thing. I’d personally not care that much tho.


I absolutely do not think demo/ bump goals are toxic. It's a part of the game and should be used, however, a lot of people seem to think it's cheap. I bet some people will think walking it in was toxic, but you were probably just taking a couple extra seconds off the clock. In a game where every second counts, I say well played.


you send a "what a save", so you r toxic


The only truly toxic gameplay is switching sides because of an actual or perceived mistake from a teammate or because of the score. Everything else, including repeated demos, is legitimate


sounds like a you problem tbh, poison only works on those who drink it


Yes they are toxic as people tend to prefer someone best then mechanically. 

That being said, it's a part of the game... so it's really not.


Well he had just joined damn😂😂


There's a simple solution that works like a charm: you need to go into the settings and change the chat to Team Only.


I understand it being frustrating if someone is just going for demos the whole time but I've never been the type that gets tilted from the well timed demo


They're not. It's people getting stressed about the fact that they can't do anything to stop you from scoring, they don't know how to deal with that stress and they spam "wow" like "wow, you're a piece of shit" but really it just shows their immaturity.


No.


Demo is hockey technique. It’s called checking. It’s a legitimate strategy and a way to shut down scorers


How exactly do demos work? Because like, I've been going roughly the same speed as an opponent in the same direction before, and it almost seems like they can side-swipe me and I'll blow up sometimes? That's when I get frustrated, cause I don't understand how that works. 

Also when someone on the other team just demo chases the whole round. I mean, I know enough to avoid them most of the time, it's just annoying.


No but they really tilt some people


Well timed demos and bumps are a useful tactic that’s available to everyone. When I get bumped or demoed out of an opportunity to score or make a save, I make note of what they did to both avoid it in the future, and use it myself. Anyone that complains about it is prob the same type that thinks the game is cheating when they die in crash bandicoot


No, it's a mechanic that everyone can use. Just people don't know how to deal with demos and they get upset and call it toxic.


There are no toxic moves, only toxic people.


Bro demo goals are freaking life. 

A well timed demo can be an INCREDIBLY useful and skilled tactic to get the ball where it needs to be


I'm in bottom gold top silver rn and we compliment a nice demo. Demos can be a game changer.


Disrespectful... yes, toxic?.. no


If you execute them like that yes but if you actually try to get the goal (not sitting still) then it’s just annoying


Nah that guy’s just a chump


I don’t think they are toxic, depending on how you get the demo, but I do think demos are broken. The amount of times I get demoed with it being warranted is crazy. Meanwhile I ram into somebody full speed and it’s like a love tap. Demos used to be so much more consistent. I feel like it’s almost rng now


No.  Keep up the demoing.


Bronze-Champ this is somehow considered disrespect, anything higher it’s simply just a mechanic


If you are below champ people are mad about it


Am I the only one mind fucked with the fact that thats a demo. This is the main reason I hate this game he wasnt even close to him.


I’ve always said this. Adding demos was a conscious thought on the part of the devs so that it could be used as part of game play. So what if you’re bigmad you got demoed and they scored. Do it back. It’s there for everyone.


I only get mad at demos if people are going for goalie demos right out of the gate. If you ignore the face off to demo a goalie 4 seconds in you're a jerk


No it’s part of the game. Demo and demo avoidance is a skill


I honestly hate people getting toxic , spamming thanks or just calling you out for demos , it's a mechanic .. it's like i shot the ball and it went in then you tell me that i'm toxic for scoring


Don't hate the player, hate the game. It's not toxic, it's literally a part of the game. Nobody complains in hockey when a player gets checked and the puck gets stolen because it's a part of the game (unless it was illegal check of course)


Salty Wow!s only make me stronger...


Yes


it is if you do it in casuals


I got matched up against someone who reported me after demiong him once and then he started being toxic. Champ 1 btw


Not so sure about this - play at C3/GC (doubles) and still get people that complain massively about demo. Never understood why, it's mechanic in the game and perfectly good option.


Yeah but I had a similar experience but the catch is in a doubles match one of the opponent was going around demo both me and my teammate while his other team stayed in the goal. They didn't even tried to fucking score. We won the game tho 😌😂


You'd be surprised.


What level? People still whine about bumps at D3


It's also WAY better than the alternative of getting launched into space


I was in a Champ 3 1v1 match and the dude got pissed I demoed him when he was a sitting duck on the back wall. He claimed I didn't respect him enough to save it lol.


The only time I call out demos is when a player drops and one team is short handed. Like you already have a competitive advantage of 3 vs 2 and you're going to try demoing them? That's just unsportsmanlike.


Maybe ... There's always a fine line though. I'm C3 and you still occasionally get some moron who constantly goes for demos.
Normally it's easy to counter, but if the server is acting up a bit or even just high ping it becomes a nightmare to avoid those people 


They do kind of annoy me in game but I try and show it by destroying them, not by leaving


>When you reach a certain level people don't cry about it as much because they seem to understand that it's one of the mechanics to use to better your game. People that do cry about being demo'd kind of show their own level without understanding it.

Must be top of GC or something because I get toxic people after demos all through C1 to low GC.


It creates some really interesting play mechanics.  Especially when people are crowding the goal.  There is some risk reward where I’d you go for the demo but they jump or dodge you usually end up out of position with them still in goal, though if you time it right it can mean even if they jump they’re still in the air when your teammate takes the shot which can make it hard to block.


Guilty. I’m sure it’s 50% of the reason I’m still diamond 3 lol


[deleted]


I feel you, I once had some punk cry to me cuz I demo’ed him like 3 times, though in my defense it was like anywhere I went he was just there so there goes that. We did win the match and the demo’s definitely helped quite a lot. Later he messaged crying about it and I’m like “bro, it’s not like I hacked the game to add this or I created it. It’s part of the game.”


I’m level 1853 and constantly rank at C3 I hate demoing. I don’t get mad anymore but I hate it. Like demoing a person about to shoot? Coolio no big deal. Demoing a goalie? That doesn’t deserve any praise as you didn’t technically score more so that they just didn’t block. That’s my 2 cents on it anyway  I’ve been playing since 2016 and seen a lot of demos.


Exactly! I spent a lot of time learning to predict and anticipate player movement and how to manipulate the game state to my advantage, rather than ceiling-shot-triple-flip-reset redirect Musty shots. 

Also, learning how to do it also taught me how to *avoid* it.


I’m champ 2 and I still find it quite annoying. I would much rather get beat by someone’s mechanic skills than a cheap demo.


This might be showing my rank, but here goes anyway.

This particular clip I would be fine with, because it's pretty evident that OP was using this as a strategy to score a goal. Tactical demos I am A-Ok with, even if they feel in the moment like a really cheap shot.

What I *don't* like and really starts to grate on me is when any opponent starts to only go for demos when I'm trying to play a game of goddamned soccar. Leave me alone please? Hit the ball, maybe?

I dunno, I love playing the game but when I'm constantly trying to avoid getting blown up it makes it really hard to focus on actually playing. I get tilted, but more of an "I'm done playing the game now because it isn't fun anymore" instead of "that fucking top bar keeps blocking every single shot and now we're losing and I'm pissed off"

Trolls are gonna troll and balls are still gonna roll.


Tell that to scrub and the other pros who complain about it all the time


[removed]


Yeah, demo’s aren’t toxic. 

The people who get mad about using a built in game mechanic are toxic.


Also strategically it's better to waste as much time as possible since you're up two goals. Why shoot immediately? That only helps them


> They reacted how they did probably partially because of how you slowed down instead of shooting.

if you are in front that's also a valid strategy to take a few seconds off the clock...


Oh I love doing that shit.


>They reacted how they did probably partially because of how you slowed down instead of shooting.

Oh man, that shit is so cocky and smarmy. Just really unnecessarily douchey.


I mean personally, aside from actually shit talking in chat, I will try to make my 1s opponents tilt as much as possible simply by how I play. Mind games are a very viable strat for gaining momentum in 1s.


demos are part of the game. if people don't like it, there's a great game called The Sims.


agreed, removing a player off the pitch for an advantage is a-ok in my book, but spawn demoing requires you to break rotation and spend boost killing a player that will only exist on the pitch for .01 seconds and won't change anything. at that point it's mostly a mental tactic to try to tilt the other team, thats as far as it goes in terms of helping you win.


I only find demos kind of toxic in the heat seaker game mode bc they’re really effective and not very fun.


If it is part of the game and it helps me win that game. I will use whatever tactics I think will work best to beat my opponents.

I don’t often spawn demo because it’s bad play in general, but if I see an opportunity to help me win, I’ll take it


Ya that’s the only part of demoing i consider to be a little toxic. Like you have no control over what side you spawn on when respawning and then you just immediately die again and can’t play the game.

Like i guess it’s a reward for guessing correctly what side someone is going to spawn on but it stills sucks that it’s a thing.


I’m giggling now just thinking about it


It’s one of my favorite ways to score lol. It’s funny to see how people get so mad when you are only up by 1 or 2.


These kind of demos are a solid play and a part of the game. BUT there are strategic demos and demos just to be an asshole. The way I classify asshole demos is if it doesn’t in any way contribute to an immediate goal, that’s when I get peeved. C1/C2 is my rank.


When they start trying to demo you, it's soooo funny, because you can tell they're 110% full tilt, and don't have a chance of actually doing anything because of their blind rage. 

I seriously don't get what it is about demos that make some people absolutely go fucking insane.


Only if that overpowered gun is extremely hard to use properly. I find it more like ganondorf in Smash where he can absolutely clown you with his Dair, but it’s so easy to dodge.


I agree. it’s frustrating but not worthy of a ragequit lol


I only said “what a save” after he left 😂


When you are up 3 - 1 it’s a strategy to slow down your goal to kill a little bit of time. It may look like gloating but in reality it’s just helping your chance of winning by a small margin


What about the ones that try demoing the goalie and constantly miss when the goalie jumps


What am I supposed to do then when someone swings out of nowhere from beyond my view and just repeatedly demos me, even when I am not in goal or pushing up the ball?


> but repeatedly fail because they haven't learned that you can single jump to avoid them pretty easily.

Or because they telegraph their demos and don't try to sneak up on you from behind/the sides. Or (in a 2v2/3v3) they totally abandon rotation to chase me, leaving their teammate in a bad spot where it's super easy for us to score.

I don't claim to be amazingly skilled myself, but people who call me trash for bumping too much don't often appreciate that there is *some* skill involved in my playstyle, even if it's not the skills they're used to.


Yeah. Demo goals are definitely not toxic, but I understand why they're higher on the "feelsbadman" scale of the game. Like you, I love using this to my advantage. Call me a bully, but once I can sense the other person is on tilt I will 100% push that. I'm not gonna throw a game going for it, but if I have space I'll definitely take the demo option more often. And if they start the toxic quick chat? Oh boy. Again, I'm not gonna start it myself cause I'm not an asshole like that, but if that's the game they want to play I'm more than happy to step.


🤷🏼‍♂️


If they're scoring on you/winning against you, it's not a crutch, it's a playstyle. I haven't practiced aerials much myself, but I make up for it with my bumping. I think my mechanics are low plat at best, but I've had times where I've almost pushed into champ because of how effective my bumps are, despite being pretty terrible at other stuff.

Also - bump heavy playstyles can benefit from weird rotations. Hanging further up the pitch puts you nearer the opponents, so you can remove the defence when your team's on offence, and disrupt shots before they happen when your team's on defence.


haha 🤫. it’s a good name what can i say?


When you do something to make someone else mad for the sake of just making them mad then yes that is toxic


Lmao me hitting What a Save! Is toxic and a mechanic of the game. But I see what your saying tho lol


i chatted what a save after he rage quit


hahaha the best advice is always in the comments


Idk I would take someone dedicating all their time to trying to demo me. Easy W


every time 👍


Nah, bleeding time while you're ahead is a valid strat.


Spamming What a save! Is toxic but also a part of the game. This take Aint it


haha oops


Same, as long as a demo actually helps them, I really don't mind

Assholes who aren't even trying to play and just want to troll in ranked can fuck off, though.


It’s hard to pull of effectively and incredibly risky


How do they know you’re a girl? Cars have no gender


I go for anyone who reacts - partly cos I get a kick out of it, partly cos the more tilted a player gets, the less effective they become. Also I often prioritise PC players cos Psynets can only quickchat their rage, which is much less satisfying. But as for targeting a particular gender or other demographic - not at all.


a purely female take - esports should have female leagues just like real sports.


Which is why I don’t go for demo goals that often, but when I do it feels so good.


Well when your going for demo goals in viable situations it's better in my opinion I'm diamond 2 and so far I have reported a few toxic baby's over it and they got banned lol they've said horrible things but yeah it works but I don't go for them all the time just when I know there's an opening to score


No, you're making a bad argument. You say that demoing is for the lesser skilled by strawmanning those who only demo.

 Adding demos to your arsenal only makes you a better player.


I'm so glad I'm not alone in feeling that way lol So unnecessary.


Spawn camping in shooting games, I rest my case


i only what a saved them after they left the match lol.


How is eliminating a goalie irl comparable to a mechanic in RL?


after he left the match tho lol


I recently had someone on my team that I accidentally bumped, I apologized and he just started trolling and shooting the ball into our own net and said “well if you wanna troll, I’ll troll too!”. I was so genuinely confused.


🤦🤦🤦🤦


At my level, it’s just frustrating when they always go for demo’s and not actually play the game. It doesn’t matter if they’re losing and my teammate is constantly scoring. Sure, when it’s used as sort of advanced bump, it’s respectable, but it’s kind of tilting being blown up seconds after you spawn.


I feel you bro. Rocket league has to be the most toxic game I've ever played (psyonix are not completely innocent themselves with the swearing quick chat) but it's so toxic that when I play against a non toxic person, I congratulate them on not being toxic whether I win or lose.


I’m GC 1 and people still cry about demos


You’re still below that certain level. Champ 1 is the new Diamond 2


You're higher level than me bro, so you'd know better. I just assumed at that level everyone is using tactical bumps and demo's when needed.


I’ve had people demo… as a defensive strategy. And I found it awesome and revealing and something my team then needed to avoid. 

It was wild.


Definitely in 1s it's a legitimate Strat at about c1 and people don't get mad


It goes away quicker in 3s than in 2s. In 3s we pretty consistently both bump and get bumped as the front man rotates out. 

2s I don’t get a lot of flak for bumping but if it works more than once it’s pretty tilting. If the other team bumps it’s usually a decent play so I respect it lol


It's annoying


Most I usually get is a Wow! at d3/c1. In gold I used to get like essays lol


Hey if people are still playing to win, why is it unsportsmanlike?


It's only annoying in the sense of "god damnit, I should have avoided that"


As you said, It's part of the game and I couldn't agree more. 

He has to learn and move on.


Why doesn't it deserve praise? Better players will dodge and avoid demos, so it's not exactly easy. And you still technically scored, why is demo such an "invalid" mechanic? Maybe flip resets shouldn't count as well, as they were sort of unintended consequence of the game physics.


Demos are a mechanical skill, friend. It's hard to demo someone who is actively trying to dodge.


But what if, you have a good kickoff. Then follow it with a team mate who demos the goalie. 

That’s strategy.


Why don't you beat them with your mechanical skill by dodging the demo? People like to pretend that demo'ing isn't a skill like any other.

Whenever I'm on the bad end of a demo I consider it a failure of either my game sense for not anticipating it or my mechanics for not breaking/jumping/whatever.


But like, I feel like if they just demo chase, just slow down and beat them easily. It sucks, but people will never always play the game it's meant to be played. No sense to feeding into this bully behavior. Destroy them for playing like an idiot and go next.


You have to take someone's character into account. Scrub complains about almost everything he does that others do. He's also said many times in his vids how to use demo's and bumps to your advantage.
Also, I said the higher the ranks go the less people complain about them because as you probably know, they are used a lot at the top ranks when needed and not just for shoots and giggles.


You're saying it's not true that the higher your level gets the more you/people understand how to use bumps and demo's to your/their advantage, therefore don't complain as much as lesser ranks?


I saw a clip recently of a chick streaming COD and the guys she was owning were complaining that she was \*jumpshotting\* so just jumping then shooting. People blame in-game mechanics because either they can't do it well or they're just salty they lost.


"Is lead blocking toxic? Football would be more fair if the offense wouldn't make it so hard to tackle the ball carrier."


tbf whenever someone reacts in chat to me demoing them i make sure to demo them more and use the sorry! quickchat everytime, I do consider that toxic but one of the great tactical advantages of a demo is tilting the opponent anyway so why not crank it up a bit


Though is it toxic to constantly demo a person?


Its a toxic mechanic but i dont see the ones using it as being toxic.

I just wished it wasnt a thing that you explode.


[deleted]


Smashing it in fast just gives the opponent more time to catch up. If I'm up by a few goals you can be sure I'm gonna slow roll them whenever possible to run the clock down.

It's not toxic, it's just smart play.


You can do much worse things in the Sims tbh


😂😂😂😂


If that's a problem then psyonix should add smth to prevent it, like making u invincible for a couple of sec or smth after spawn. Like if smth is an abusable mechanic in game, then it shouldn't really be on the players to avoid it imo. Even tho it might be toxic


6 seconds of repawn timer although you're pretty much out of the play for that amount of time too


yeah - usually a demo is high risk high reward since you need to be fully committed to hit the opponent and less committed to the ball most of the time - and if you miss the demo you're often in a pretty bad spot and have also wasted a big amount of boost.

In Heatseeker those things don't matter at all since it doesn't matter if you are out of position as long as your teammate is in goal and boost literally doesn't matter.

It's just 100% easymode in this gamemode as everything making it risky and a move to be used strategically is removed there


It's just generally annoying when it's 6-0 and then they turn to tactical bumps/demos as if that they planned to do so for clips


It still surprises me when people act this way.  I mean, it truly is just a part of the game.  As much as it sucks when you’re the one getting demoed, I respect a good demo :p


All demos that don’t put your team at a disadvantage are strategic.


If you get tilted than the demo was strategic and worked. Any time there's a natural opportunity for a demo, I'll do it.


The non-strategic ones (chasing me around the map literally the entire time for no reason at all) just hurt their team and help my team though, so I don't even mind those that much.


Was it the first one, because if I’m in a game where I keep getting demo-goaled I’m gonna rage quit because it’s gonna be a game where my defense doesn’t matter just my ability to dodge you does and that’s boring for the whole match.


I always get frustrated by demo goals, but from the perspective of "damn I can't believe I didn't avoid that." Like I just get annoyed at myself for allowing demo goals but getting mad at the person who demoed you is whiny


Still. Implies that you are that type who spams "What a save!" when you score a very mediocre goal. To answer your question, no demos are not toxic, but someone who is so unsure of that that they post it to Reddit for validation and forgot that they used "What a save!" quick chat to a dude that's already left probably is a bit immature and toxic. Less than three


I feel like this is used as an excuse more than it’s used as a tactic.


Still a success, imo. Goalie may be out of position, and it's now on their skill level to get back to the ground, or fly to where the ball is by pulling a rabbit out of their hat to make that save with a well-aimed shot.

Now if there's no shot incoming, and the goalie can reposition, then it was a bit wasted, but you also got them going "alright, I should be jumping around this guy" and you've added an element that they need to be prepared for.


Take advantage of the fact they're not interested in defending their goal or challenging the ball.

Use audio cues to hear a car is coming near you fast.  Don't be predictable with your car movements, drift, change direction, keep moving. 

I don't think I've ever been happy about a teammate exclusively chasing demos because it leaves me completely exposed, having to do the actual attacking and defending alone.

Exploit the huge gaps those demo chasers leave, it's very rarely an effective strategy, if it was, pros would be doing it.


Sometimes they win, most of the time they don’t. Still wildly annoying for me, who puts hours into training and grinding, to go up against someone who always speed kicks off but misses the ball, over commits to every shot, ball chases, doesn’t know hot to rotate with teams, but acts like they’re the shit when they demo goal you. 

I know they only got there from demo goaling their way thru silver and gold. They don’t deserve to be there.


It is, I originally thought this was scored in a game with me, but saw no 3 and it clicked XD

Nice goal tho, people who whine about demos deserve nothing but to be demo goaled on

Mine's spelled the same way as well, two Vs and everything


But my point is, they are getting mad because of the core mechanic in the game. I dont care if someone demo me, I dont care if someone spam "What a Save!", I'll just score more goals, if it was a bad thing it wouldnt be in a game. Its a competetive game, every advantage you can get over your enemy, even being a mental one is good thing. If you are here for fun, play casual, if you want to win, use everything at your disposal to do so in competetive mode. 

If you get mad at stuff like these, your mind is not at the right place, and it can and should be used against you.


You can mute "What a Save!" but you can't mute a demo!


Wouldn’t describe quick chat as a mechanic imo


What about letting the ball trickle in? Super unnecessary.


The chat is not part of playing the game. Btw, u can also mute it so


i was dumb enough to put my name in my psn username


Why have split leagues? They should just be able to compete in the same league since there's not really any advantage or disadvantage to gender in esports.


That would be a step backwards IMO. Finally we have a level playing field where gender or physical differences are not a determinant factor. 

In this case the trigger for suggesting segregation is that male players can be toxic to female players, which I won’t deny is an issue. But there are better ways to deal with it. 

We don’t deal with racism in eSports by making a whites-only league. This is a toxic male problem; harassment of women in and out of the game should be dealt with accordingly.


> by strawmanning those who only demo.

Not just that - if you *do* actually have good demo skills (relative to  your rank), it doesn't matter whether you still rotate, or if you hardly go for the ball at all.

My brother and I often get pretty big winstreaks whenever I'm on top form with my bumps, but of course the moment we finally lose a game, the opponents never fail to tell me how useless my playstyle is.  
All they've seen is the single match where it hasn't worked out so well (and/or they're still a little bit tilted, even though they won) so they let me know all about how I'm letting my team down/how it's karma that I lost :D


If we are talking specifically about demoing a person playing goalie at that moment in order to have a wide open net, how is that not the same thing as instantly eliminating a goalie on a soccer field as someone is attempting to score. Its exactly the same thing.

Whether or not it is allowed doesnt change exactly what it is.


How is it not?


You never know what the person's last teammate was like.  After spending 5 minutes game time with someone completely miserable, I have to continually remind myself in the next game that they are a completely different little car that I am playing with.


Was prolly me. Anytime someone ball chases or bumps me more than once, it’s over.


Yeah...


I agree with you here. Used as a strategic maneuver is all well and good, but just going for demos all game just gets tiring/irritating.


Just like with people who can’t do the fast kickoff but still try, or can’t perform an aerial but keep trying, the people who are practicing demoing are steadily increasing their skill level by trying to murder every car they see, and it is improving their gameplay to the detriment of their current teammates.

 It’s just like learning any other skill, but it doesn’t feel that way because when they go for a demo it may be a poor strategic choice.


In casual I got matched with a lower-ranked guy who didn't know the "left goes" rule for equidistant kickoffs so I politely and constructively informed him that "at higher levels, when you and a teammate are equal distance from the ball on kickoff, the person on the left typically goes for it while the other gets boost". His response was "Could you be more toxic please? I'm not used to this constructive criticism". Made me laugh.


Wait till you try League of Legends.


In my experience RL can def be toxic, but the most toxic playerbase in a game I’ve ever experienced is rust lol. Also felt that with having a non-toxic game, kudos to ops for being decent people. Even better when you end up having a solid convo with them as well


I shut off comments from opposing team. Can't tell you how much it helped my game. I don't care what they are complaining about because I can';t see it.


You've never played league of legends hahaha rocket League is so tame


Just turn off chat bud, sounds like you might need it.


Rocket League is basically 4-H compared to a MOBA like DOTA.


Maybe that you've played, but I find that almost all games have the same level of toxicity. Like overwatch was painful 60% of the time. Cod is built on the fact that you can rage and yell at anyone in your lobby. I haven't played it but LoL has the best reviews for the worst people in it community. 
I think it's the same level all round. Its probably just how much the otherdude can affect you game that determines how much of it you see, as well as how much the game means to you


FACTS


Or when they make a weekly challenge "use what a save 3 times"

This week it's like the opposite.


Yeah you haven't played a moba like league of legends or Dota then. My buddy and I play rocket league because it's less toxic. Quick chats aren't really that bad compared to literal voice acted shit talking chat wheel lines you can buy on top of the normal quick chats. Or the fact that you are locked into an HOUR long match. You get a smurf or someone leaves match? Cool 1hr+ of misery. 

Also people are 10x worse because no one understands why they are losing. Sure, don't always in rocket league either, there's a reason low ranks be low, but a game like Dota is so long and complex that people in lower ranks won't understand AT ALL. Like have absolutely clue what is leading to a lose condition and blame it on teammates or other factors. 

In rocket league if your behind you need to score a goal, if your ahead you need to not get scored on. Everything between can be complicated but it's obvious what needs to be done. Dota who fuckin knows, you probably missed an opportunity 4 creeps 10 times 20 min ago making you get killed by 1hp and now the entire game from here is a downward slope.


RL toxicity is nothing compared to Rust.


[deleted]


I'm GC.

Do some people rely heavily on bumps and demos to win? Yes.

Is it a valid, viable playstyle? Yes.

Is it annoying sometimes? Still yes.

Do I cry about it in chat? No. 

Even pros get annoyed by this playstyle from time to time. The key is to keep a level head despite the annoyance. Half the reason people do it is to tilt, and if you are tilted you make mistakes.


Sorry - never meant it to come across that I'm higher or anything like that at all. Just in my experience those that get salty over humps seem to appear at all levels lol. 

Not going to lie though, I do love a demo goal!


I LOVE when I'm behind the play and the other team is making a pass in front of my net and I demo the guy who the ball is going to. One of the best feelings in this game for me.


I get that you lose control for a moment, but is that really any more annoying than watching your opponent spend 30s trying to air-dribble off the wall every time they touch the ball?

I can avoid demos (mostly). I can't stop people from taking an eternity to set up an ineffective attack.


My buddies and I rotate "pitbull" in those situations lol. Play it as a twos match with someone going full demo troll. Sorry not sorry, comp is for Ws. 

If you wanna be mad, be mad at the quitter that cost you the game


I'm not sure you understand what what word means.

It certainly doesn't mean "win at any cost" or taking advantage of every situation.

Generally speaking - it's being fair and recognizing the spirit of the game. In the context of RL if the other team is down a player I'll usually hang back and let my teammates be the offensive. Assuming we are up.

Yes. We still have the advantage but it's not kicking them when they're down.


Exactly. I go for demos with a man advantage, but only if we're not winning. Once you're in the lead it becomes a bit overkill and toxic then, IMO.


I'm not saying don't play to win. If the team doesn't ff and you keep scoring goals, by all means take advantage of that. But to see you already have an advantage and decide, let make it more unfair by demoing. It's cheap and reeks of low skill in my opinion.


Squishy and ayyjay are always calm and they clearly don't like it either. Apparentlyjack too maybe, don't watch him enough to remember.


I saw that clip.  Yeah, that had nothing to do with her "abusing" mechanics.  She also killed them straight up standing in the open because she was just better than they were.

(Not directed at you, just pointing out that complaints like that against women are incredibly common and have nothing to do with the game, usually.)


Not always. Some games have flaws and some communities look down upon players abusing those flaws. Personally I think RL doesn't have any problems like this but clearly some think demoing is a bad game mechanic.


“Sorry!

Oops!

Bumping!”


If you're playing hockey, is it toxic to constantly finish your checks?


No. Why would it be? At that point Is it toxic to constantly score on someone?


If you are going after them, I think so(spawn demos). But if it just happens or they get in a place where it’s strategic to do so then sure why not.


It is not funny to piss other people off.


It's the most toxic part of the clip. Funny or not.


1.	own a restaurant 
2.	serve bad pufferfish
3.	customers die immediately 
4.	take their headstones 
5.	start graveyard business


The thing is, 90% of the time I get demoed it is because I messed up big time. Why would I be pissed at the other guy when I misread a bounce, then sat still trying to figure out what to do next? I might as well get upset when my opponents know how to score open nets.


There’s a fine line between strategy and trolling.


Natural opportunity. 100% yes.


no, it doesnt... because the dude was out of the game for 5 seconds. he knew whag he was doing. i do the same thing just because its dumb but funny


>  "What a save!" quick chat to a dude that's already left probably is a bit immature and toxic.

This is like saying "wow, you muttered 'that guy's a dick' to yourself after the game. Very immature"


Bro calm down lmao. It's totally different when they leave and aren't there to see qc. I never spam toxic stuff to people when they're there, but when someone in 1s is being annoying with qc and then rage quits, I'll say gg gg gg or something. Doesn't mean I'm a toxic player, it's just for myself.


I mean if you watch any high level 1’s gameplay everyone does it. It’s absolutely a well known strategy in the 1’s community


> you also got them going "alright, I should be jumping around this guy" and you've added an element that they need to be prepared for.

Yep :D I equip the Civet engine noise (sounds like tortured cats). Maybe I don't get quite so many demos because the opponents hear me coming, but as long as they're using half their focus trying to listen out for my engine noise, I don't even *need* to bump them to be effective.


> Sometimes they win, most of the time they don’t.

My rank's been pretty stable for a while (I'm not really trying to climb anymore, just play for fun) so I win pretty much exactly 50% of my games, over all. If your statement were true, then all of the players who used demo-heavy styles would never leave bronze.

> I know they only got there from demo goaling their way thru silver and gold. 

You know how ranking up works? In order to rank up, you generally need to win more games than you lose. If players have gotten to your rank by demoing, that means that demos are helping them to win games.


As long as they arent boosted, they deserve to be there, demoing 99% of the match and winning is still a legit strategy, its also super easy to play against if they focus on it too much


exactly


it is a tool that can be used to your advantage or disadvantage


When you're in the lead, timewasting is a legit tactic. Definitely can come off as BM but that doesn't mean it's unnecessary.


I used to play on my girlfriends Xbox and she put her full name as her gamer tag 💀 I would always get friend requests and invites and weird messages


Lol ah I see. I guess that’ll do it. Sucks that anyone would decide to be toxic because of that though


[This user](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/p3kaji/alpine_esports_announces_alpine_white_female/h8stoql/?context=3) explains why pretty well. Tagging /u/stupidusername6900 so they can see.


very obviously gender differences extend into the mind.


Males are toxic, if that's what you want to label it. when two men compete, it can get heated (or toxic). This is true of MMA and Rocket League. Gender differences extend into the mind. women do not, generally, have this competitive spirit for a multitude of reasons, but primarily how they socialize themselves within their own peer groups.

You COULD separate leagues by race, there's no doubt that most Asians and Whites can't compete on the basketball court. But generally society is against classifying certain men as physically weaker than one another on a genetic level, because this opens up an obvious can of intellectual worms that usually bricks the commoner's brain with worries of racism.

Male players SHOULD be able and encouraged to be just as toxic to female players as they are to men. And in my experience, when you meet a GOOD female player, they will be just as toxic as the average male player (especially true in CSGO). Females cry toxicity when they lose. There are many awesome female players who can hang. Bitches not welcome.


At high levels, you face the same people fairly regularly in a session. It’s very obnoxious to continually face or be on the same team as a toxic player game after game. I find it especially frustrating when your mutual frustration with each other grows over the course of 3-4 games and it just boils over. It may start silently because it’s just 1 bad game, then next game it’s an Okay or Wow, then next it’s just pausing and not playing after mistakes, then finally just a total shit show of griefing in game 4. Sometimes the only solution is to take a 15 mins break to break the cycle of matchmaking.


Honestly the best thing you can do is forget all the negative that's happened in the last min. That goes for you frustration levels and game play. 
I've noticed that when I'm unfazed by getting demoed, missing, getting trash talked, or just loosing, then I tend to mess up cuz I'm distracted. It's easiersaid than done but if your able to see every opportunityas it presentsitself as it presents itself, your able to react immediately. 

Also 90% of the time when people talk shit they have no idea what they're talking about. if they did they probably would be understanding mor the resentful. They'll talk about score when they've been the one holding the ball all game but can't stop themselves from handing goals over. Complain about missed saves when they haven't spent a single second on defense, or when it's a Messi shot.


Totally agree .   I'm in this boat as well. 


As for demos...  It's part of the game...I use every tool available to win, and if it gets under my opponents skin, bonus ftw 😁


~~Watch any pro 1v1 and see how they use and avoid demos. It really is just another skill one can learn and develop. If you're going to  keep letting me demo you to save goals and to make them, why wouldn't I lol.~~

Just get better lul


There's something I don't understand. Even at my level, you might have played, what, 500?, 1500? games.... How can someone not notice the pattern after that many games? 

(BTW, it seems the "left goes" rule is a NA server thing. In EU, they call out who goes every time.)


Think I'd be too scared to now, lmao.


Rust has that global chat though and it's mainly for giving death threats to whoever dared to pvp you and win. But also just racist and sexist jokes. 

It's definitely a diff kind of toxic than other games. I'll take "I'm madder and better than you" competitive chat over whatever the hell edgy things kids say in public chat from MMOs


I turn chat completely off and it's bliss


You're right I haven't and probably never will now, lmao.


Yeah, Rocket league is the least toxic competitive community I ever seen actually.


No not at all, if I do that then toxic people kind of win. I enjoy chatting with non toxic players and have met some very nice people and long term teammates just from randoms.
I also try help toxic players become non toxic...
Thanks for the advice tho bro.


That's what I have to do in d3. If only there was an option where you could choose to play against people in a match that automatically skips every replay because they do be watching EVERY REPLAY. I don't understand. Half the time they will watch every one of my replays too and I'm just like why.


> because what happens is completely out of their control

I mean it really isn't, most of the time. People just need to learn to be aware of their surroundings and use audio to their advantage. Dodging demos and bumps is also a skill worth learning and improving.


I thought everyone would feel this way but apparently not. If someone's going for unnecessary bumps and demo's they're costing themselves the game.


But then do you accidentally score on your own goal at Mach speed? This is usually my outcome.


Yes it is more annoying because atleast I'm in control if my teammate fucks up I can recover from that or atleast make adjustments but with the demo it's a complete out of game moment and a reset. And also puts my teammate in a tough position.


If you play a 2v3 out without forfeiting, you're not allowed to be upset about losing. You knew what was about to happen.


You know what reeks of low skill? Not avoiding demos.


I understand what you're saying but we know any pro player would demo someone if that was their only option to stop a goal.


Sure some are real flaws but I'm not really talking about those, rather built in mechanics that are well known.


Most people hate the demo mechanic until they realize in most cases it’s pretty easy to counter and avoid. People who complain like this are simply too shit and/or too stupid to actually play the game properly


I've only demoed when someone is in the way, and never gone out of my way to do it because it always felt like a cheap shot. But looks like the overwhelming consent is too demo away.

It's draining time off the clock. Clock management is a real part of any game with a timer.


Literally all top players do this to some extent because as /u/asleepatthewhee1 said, clock management is a real part of the game.


Forfeiting when you’re down by only two goals with 3:30 left because you’re opponent dunked on you is more toxic if you ask me.


It's hardly toxic at all. I think it's funny as hell when people do it.


Oh I had a big mansion with a large pool full of headstones where I basically made a haunted graveyard from unfortunate pool ladder disappearances.


Ah yes, the Jim Pickens approach


this sounds like most vertical business models today.


Also, dodging an attempted demo is so satisfying. Makes me feel like Frenkie de Jong vs Real Madrid


Not really. Fishing for demos without going out of position is important, and beneficial.


And sometimes just to piss of the enemy as well. If I'm lucky it's someone peeved by demoes :D


Lol samesies. The Civet engine just gets the people going!


yeah that's exactly what it's like haha


That user wants to pretend that parents were stopping young girls from playing videogames, when in reality, it's girls who choose to do other things because they are not naturally as competitive as guys (which is something women will reference as one of their main strengths over men, their ability to work together, you can't have it both ways ladies). This is further confirmed by job roles in societies that remove all boundaries to women in the workforce - they still choose to do female jobs like nursing.

Then the user wants to pretend that guys harassing them online (what guys call talking shit) prevents them from getting better, when in reality, women have test worse on spacial awareness, reflex timing, and hand eye coordination in nearly every study conducted, ever.

The user is coping. Live in truth.


You sound both racist and sexist


This sounds terrible.  I guess I am glad I suck then.


This is unbelievably true. Especially on smaller servers like OCE as opposed to NA where the high elo population is even smaller and taking a break simply does not work. As you end up versing the same people consistently for weeks or months and if you get mad at them even once you can kiss free MMR goodbye in the future.


Ngl I mainly play casual with my friends but when one of us makes an obvious mistake, rages or just plays really poorly during a match no one will let them forget it for the rest of the session and that has made me kinda immune to toxic behavior unless it’s unprovoked


People don't realize how being toxic can really lower you and your teams skill-based ability even if you're just spamming in chat. I've only been playing for about 400-600 hours (not sure the exact amount since i'm at work), and can definitely notice a massive difference in skill when absolutely heated in the game, vs when chill and relaxed. 

10/10 throw on some calming music, play the game, and just try not to give a fuck.. You'll play better.


[deleted]


Hell yeah


I think it is becoming more of a thing in EU aswell. And when called out, more often than not it's the one on the left going for it.


I'm OCE and the general rule, in my observations, is that up to around D1-D2 people call out who's going 90% of the time. D3 and up the "left goes" rule is used 90% of the time.


League of legends is easily the most toxic game I’ve played. Rocket league has nothing on it


They're probably just drinking water or something dude


But sometimes it just be like that and you own goal and get flamed by your teammates.


So it is annoying because it is effective? Do you find people that can flick well and play excellent defense to be annoying as well?


Yep. And if you win it's a pure uncut high like any other when you send the screenshot with a "thanks for bailing" to your quitter


I'd say the difficulty ramps up significantly if you're short handed. The ability to demo also gets way easier.


Yeah anyone that actually gets mad at demos I make it my personal mission to demo them tons.


Nah I've felt this way about certain mechanics in other games where things aren't balanced properly for example. It's natural to feel like that and often the problem's gonna persist because if someone feels like demoing is dirty or whatever then they won't try it themselves and find out how hard it actually is.

Edit: demoing is also used in pro play so it's not like you can that easily avoid being demo'd


Demochasing is kinda risky so most people usually just demo when the opportunity arises.

Going out of your way to chase demos will, well, get you out of your way and out of rotation quite easily.


Was hoping someone would point this out. Every second counts in car soccer. Typical in sports to play the clock.


Thank you. That is a very valid point and I will remember it next time it happens. Maybe I'll start doing it as well!


Yep, I see it in basically any JohnnyBoi 1v1 match I watch.


That's a good point and I thanked the user who pointed that out to me. Maybe I'll start using that tactic as well!


I have a highlight somewhere of one of my failed demos. Opponent dodged a challenge, and I went for a demo from behind while he was getting the ball back under control. Right as I was about to hit, he dropped the ball and jumped, allowing me to zoom under him and own goal.


Disagree. There’s a point where it becomes a nuisance and takes the fun out of the match. I don’t know about you, but I enjoy the game because it’s competitive and fun. I play both ways (looking for demos and not), but I know I’m trolling if I’m constantly looking for the demo and that’s the play style I choose for that match.


Gotcha. Thanks for proving my point!


Yep, and RL will never be as toxic, because there is no better breeding ground for toxicity than being locked ingame for at least 15 minutes with 4 randoms.


This! Replays are for beer


Seriously! People get so tilted when I don't skip but I'm usually just trying to crack my knuckles or rip a bowl.


Well if you're going to take my real concerns and belittled down then I have no need to talk to you because I already explained my point and no that's obviously not the same thing. It's not about it being effective it's about it requiring zero skills to do


Sounds like low skill to me.


And that's why you're diamond


I love it. I love getting demoed by a demo chaser who's way out of position (also why are you demoing second/third man?) and then my teammate immediately scores because it's a 1v1 on their side. I like that almost as much as dodging the demo and watching them fly into our goal


It's a very valid and important part of 1s strategy. On higher levels you might even see players completly stop the ball over the line, forcing the adversary to rush back instead of waiting for the open goal to be scored.


I don’t care if you agree or not, not utilizing a mechanic is objectively detrimental to you and your team lol taking a car off the map isn’t trolling, it’s strategy.


There's no forfeit? Why not?


I'm just trying to hit my dab pen and see if I should've front flipped or double jumped it's not a personal slight!


>It's not about it being effective it's about it requiring zero skills to do

Not correct. Demos take skill because you have to not only manage your speed and your boost, you also have to have good player prediction.

>I disagree. Usually it's a cheap Demo to score an easy goal because they see your partner being at a disadvantage or generally being an A**hole.

There is not such thing as a "cheap demo". That's called the "Scrub Mentality". Scrubs, as explained by several places referencing the mentality, commonly call things in the game as cheap.

>It takes no skill to demo unless you're adding some cool flick or something or doing it in a skillfully way.

No, it always takes skill because it requires player prediction. Obviously players at Bronze have no awareness of you, but as you get better at the game, so do players who avoid demos and you need to learn to predict their evasion attempts otherwise your demos will suck and almost never happen.

>And it's ridiculous to assume that you can just dodge a demo maybe you're god tier at the game or something because the demos you can see obviously you can avoid so that wouldn't really count in this Convo about getting demo'd

You can almost always evade a demo. It has nothing to do with being god-tier at the game and everything to do with awareness and learning evasion techniques.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There is no disagreeing. There's just being wrong. The vast majority of top players will tell you demos are a skill and avoiding demos are a skill. There's also the *fact* that demos are used at the pro level in every game. There's also the *fact* that every top player who gives advice to much lower ranked players about demos is to be aware and evade, because 99.9999% of demos are avoidable.


What? It is pretty easy to avoid demos in almost every situation (either by jumping or driving out of the way). Knowing how to time a demo with a moment when your opponent is unlikely to see a demo coming is no different than any other skill in this game. It is really hard to demo players that have good awareness.


Trolling and strategy aren't mutually exclusive things. It's a trolly strat.


See. That’s trolling (you said I don’t care if you agree and I said disagreed, just to be clear). And I know it is. When you’re constantly looking for the demo it takes the fun out for the other team. It’s a strategy, sure, just not one I like and not the way I choose to play. And I’m not the only one that thinks that. You do you boo. 
Side note thought: I need to get that champ badge on here dammit.


Disagree. Good luck out there.


You can’t ff in the first 15 minutes in LoL the same way you can’t ff in the first 90 seconds in RL


You can surrender in LoL, just gotta vote to surrender and some people would rather just make you suffer than move on from a lost cause.


You can *vote* to forfeit after 15 mins but at least 4 votes (out of 5) are needed so you may have to suffer for another 15-30 mins. Or you could
quit the game and uninstall it which is the better option.


You're literally wrong because anyone in the world with hands can press a boost button and hit someone that doesn't require skill. A 7 year can pick up the controller and run into someone while boosting that's not a skill.

Also, scrub mentality? There's plenty of videos in this very subreddit of cheap demos. Yes you take it on the chin and continue to play but it's annoying. If it's not annoying to you good for you. 

You can't always avoid a demo. Idk why you all keep saying that.  That's not even possible.


There's no point in arguing about it.


I disagree. Usually it's a cheap Demo to score an easy goal because they see your partner being at a disadvantage or generally being an A**hole. The people that demo ironically are also the chat monsters. It takes no skill to demo unless you're adding some cool flick or something or doing it in a skillfully way. And it's ridiculous to assume that you can just dodge a demo maybe you're god tier at the game or something because the demos you can see obviously you can avoid so that wouldn't really count in this Convo about getting demo'd


I would argue they are: trolling is just being a dick for the sake of being a dick, without concern for the game; making a play on the ball, and then going for a hit if it’s there is strategy.


If the other team isn’t having fun because they keep getting demoed, it means they are bad at a part of the game. That’s not my fault. No one said you can’t choose not to demo, just that it’s objectively choosing to not utilize a mechanic. 

I will do me, and that includes throwing the body and putting my team at an advantage.


Duly noted…


>You're literally wrong because anyone in the world with hands can press a boost button and hit someone that doesn't require skill.

When you over-simplify the skill like that, of course you can make it sound like it takes no skill. I can make the same bullshit and worthless point by saying: 

1. "Anyone in the world can press boost and point their joystick to fly and hit a ball, that doesn't require skill".

2. "Anyone in the world can watch the ball and see where it's gonna go, that doesn't require skill"

3. "Anyone in the world can put their car in the center of a circle and balance the ball to dribble, that doesn't require skill."

>Also, scrub mentality? There's plenty of videos in this very subreddit of cheap demos.

This subreddit is filled with scrubs too. You somehow think my point is debunked because you think the subreddit is valuable or something. It's not. The subreddit is filled with players of all skill levels, and there is going to be a large majority in the lower ranks simply due to how common they are. This means it also has many people with the Scrub Mentality.

>You can't always avoid a demo. Idk why you all keep saying that. That's not even possible.

You can nearly always avoid a demo. I didn't say always, but I said in 99.9999% of situations. If you think that it's avoidable in less than that, you have the awareness of a walnut.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I'm going to remind you that you, likely some random Gold or Silver, are arguing with an SSL (top 0.01%) about what takes skill in this game. You're wrong, get over it.


>You're literally wrong because anyone in the world with hands can press a boost button and hit ~~someone~~ **the ball,** that doesn't require skill. A 7 year can pick up the controller and run into ~~someone~~ **the ball** while boosting, that's not a skill.

To say that hitting the ball doesn't require skill would be silly, wouldn't it? And the ball has a very predictable trajectory and no dodge.

On a less argumentative note, I'd like to throw a plug for the Heatseeker game mode in here. At any level it grants you a lot of opportunities to practice blocking shots from within your goal, but one of the metas (once you get past Gold or so) is for one teammate to go HAM on bumps/demos while the other teammate defends goal. It's good practice for avoiding demos while still keeping yourself in position to make defensive plays.

It also helps to highlight just how hard it is to consistently demo an opponent who's on guard for it.


You are confusing mechanical skill with skill in general. Yes, a demo is not a mechanically challenging mechanic, in the same way as a mind game or low 50/50 is not mechanically challenging.

It is absolutely skillful, because it requires a good understanding of what your opponent is doing. Awareness is skill.

Also, I guarantee that the demos you think are unavoidable would be avoided 100% of the time by a better player. I have had the pleasure of playing in GC lobbies a handful of times, and decided to play aggro since my mechanics were not at their level. They always see it coming, and always get out of the way. Sure, only knowing how to dodge demos doesn't make you a good player, but you are not a good player if you get demoed over and over.


Incorrect. For example, trolling someone for "the tilt" is still technically a strategy, regardless of it's effectiveness. You can be a strategic troll.


Fair enough.

Ah yes.

Imagine raining that Ice on the Oceanid mobs.


Love how they slowed the video down just to show off the cake


That's a big AOE.


Subreddit today: i don't care if she's trash. I'm pulling.

&#x200B;

Subreddit after release: fuck mihoyo and their constellations. Don't pull for her.


I'm hoping for a character that would be able to get my Klee a Melt playground

like just keeping the cryo on enemies, no grass burns just ice that Klee would melt everytime...


So, after seeing her Q's AoE area size (and if the leaking information on its duration of 15 seconds are to be trusted) she's not Amber 2.0...

She's more like Amber 6.0


Everything about her is beautiful. That burst radius is so much larger than I expected.


That ganyu ult is gonna be insane with klee


That burst look like Crystal Maiden SS


Such a shame they made her a bow user instead of catalyst, her kit screams ice mage to me, "casted" ice bolt and blizzard/hail storm with huge radius aoe. It leads me to believe that if La Signora is confirmed and released she is high likely to be a cryo catalyst because they didn't want 2 5 star cryo catalyst.


OK those Frostflake shots charge-up WAY faster than I thought. It looks like it takes maybe a second or so of extra charging.

Ult also looks really good, it's like the Abyss Mage move on steroids. Hopefully the shards will drop on enemy locations instead of randomly.

I'm sold yo, I hope they don't butcher her before release.


My Cocogoat. Please come home.


Absolutely gorgeous. Can't wait to add her to my party. Sadly she won't come until January, and the wait is killing me.


She is going to be a good support for Amber


DAT ASS THOOOO...  MHY reallly knows what's good


Looks like the Amos Bow is her PRF weapon.


I do hope that charged shot is reaaaly strong. Just the time you waste to charge is absurd. Good luck vs mages teleporting and Fatui charging you with hammers... Also, archers tend to miss shots even vs targets in front of them, and claymore\\sword\\spear cant miss or be dodged, making bows not just slower but even weaker as main dps. There is a reason why Childe changes weapons to deal dmg after all. Cocogoat looks like another support, subdps.


I really liked her design but for mobile users she is completely useless, unless they fix the bug with the camera and aimed shot


c o c o g o a t


I don't care if she's good or not, I'm rolling for her. I must get Cocogoat for my Qiqi.


I really hope the ice shards from the ult isn't random and has separate cryo application per shard.  She'd be amazing as a cryo support that way.


sadly albedo will come first ganyu will be on january before xiao , so the wait continues


As much as I love Ganyu as a character, and as good as she may be, her gameplay being that of a bow user with eefectively a copy paste of ambers kit but with better multis qnd a different element just seems like super uninteresting gameplay to me


0:13 Okay I'm sold lol. Can't wait to get her!


She’s perfect


Shes so cute and cool. SOLD OUT!!!


at least they know what to show in the trailer


if the burst still works when she switches out, then that's gonna be great


ASS 10/10 must roll


To everyone planning to roll for her, please wait a few days after her release to see if everything in this trailer is legit or not.

Don't want another Zhongli situation.


Not pulling for shit until I see the reviews


Those thighs alone worth 5*.


Well, time to learn how to actually aim


Okay, hear me out. Klee (main) + Ganyu (cryo setup) + Diona (heal, shield, cryo resonance) + free slot for extra element/reaction/energy/buff (Fischl, Bennett, Xingqiu).

Basically, drop ult with Ganyu, now everything has crapton of cryo on it. Switch to Klee, use ult, now all that cryo is getting roasted with Melt. Cryo resonance gives extra crit, Diona ult for heals + extra cryo procs when Ganyu ult runs out. Diona and Ganyu charge each other's ult for a crapton of cryo setups for Klee.


The Golgoat power is over 9000.


I am rolling for her just because i have qiqi and i want them in the same team.


MUST RESIST FOR AYAKA


damn do i just have an archer fetish or does genshin make too many archers


Ah yes. Amber but cooler. Literally.


Her only problem is the fkin BOW. WHYYYYYYYYYYY A BOW


How is there already porn about her


Now i understand why they're called 'teasers' and 'sneak peeks'


Definitely saving for her!


Take my primos!!


Yes, please!


Shut up and take my wishes


That pose 13 seconds in... *blush*


Dat AZZ alone is worth all my primos


I wish she was a catalyst user. I can’t handle any more bow users. Waiting for you now instead Rosaria.


Ahhh, another bow user to add to my team full of bow users


Ganyu = [Hanyuu](https://www.google.com/search?q=hanyuu&source=lmns&bih=694&biw=1536&client=firefox-b-d&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB1YH5l8btAhVSx3MBHaRqAX4Q_AUoAHoECAEQAA)?? Similar hair color, horns, hairstyle also looks similar except Ganyu has ponytail.


Plot twist: she's support meant to increase survivability. Her main gimmick will scale with energy recharge.


With my limited primos for other characters and already have C2 Dionna, I’m gonna have to pass on Ganyu. I really love her design tho!


Am i missing something or does this not showcase the E?

i see auto, charge+, and the big AOE Q ability


She has some THICC "aoe"


yeah I don’t care about meta, I already have a team of 4 stars that can get me through most any content they’ve thrown out. If she’s really strong, great, if she’s not I could care less. I’ve been waiting for a waifu banner to roll on since literally the start of the game, and next to Mona she’s got the cutest design I’ve seen so far.


*Things I did not need from this game after pulling both Fischl and Diona inside of a week and immediately ranking them up to the rest of my characters*: **Another archer**. 

*Things I will be saving primos for and potentially even spending cash money on acquiring:* **Apparently, another archer**.


Awyiss, they are showing her with Amos' Bow, confirming that this is the bow designed for her, and I already have one. Must supply the Cocogoat with her bow ASAP.


Stay strong my Ganyu simps


Run animation is copy paste, bow shots seem copy paste from fishcl. Aimed animation copy paste.  More characters the better, but sad that they won't be that unique


Oh wow. That Cryo proc is insane for a bow user. I'm holding off on using my 5 star roll for her


So that’s who’s been murdering my Klee in spiral abyss


>Bow user

Dropped.


I'm complaining quietly to reddit that we have had four banners without a waifu and ganyu is coming after albedo.

Thank you for listening


Everybody gangsta until Mihoyo decides to make her a support


Ok people save the vid.

Comb the footage. 

And extract everything from this showcase. They will and expected to butcher ganyu so now we can be prepared for catching their shit on the act. If they stupid enough to do it twice


Another bow user Sadge


dang that ult looks cool!

&#x200B;

**furiously stares at bottom left corner**


GOAT

Between her, Papa Albedo, and Ayaka, my wallet is going to cry a lot.


tbh fam I don't care how she'll perform gameplay wise in live  
i've been simping for her ever since i saw her in story and now she's almost here aaaaaaaa


Me looking at the video: Oh shit, she has a two stage charged shot, that's pretty cool.

This sub looking at the video: _horny teenager noises_

You guys are way too thirsty lol.


That AOE tho definitely has peaked my interest minus that she’s already waifu BUT still. Look forward for her to drop. Idk if I’d actually add her to my main team cause I’ve been lazy af, but I’ll take it as a sign to switch things up if I get her. :, if the roll gods are in my favor


So I take she's confirmed 5*? Because I want her to support Klee... but my luck is awful most of the time.


I'm gonna break my F2P status just for her ass.


I want her, but I also A) want Ayaka, and B) suck with bow's aimed shot on mobile controls.

Both Ganyu and Albedo look really lackluster for 5 stars. The only good thing that looks good is Ganyu ultimate burst, even tho it's a copy of the ice abyss mage attack. They both look like Amber and Geo MC but augumented.


dont need another gimp bow user ffs tired of bow users that have to be built one way or the other.


These demo are so horribly done


Ponytail and naked back at C0 is more than enough


Cmon, Qiqi needs her cocomilk alrdy. From the looks of it, Albedo gonna come first uggh


She looks amazing but sadly I'm skipping her.


butt


She looks like a 4* in terms of design... She's at Fischl level or so and her skills aren't amazing neither. Albedo looks really like a 5* instead. Ganyu only has 5* legs but   feels like a boring character IMO


That Q really has a big aoe and her constellations don't really impact her utility as much so she'll be perfect for my Klee. Nerfs on the aoe would be unlikely since it will be false advertisement if they do so given that they have already released the pv.


Man that's cruel. releasing a trailer that I can't pull until next year.


An other bow character?!! Hell no... I just need a Diluc


Guys I’m making the liyue squad Ningguan/Zhong/Ganyu(bestgirl)and qiqi, gonna be FUN, fun because that’s what we are here to be doing, enjoying ourselves and having fun in the game


Great, another archer.

Then people gonna whine again how her AA multipliers are trash, how she's underpowered for a 5star hero, ect.


Kinda wish she’s a Cryo Catalyst user instead of an Archer. Really want to pull her, so im hoping she could work as a support because im just terrible at Archer gameplay


This is c6 cocogoat. Dont get too excited


I want her for the same reason i want mona


This could be us but you’re a bow user


I need a Cryo Waifu, but she's bow user so i guess i've to wait😭 If she would look better, i would go for her.
Idk why but bow users are lame except childe but only bcuz he can switch weapons.


After the way they showed Zhongli vs his actual release, I remain skeptical of any trailer like this one.


Bow user fuckk

They should've made her a catalyst user


That’s it I m pulling her.


Should I pull for Zhongli or wait for this Cocogoat waifu? I'm close at my pity right now and it will be the char in the banner. I'm really confused, is Zhongli C0 good? But i think my boi Razor together with Ganyu will be a good comp. Help guys.


learn my mistakes on Zhongli.. im gonna wait for pro review


Who cares about being nerfed, all i care is dem atck animation👀👀🤤


her Elemental Burst is basically Amber but **ICE**.


personally I'm not really fan of bow user. Especially those who need aiming to activate special skill. Because maaaaan... this game aiming sucks with controller  


But who cares. I pull for waifu


Her elemental skill and burst sound exactly like Amber's. Wow. An ice skin for Amber. Thanks.


Oh look it's my Waifu. If she doesn't do DMG and isn't OP i'm going to be mad.

/s


If only she uses claymore (not that I want more claymore users) I would use debate club on her and she is as close to yamato from one piece


Now watch as C1 enables the tier 2 charged shot, c2 makes the ult aoe 50% bigger, c4 makes dropping icicles target enemies instead of being random and c6 heals allies in the ult radius.


Imagine if the icicles spawned just below the birds lmao


I'm dropping this on those hydro abyss mages. Give them taste of their own medicine.


They made sure she had better stats, kit, and *assets* than Amber


Ikr? At first I was like eh I might not roll. But then that Cryo Cake showed up and I'm like Damn now I'm 90% rolling. Plus if her AoE Q is that large at c0 then looks like she's an improved Amber Cryo.


like 0:13? omg those legs, loving it


Looks like Mona finally has some competition outside of Noelle.


[That angle for her ult though](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763142485920710686/787019551615090699/ass.jpg)


What is our current ranking? 

Star cake > coconut cake = knight cake >Fishcake > Pirate cake = geo cake?


bonk go to horny jail


Wait til they nerf it at release. Gonna wait for reviews before pulling for her.


sorry I'm too focused on another BIG thing


Probably locked at C6.


Just wait for it to be nerfed in 1.2. Reverse power creep


LOL I was just thinking the same thing


Was about to write this lol, but yeah if you doesnt care about the gameplay mechanic then go ahead, but if you do care then wait couple of days until people properly test her.  


Buuuut dat ass tho.


Literally this. People were sucking zhongli off and look how that went, people campaigning And saying they won’t pull anymore are the same clowns hyped about Ganyu.

Mihoyo already won and will continue to lock the kit behind constellations if people will eat anything shown.

Diluc wins again.


Anyone know if shes gonnan be the first or second banner that'll come out?


Also she's the first waifu banner after 4 consecutive dudes & 1 daughter. So it won't surprise me if mihoyo pulls a zhongli on her.


Yeah upgraded amber or not, I’m torn because I want to roll for Ganyu but her play style does not interest me in the slightest.


ya, definitely this will happened. We already have a precedent of MHY screwing units over.   


Hell, i can foresee that if i were to pull cocogoat, i will have to pull her weapon as well just so that she can be decent.


I decided when her character was first revealed that I was pulling for her no matter what


because it's all just posturing and virtue signalling, I don't believe any of it until I see it happen


Way too many people pulled Zhongli because they liked his aesthetic and character then later regretted it and raged at Mihoyo. Ganyu might turn out the same way. Reminder to always wait for reviews or jinjinx to push out a video about them unless you truly don't care about performance

Edit: Mihoyo is in the wrong for making Zhongli weak, but it's also a reminder of why you shouldn't just immediately pull on a banner day 1


The everlasting cycle


Why are you generalizing? I for one am 100% sure that even if she is weaker than zhongli I would not regret pulling for her. I am sure that there are a lot of people that would agree with me too. Reddit and it's subreddit are a group of people, and as with any group of people we have our different opinions after all.


Ass > buff character


Ah yes the hivemind made up of 600k users but only one valid opinion...


We really need more enablers like Fischl and Xinqiu, most support can't really apply status as fast as main DPS dish reactions


Cocogoat + Fischl + Klee = the biggest gamer boner of my life. Pull out Oz, "boom boom bakudan!", Pull down the Cocogoat meteor of icicles, and go back to Klee and destroy everything.


klee applies pyro so damn fast it’s really going to depend on how quick those icicles hit but I’m very hopeful based on the trailer that she might actually be able to keep up with her


edit: I genuinely believe ganyu is going to be the prophesied cryo xingqiu


i use diona for klee she is  so good for klee her has shield +heal+ cryo field+ her shield reduce syamina consumption and give speed  love using her and xinq is great i used him before his Q swords reach before klee autoes so u still get freeze into melt if u use all together and vaporize is good anyway while klee need protection they do a great job


I hope the icicles are not randomly generated.


I mean the rain is slower than Amber's so it has to have bigger aoe otherwise it wouldn't work  , seems nice for Cryo application but i'm not too sold on her tbh , unless her damage numbers are of the chart i don't feel like replacing Kaeya for her when it comes to applying cryo .


And it was lock on C6 btw.


Which burst radius are we talking about here ;)


I really hope her Charge attack 2.0 playstyle is not just a gimmick and we'll get an actual archer carry, instead of another burst character.


So which is better Vaporize or Melt?


People were saying the same about Diona, only to be proven wrong.


I hope it doesn't have the RNG lol


Pog is this real matumbawoman?


Pog, my actual spamming hero before i quit dota to play genshin. Litteraly stuck at ancient 4, never divine i guess.


agreed. i love her design and her demonly horns - 100% waifu for me - but as bow user? my heart is broken (crying in primo's) - saving for the next i guess...


I guess I’m the only one who actually likes using bows...


Exactly. She would make good use of Solar Pearl, Mappa or Widsth.  
But what bow would be good for her - Stringless only? Because Rust, Compound, Favonius.  

Hm, maybe Prototype bow will have some usage for Aimed shots.


Yeah, it also doesn’t help that good bows are scarce and good bow characters aren’t. I’m already desperately trying to have enough bows for Childe, Venti, and Fischl. I don’t know how I could get a fourth.


I was expecting her to be mage but alas...


Yeah, her being a bow user makes me not want to pull for her when we already have so many bow characters already. If she used a catalyst I would’ve pulled for her for sure.


Im only excited because I have a harp and am having to use Fischl C2 as DPS right now


When it was first leaked people counted it to take about 1.8~ seconds, which honestly makes her C6 pretty overrated imo.

Just hoping the ult shards aren't random and I'm more than satisfied.


Unless you have enough primogems, the wait shouldn't be killing you, considering how much primos you can get to increase your chance of getting her.


The more you have to wait, you'll get more primogems to roll for her.


Unironically, yes. Proccing melts from 100 miles away.


Mona got a rival.


Who needs stats when you have an ass like that?


Yeah due to the passive,the further the better


Finally a reason to level up my amow bow


[deleted]


Well currently [Disclaimer this is a leak so it’s subject to change] her frost flake arrow does nearly the same damage as a fully charged arrow. But the AOE at level 9 deals 369 percent of her damage. And also in the leaks she had the same base attack as Diluc.
And her talents give her 20 percent crit rate after hitting a frost flake arrow. ~~So basically use her with Mona and the new cryo set to get a free 60 percent crit rate.~~ Her second talent gives everyone in its AOE a 20 percent cryo damage bonus.


That means you never played Mona or Amber, taunt exists.


Aiming mode when u press R helps a lot


It's instantly charged to lv.2 when lay down her E if you have C6. C2 gives her two Es, so that's two free charge shots.


Glad to know I'm not the only one having camera sensitivity issues during aimed mode


What bug are you referring to? I've think I've been doing ok at aiming on mobile, except when it comes down to hitting Ruin Guards. 

The aim sensitivity is completely wack on my laptop though, I can move my mouse across the entire table and the angle changes around 10 degrees.


idk, i do aimed shots just fine on mobile. i don't use it against small targets though


I wasn't going to pull anyways, but thanks for the heads up since I don't use bow users! Definitely avoiding the banner now!


I’m kinda happy cause it gives me more time to save for her


Why would they put 2 geo 5 stars in a row? Come on now... That sucks.


Very true. But at the same time, if I've never used Amber much (like most of the playerbase tbh) the similarity won't be a problem for me.   


Diluc is kinda uninteresting too. E = deal damage. Q = more damage. And that's about it. Yet no one complains about playing Diluc. Because he's strong af.


Her normal attack chain animation looks eerily similar to Fischl also. I would have preferred her to copy Venti's AA animation for more shots instead...

Well at least her double-charged shots seem to do a small AOE


I'm actually surprised she's a 5 star, gameplay wise it looks like a 4 star specially comparing with the previous 4 banner 5 stars which all have different quirks (even Zhongli).


Agreed. I don't plan on buying crystals so I got one shot at a 5\* for the next year or so, so I can't really justify committing to Ice Amber.


Yeah yeah, her moves are good as well, intersting charged attack. Nice ult animation. Definitely  shes not cry amber as many people thought


Idk, personally the fact that she revolves around charged shots is looking interesting enough for me, given how my main DPS has been autoattack Fischl since the game came out.


Oh god, don't even entertain the idea that it disappears when she switches out. That will make her unplayable...


It wont leave the field, there is a passiv that gives all party members 20% cryo buff in her burst.


Well personally I plan to use her whether she’s any good or not so I’ll be rolling day one.


I just want my lady with horns\~\~\~ I already have a good units, now I just want characters I like


Or just go into the test trial and read her constellations


bruh everyone who understood the game knew zhongli was gonna be weak. the only ones complaining are the ones roleplaying. 

ganyu's different since she's cryo but has slightly lower expectations than klee. childe was unexpectedly op because his melee Q turned out to be 700% on vaporize.


Zhongli came out exactly as described on HoneyHunter, so the only thing we don’t know is energy generation.

Ganyu’s multiplier’s are so high that she can easily be considered an S-tier carry like Childe and Diluc, even without knowing her energy regeneration.


Yup. Luckily I just blew through 30 wishes before getting zhongli


I'm hopeful for this exact set up. I won't be pulling right away until I know how she functions as a cry support for Klee!


Bennet, Venti or Mona would be good additions to that team.


It would be okay to have lots of archers if the mechanics were less copy paste. Slightly dissapointing the amount of copy paste they do in their characters. Run animations all same, bow aim animation and mechanic all same,


Maybe the ice flower bomb thing about 26 seconds in?


This might be a shock to you, but one of the biggest reason people play gatcha games is collecting Cool looking anime girls.


yeah, she's confirmed 5 star, and from the chinese test servers, they also said that she's a really good pair for klee.


Xiao gang?


It’s the other way around IMO. While Albedo's character art is okay his actual model looks pretty bad to me. I think Ganyu looks great all around.


Pull for who you like IMO.


zhongli is just ok. he's nothing special especially at C0


[deleted]


Imagine if the birds froze, fell on the floor and broke (or at least a decent amount of fall damage).


Hey, Amber's *assets* aren't that bad.


im sold, gonna roll for that asset.


Right, but does she have better stats than Zhongli? (This question isn't intended to be answered. we all know the answer.)


[deleted]


Yeah, it's going to be fun to see what she can do.


Jean ? anyone ?


They definitely know what they're doing with these trailers LMAO


surprised no one brings this up lol


That sounds about right, but I would say Librarian cake is in there somewhere


Dandelion cake >>>>>> everyone else


God damn, just say ass. The cake thing is super cringe.


if you thnk fischl is better than the pirate bitch


Rockstar cake should be in there as well. But definitely Maidcake ranks high.


Don't have to be horny to appreciate a nice ass though.


In Chinese livestream I loled when somebody in chat said all characters shown are at c6.


AoE could also be a drawback depending on how the icicle drop mechanic works. From the video it looks like it also drops icicles on spots where there are no enemies directly beneath it, so it probably just drops them at random spots within the AoE at set intervals. 

That means an AoE too big might actually mean it's harder to hit the enemies instead of wasting the icicles on empty spaces.


Doesn’t matter. Got Cocogoat


who cares, they cant nerf the thighs


Icicles look random so the aoe being huge doesn't even look like a good quality. The same icicle rate in a smaller area would be more useful imo.


I don’t care, I want cocogoat!


[deleted]


Doesn't matter. I have enough DPS to carry my cocogoat


even if she's trash i'm pulling because waifu


Imagine rolling for gameplay in a game with no PvP.

The game's balanced enough that no one's really unusable besides Amber


Unless there was a disclaimer before the video that states it to be footage of content that's still in development, I believe it is safe to assume that she will release in the state shown in the video. This is an official character demo rather than leaked footage of an unfinished build of the game.


Are people this stupid, you understand that the entire character developing process is constant buff and nerf right ? like it matter if they nerf or buff it before release, it's how they feel about the character


People call it a scam when you can literally test new characters and receive rewards before you roll.


Doesn't matter. My fish can carry the whole team who care about dps.


I just wanna note that none of her constellations increase the AoE of her burst, so that's what it'll look like at C0 in-game unless it gets nerfed


Happens everytime


I mean, I didn't care if Zhongli was going to be trash.

Still don't care, got him and I'm happy. Could he be better? Sure. But when playing a gacha game I just have to accept the cards that have been dealth to me.


eh, not EVERYONE. there might be a lot of people like that but i personally have been hyped about ganyu ever since i met her in the story (early october) and have saved up 17k primogems, 9 intertwined fates so far. 

i wasn't hyped about zhongli, in fact nothing will get me to pull unless it's literally ganyu's banner. i was hoping she would come later tbh specifically so i could keep saving up to get more constellations of her but alas, she's coming in just a month's time..

anyway, just wanted to say not everyone is like that


I agree, but sadly that’d only make pyro even more broken. Like imagine a cryo Xinqiu with Klee, the damage would be downright obscene.


[deleted]


lets wait for day 1 tests and the test runs  

From the current footage, it can be 2 things:  

1: its random  

2: it is randomish but skewed towards where enemies stand so basically random but with bad luck protection to not completly derp out


For real, how are they generated? They have to be random, or just targeting every enemy would be quite OP in this radius


I mean her 2charged aimed shot has ult-like multipliers and they are available on demand, no need for nrg ofcourse on hectic battles it can be hard to find time for them but then she can taunt enemies to find space... seems like a solid unit hoping they don't nerf her before release.


She has the same base attack as Diluc.


shows how easily misinfos get carried, her c6 in honeyhunter has nothing to do with aoe range.


Sauce?  Most recent beta leaks show her c6 having nothing to do with her ult.


🍑


If numbers don't change, her playstyle for damage will revolve around the charge shot. 

483% at lv 6 every 2 seconds? Sounds ok to me.


I firmly believe "main DPS" and "carry" are just resource optimization hacks the community came up with to bypass the resin restrictions, not roles mihoyo actually balances characters around. I think the intended way to play characters is the current whale quickswap "meta" where you don't really stay on any character to autoattack but just rotate your E and Q abilities constantly.


Same. Please please please make that charge attack damage actually worth it over spamming normal shots.


Melt does much higher damage when pyro procs it compared to vaporize


Melt better for pyro trigger.

Vaporize better for hydro trigger.


Because Diona's ult pulses way too slowly.


Sadly I think its rng, some of the shards in the video were no where close to the mobs.


Bro same. Basically the only reason I don't want to go for her is because she uses a bow


Ganyu is perfect for me! I enjoy Amber's gameplay but am too much of a meta-slave to overlook her downsides. Ganyu has 5* stats and a stronger kit that justifies slotting her even when new 4* are released.


If charged shots were worth it them I'd love using bows. But as of now they don't do anything aside from reactions


yea i play on pc and using bows is more fun than anything else. if you're on mobile or console though i can see why you'd hate it


You're not alone, bows are fun.


Amos bow. She's a charged shot archer.


As a main damage dealer Viridescant hunt would be one of the best because it allows you to get close to 100% crit rate with other buffs like the ice artifact 4-set and her own passive, it is also extra cc to help give you time and space to land those charge shots and bridge the down time of her elemental skill or you can go with the prototype bow (not the compound bow because it gives physical damage as a stat and Ganyu is VERY much about cryo damage as her passive ascension stat is cryo damage up 28.8% at level 80).

Stringless is good if you are actually building her for damage as a support burst but if you’re only using her for elemental reactions then not needed so in that situation favonius will be better.

Her basic attack string is unlikely to have the damage output that her charge shots have so that make rust a questionable choice too.

obviously Amos will be her best weapon as a main dps but that’s a 5* and hard to recommend - if you have it use it if not then likely VH.

I will be running her as main damage and using VH with 4 set cryo artifacts, cryo damage goblet, atk% sands and crit damage circlet, then *trying* to get crit damage, crit rate, atk% and then either flat attack or energy regen on each artifact (wish me luck).

That’s one benefit of her being 2nd is I have time to grind the artifacts ready for her lmao.


>Stringless only?

Here I am, with 2 Sacrificial and Favonius, not a single Stringless. Yay


I wouldn't say we have "so many bow characters" when there is one more catalyst user currently in the game than there are bow characters.    5 Bows vs 6 Catalysts.   It would have been worse if she was a catalyst user given your criteria.  Of course, nothing holds a candle to how many one handed sword users are in the game, of which albedo just adds to that.


Keep in mind that you'll also be aiming during the 1.8 seconds so if you take a second to aim you're really only saving less than a second. With that kind of timing C6 might not even be that noticeable.


i got 85 summons and i was hoping she would come second but the urge to pull is HIGH. ive been saving up for her for a while though so i shall continue saving.


It doesn't help when you already have enough for her...


I had zero interest in her before, but now that you said it I'm kinda interested? I've raised my Amber to be a really strong reaction damage dealer, so that sounds perfect.


they literally have the same body


Give it to me...


No. Why would it? Headshots and other weak spots are automatic 100% crit, and she can get crit from the artifacts for enemies that don't have weak spots. Amos' Bow is about charged shots, which is exactly what she's built for.


not really. it gives her enough crit where crit subs are good enough.

amos' bow has atk% as sub which is very good once you have enough free crit rate


Try playing in COOP when most enemies are yeeted all over the place though :x

With 4 people we had mobs reset due to such a long time in air :/


Thats whale territory already, I'm looking at it with mortal eyes. I hope she is good, but I'm not feeling it so far.


We can run her at C0, but C2 is what people should strive for in my opinion depending if they have the Primogems of course... Which I do not so I better get  starting on saving.

Thank goodness Albedo is first.


I can't move the camera upwards when I'm in aiming mode, it's impossible to hit the target's weak spot because the aim gets locked in one position


Idk what he's referring to but I'm mobile only and have no trouble at all with aimed shots, for what it's worth.


I'm not. Because of that and being close to soft pity I have to skip new 4* from Albedo banner.


yea , i saved for her, xiao ,ayaka i have about 10k primos + 64 pity count cuz i skipped childe, zhongli dunno what to do anymore bcuz im tired of waiting lol


Same. Really need more time to collect more gems.


because albedo is the support for support zhongli that they talked about.

yes, you need 2 geo 5 stars to make zhongli work


feel u bro i was hyped bcuz i was  certain they will not put 2 geo in a row , but was disappointed when i watched the live dev discussion


I feel you. I got an offbanner Diluc and his damage numbers are great, but all he sorta does is hit and hit harder. 

I finally decided to clear Abyss for the free Xiangling and I definitely prefer her playstyle, combos really well with my Fischl.


Diluc's gameplay is like Riven from LoL. 3 hit skill that you interweave autos with for max dps, and and ult that launches a wave from their sword and buffs their auto attack for a duration.

And that character has a lot of fans. I wonder how many Diluc fans are Riven mains.


> Diluc is kinda uninteresting too. E = deal damage. Q = more damage. And that's about it. Yet no one complains about playing Diluc. Because he's strong af.

Exactly, because he's strong. We have to wait and see if Ganyu is strong, but bows are really bad at dps and support is flooded with good characters. Gonna be tough to beat the competition without "lol I have Diluc and Klee for unga bunga melt damage", so her "plain" kit doesn't help how people view her right now.


[deleted]


Lisa's stays out when she swaps, right?  This feels very similar (big elemental core maintaining a circle of damage) so I can't imagine it would actually vanish with her.


Waiting for venti rerun gang ✊


Sorry to disappoint you but I'm planning to be Ayaka gang.


Everyone to his own taste


Ok, thank you. :)


It looks like they are, so this ult seems very unpredictable in terms of damage.


They're RNG, but it looks like it at least tries to spawn nearby the enemy, just not directly above them.


Man that should be a thing. Frozen/petrified goes shatter on impact taking double fall damage


Imagine..


Amber can be as shit as she wants in terms of gameplay but she’s cute af


Indeed. Just look at her absolute territory.

*Chef's kiss.*


Im pretty sure they reuse the same few models for their characters, so amber has the exact same assets as ganyu


Stay innocent


Thicc and does AoE Anemo damage


;)


It... It refer to her E, she spawn ice lotus that looks like cyro cake.


RIP haha


Yeah Jean and Keqing would like a word.


She never gets the respect


jeane is THICC


Oh right. I can’t see it very often without playing with camera angles though.


Pirate is better as a character, but it is hard to see her behinds with her dress.


Oh right I knew I forgot someone


[deleted]


Either they show the characters at C6 and "forget" to tell us, or they show what we will actually get and risk us not throwing money at them.


Why wait for reviews?  
New characters are immediately playable in trials where they slap a mediocre artifact set and a favonius set weapon on, so if a character already feels decent in trials they'll blast ass with a bit of investment.    
   
Trust your own judgment rather than reviews, no matter how good a character may be it won't matter if you dislike the playstyle.


But are they wrong??


If the numbers are right it lasts 15s in a 20s cooldown so that might still be impactful


You get cocogoat, but i make sweet love to cocogoat and get all tasty cocogoat milk!


No you didn't yet.


Y’all realize this is the exact same argument that Zhongli players also made? INB4 MHY claims Ganyu is a taunt support that apply a Cryo in a large area and is not supposed to deal damage.


I hope they are just visual and the area just ticks every 2 seconds.


they are not random. They are appearing directly over the mobs in the zone.


That's true, but some characters are just so well-loved, people would be pulling on them even if they're worse than Amber.


I'll just pull if I like what I get in test run.


Amber is also usable.


Sorry but Amber being pyro means she is one of the most useful characters in the game right behind all the other pyro characters but above most of the ones that aren't.

70% of all the overworld puzzles are for pyro characters, baron bunny counts as a character for geo platforms. Even with diluc on your team Amber is just better at lighting spread out torches. Amber's only problem is her aoe is small and her bunny has a collision box and can be bumped out of the blast range.


Genshin has combat aspect in it so why not? Sure no PvP but some like to compete in Abyss and stuff

Not everyone here plays just for the sake of waifu anyways vice versa, so dont mind how others play the game


What are you saying? Amber by herself can clean the thundering fury domain all by herself. Slap her some thundering fury set and stringless and she easily clears the domain.


where have you been this past week? have you not seen all the rage over zhong li? Most people on here roll for gameplay apparently considering all the rage and shitposting that this sub just went through


The japanese text at the bottom of the screen literally says "This is development footage."


It does matter. Look at zhongli


But you can’t choose optimal team comp, weapon and artifact while testing.


Same bruh. Have enough guarantee pity for her. 4 weeks to go


Agreed. I would rather they make interesting support mechanics rather than a reskinned element application


I was thinking about a pyro enabler for Childe actually, or ice for razor


I'm thinking that it works on the same principle as Lisa's ult. Huge AOE that's more like the visual representation of its range, pummels one target at a time albeit using a different graphic representation, and last for quite a while.


not OP if limited by how many can be generated at the same time. with an AoE that big if it's 100% random you might never hit an enemy with those icicles.


The Icicles seem to target the enemy within the radius, but the icicles don't seem perfectly centered, so there might be some randomness post-targeting. Might not be too bad considering the icicles are aoe and likely won't miss since no enemy moves fast enough their own to dodge it. 

Maybe a hillicurl running to attack you or a large charging shield one


This is just sarcasm okay? Chill dude. This is just for memeing Zhongli's constellation.


I see you are a Man of culture as well


I mean, you can believe it, sure.

But then you actually look on character kit and see some characters have both their skills, passives, and
constellation work even when they are out of the field, while others lose their skills the moment you switch from them. By some coincidence, these characters have much higher basic attack numbers and damage-oriented ascendance stats.

Good luck with constantly quick swapping from Razor, or Klee for example.


But charged shot freezes on demand tho


Yeah, this is also my only problem with her. I play on mobile and bows are not fun to use. I would pull for her in a heartbeat if she was a catalyst user. Her design is still tempting me a lot though so I will probably wait for the numbers.


Well then get excited for ganyu because her charged shot is crazy strong (at least the current numbers are, hopefully they don't nerf it)


People haven't realised that there is like 5 character models shared amongst all characters. It's so weird that sucrose/Mona/Fischl/Xiangling are all exactly the same height


but the cocogoat is what qiqi is searching for


So a even battle


Sometimes I feel like no one on this subreddit has ever seen a human ass in their lives.

"DADDY ZHONGLI IS THICC!!"

Bitch, they're all sticks.


Crit are never enough, it have exponential growth. While amos is god tier i think skyward are worthy contender, you can go with crit dmg helmet with new cryo artifact.

But amos bow have better matching skin for her art, ill go with that.


bow users can hit weak spots so she can do deadly shots, slow attack speed is alright


Yesterday I played co-op and there was a Geo Mc User...

Man, the guy created so many rocks in the domain, that it was so hard to predict or see WHERE the abyss mage was stunned or teleported, I was using Fischl for the recommended element. And yeah... As you guess, it ended in a wipe-out because the mage started to cast its shield behind one of these rocks, and the damage when they do so is huge, so slowly, people were dying for nothing.

After that, it was my ticket to tell me myself to do it alone.


Probably if you wanna play ganyu supp, c0 should be enough while if you wanna play her as dps, you need to have her at least c2 for quick charge shots. Sure, you can play her dps even at c0, but as you have seen, it's really slow. We will see btw, Zhongli lesson learned.


Yep, me too. She's gonna be a fairly expensive Cryo support for us F2Ps, but whales get the option to maybe turn her into a competent sub dps.


Why C2 in particular?


Ah I see I see. I can move up while aiming Mobile, but it seems to go diagonal rather than vertical which is a massive pain. I've gotten used to compensating for it, but it also makes my aiming slower.


If it makes you feel any better there most likely isn’t a new 4*


Rip, you’ll most likely miss out on Rosaría which is unfortunate. How close are you to pity?


Fair enough, I saved for Zhongli who I got and now I’m just saving for Ganyu.


you can go on the blue banner. We are getting Blue Fates on 1.2 based on how many characters you have ascended at 20/50/70. Maybe you get some good 4\* and the wait becomes more bearable


Yeah man, I got my Zhongli, now I just need a good DPS and she looks like she can fill that role for me


The funny part is that i am pretty sure zhongli is the support of this relationship , it's not albedo making zhong li good, it's just zhong li making albedo better lol (and he probably doesn't even need zhong li for that).


Well yeah except diluc is much easier than riven


Although the gameplay mechanics seems really similar, as a Riven main I hate Diluc. 


In LoL, Riven had a niche kit that gave her a lot of mobility and variaty in comparison to other champs. In Genshin, almost all characters have the same mobility, and their kits are very varied. That turns Diluc into a Garen instead of a Riven: Throw him in the middle, push all buttons and win. No skill needed, as he simply has big numbers. Really unfun.


well you said it. She's unreleased. You use other bow users to say that she cannot be dps (how can this be an argument...) and others use datamines to say that she could be one.  


" Gonna be tough to beat the competition without "lol I have Diluc and Klee for unga bunga melt damage"   
That applies to every DPS in the future and not just Ganyu so idk how that's a bad point against her. And Childe is a great DPS/nuker who is not Pyro.   


 "her "plain" kit doesn't help how people view her right now."  
Again, we'll have to see. If anything, since charged shots take so long and can even miss, I think the raw numbers are going to compensate for that. It's harder to screw up a DPS char than it is for jack-of-all-trades like Zhongli.


According to HoneyHunter, Ganyu’s charged shots hit harder than a full Diluc E combo.


Well don't forget venti is a bow user, and he lis literally the best character in this game.


> "lol I have Diluc and Klee for unga bunga melt damage"

This is basically me. I don't desire Ganyu as a carry. I desire her as a reaction bot for Diluc and Childe. I'll run Diluc/Childe/Qiqi/Ganyu and get the cryo elemental synergy. I'm pretty pumped. 

Also, I feel the need to emphasize that I'm not a whale, I've only spent around $50.00. Qiqi was from reroll, Childe was a pity, and Diluc was a pity I gambled on from the normal banner (finished out a pity that was ~30 pulls away due to all the free standard banner fates)


Diluc and Venti are completely bad examples.

Edit :Do read my comment below if you're gonna see this person's question and decide to blindly diwnvote (I mean if you want to go ahead, but at least read my explaination) and skip my explaination.


>and they're both very effective.

I'm not talking about effectiveness. Usually 5 stars featured in a banner have moves very different from the rest of the roaster (Diluc is not included there). I think Venti is still more unique in that sense.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing, Zhongli is very unique and he's... you know.


Greedy Mihoyo might make her C4 "Ganyu's crystal rain now remains, even when switched out"


👍


Ayaka gang rise up \\o/  


Better start farming that [cryo set](https://i.imgur.com/SziuXq5.png)


Uh... you might have to wait a long time


Yeah literaly the exact opposite, yes it’s taste, but albedo is as boring gameplay and asthetic wise and the main character, the whole concept of a bloom shotting archer waifu is too good


Save for the cocogoat, not only will she be better, she’s best girl


Looked like it spawned near enemies, area is too big to be completely rng


Yeah... For the player


Her writing is great too. She's a competent, non-annoying, decent side character with personality, without falling into tropes of "rugged female protagonist"


I see you are a person of culture.


(Late reply, but...) they definitely use the same  *skeletons* - e.g. Adult Male, Adult Female, Young M/F, "Loli"... but within those archetypes probably the majority of each character's model is still individually-made. At least for the sake of clothes/armor/etc., but it's still fairly evident that *assets* are tuned on individual scales as well - just look at Childe ass vs Zhongli, or Jean chest vs Beidou.


wtf? AoE anemo damage is a fart or am I missing something?


Same man, best of luck with the rolls! Sucks that she'll be second but on the plus side more time to save up primos.


Just dont touch the horns, she hates when you touch the horns


Yup waifu needs no stats, just stay cute and talk to me all day while I leave the game idle


Hell yea dude. If others call her bad, we will make her good ourselves. Lacking energy regen or damage? We will hunt a thousand slimes to give her the best artifacts.


Yeah same for me


Blessed be the Cocogoat cult


And for 5 stars they get story quests so we can test them out a bit more.


Because there might be mechanics/tricks that you aren't aware of when testing out the character.


You mean once you get cocogoat you're gonna coconut some milk.


Bonk


that's exactly what people said before zhong li was out, every single post on here was calling him a "husbando". Turns out when he actually dropped though everyone's inner meta demons came out and the "husbandos" slowly disappeared. I'll believe it when I see it, but most people who are saying they will get a character and not care are liars considering what we just went through.


Test run isn't adequate, these domains are heavily catered towards the characters. And I think they may have constellations on them as well, though not sure about that. It's certainly not representative of how they play for real.


Yeah, I guess I was over exaggerating a bit. After she gets her c1 she's got a niche at least


And the bunny scales off HP so it dies before your burst connects


I'm just a bit frustrated hearing people who love zhongli as a character to death decide to not roll for him because they heard someone's opinion that he's incredibly bad. (It's besides the point, but I already think he's better than 2 or 3 of the 5 stars we already have in game)

The effect was strong enough that my wife started feeling bad that she spent money on him until we realized that the "buff zhongli, he's awful" stuff was just hype


no it doesn't, because that how it gonna be from the start


You can’t in any other 5star banners, why you only complain it now?


Kaeya is one of the best enablers for Razor


Xiangling is the best pyro support right now especially if you have the constellation that increases duration of her burst. Only downside is that Guoba's AI is kind of dumb, would love if he prioritized targets that didn't have pyro status already and sometimes he'll just hit the same guy over and over


Xinyan kinda works as a Pyro enabler, doesn't she?


lol i assumed you took that from a reply in the top comment


True, Razor is a good counter example for sure. I'd argue he is balanced to be a strong unit early to midgame and then falls off late game. Klee is kinda on the edge for me. You ult, you E, do a few charged attacks then swap off after 5-6 seconds. You lose a bit of value on the ult that way before C4, but I can see her working like that in a quickswap comp.


Charged melee should always apply elemental effects too imo. At least for travel. Hate switching out characters just bc diluc or beidou can't light towers fast enough


They do small changes don't they? Least my friend said Zhongli has a more eeehh defined? Ass. Mona as well.


pretty much. there are kids, slim teens, and slim adults. this game is so boring in the body type department


Being the same height doesn't mean they have the exact same body.


with the way artifacts are right now, many characters actually find they don't have enough atk% since only 1 slot is reserved for it.

It really just depends on your subs. An attack%, crit rate, or crit damage sub is pretty much equally viable by lategame.

Crit rate makes it less thinking to build just because it lessens your options, but the ratios of all the stats mirror each other.

The game is pretty balanced around the amount of each stat they give you on substats


Again - in single player or on LARGE mobs sure. But abyss mages/flowers and smaller mobs are impossible to even hit - anywhere - when theyre yeeted by 3 other players 10 times a second in the middle of air :P

They should tone down yeeting in coop overall, it gets annoying.

I agree with slower attack needed. But yeeting in coop on the other hand... is just too much. And makes Ganyu unplayable in coop without some hard CC.


quick charge is locked behind c6 not c2.  You need her maxed to get quick charge.  Really hope they add it to her ascension talent, at least then she'd have a unique trait compared to amber.


You know, it did actually. Means I may save enough primogems for them.

And well, seems like Hu Tao will be 5\* now, so even more reasons to farm primogems for 1.3 banners.


I don't really think this is true. They showed Rosaria.


Where's that info from?


Last time I've got 5* at 77th pull. Now I'm at 58 with enough primogems for 37 pulls. And because I have literally one 5* so far and she's not a DPS I wont take a risk pulling on useless (to me) Albedo banner being left w/o a chance to get Ganyu.


"rosaria" LOL

We've known for a month and a half now, since childe banner specifically, that 1.2 doesn't have any new 4\*, if there were any they would have leaked along ganyu and albedo, and they didn't show anything during the stream, there isn't any new 4\*.


Diluc onetricks have the same toxic attitude as Riven mains


Yeah, though it's easier to weave autoattacks and skills in Genshin than in MOBAS/ARTS in general.


Still not out. I'm not going based off pre-release stuff. Don't know who Zhongli is?


[deleted]


She has an entire second level to her charge shots which make them AoE, that's pretty unique compared to our current bow users


May you get your Xiao.


Will do but Idk what Artifact to dispose.


Watch again, there are multiple shots.

Some icicles land far away. Some land on her, while she's standing some distance from the slimes.


C4 - 50% increase in icicle spawns directly over a random enemy

C6 - Every icicle will spawn over a random enemy

touchwood.


Remember what Zhongli's trailer was like vs. when he launched


I think she's really likeable. Even more so if you've read the manga. But people hate her because she's one of the starter characters, so she isn't terribly powerful. I still enjoy using her, with a couple of constellations on her she's pretty decent for bosses and guardians. Sometimes characters are more than just empty DPS machines, I like to switch to Amber when scouting or exploring (of course, when I need to fly my best).


Stay innocent. You dont wanna stare at the abyss for too long. IT will consume your soul


Nice, I should be able to get her C1-2 with saving gems and the blessing then.


but I can't save, I always feel the itch to pull I already wasted 20 pulls on weapon banner lol


means its ok to touch other places?


That is sad.


Preach


Some 4* also get story quest (Xingqiu, Razor)


Part of Zhongli's appeal was him being strong. Not in terms of numbers, but in his personality, lore, history, etc. But in order to live up to that fantasy, he has to at least not be garbage tier in game or there will be significant dissonance that breaks the immersion.

Unless they nerf Ganyu's bodysuit, tights, tits, ass and voice - which are the main reasons for pulling her, she should be safe.

She's also cryo, which automatically makes her useful even if she can't carry at c0.


I always make a scale on beauty vs gameplay and make my decision on it. Example: I hated childe lol, i don't like these types of characters that are snarky and smug and once they show up its obivious they're the villain so i rated him like 3/10 on beauty, but then..... i played him on test and HOLY SHIT, that was a 10.
Zhongli was a good 7/10 on beauty for me but...yknow he's uhhh..... so i didn't try to get him.
Albedo is also around 7-8/10 and he looks kinda fun.
Ganyu and Rosaria are instant 10 to me LOL so yeah, gotta get them.


Well... Ok fine, you're correct. I'm one of those people.


Its adequate for me.

They don't have constellation (at least none as of yet did) and always have same artifacts and energy recharge weapon (although Zhongli had Prototype Grudge instead of Favonius weapon like the rest). I can form my opinion on test run alone, tho most ppl probably should wait for reviews.


There's no bad characters, only bad players.


It's actually pretty useful as decoy. In the guyun domain, for example, place it, ruin hunter goes for it, climb the rubble in the meantime, then the ruin hunter goes to flying mode, snipe it down.

No other character can do that.


I mean, if you loved the character "for" his aesthetics, lore, husbando factor and stuff, you shouldnt let yourself get affected by his combat viability and just focus only your main reason of wanting him

Though they actually need to buff and fix him, just for the sake of those who loved Zhongli no matter what and those who pulled hoping for an actual top-tier unit so their pulling for a 5s (which we know is a very big investment already) dont go to waste, we dont hate him (some do for some reason), we just want a better Zhongli and a worthy title of a Geo Archon


This is not MMO.... 
This is gacha AKA gambling. There won't be a buff/nerf cycle like in other games. It's really really rare for a character to get a buff and almost impossible for nerf. Which is one of reason why people were outraged at Zhongli


Maybe because after getting other 5 stars and build them properly, they don’t suck and perform like a 4 stars?


We only started to complain when its the 1st 5* that are underpowered? Wow so weird


Don't know, Childe problem is that he apply water and proc Vaporize faster than anyone can apply Pyro, not sure if she can do it that fast, he would need a Pyro Oz or Xinqiu to keep up with him


Oh. My bad. Atleast we understood each other. I mistook that you got serious suddenly.


You can make "work" anything since the challenge is low, and this "work" is not quantifiable. 

But saying that Mihoyo designed all characters for quick swaps is just stupid since it's clearly not a case.


Yeah they change the bust size too. But if the character is the same height then it's got to be the same model.  
  
However, beidou and Jean are almost identical.


Zhongli seems to share the same model as Diluc. Kaeya has a really flat ass in comparison.


Yeah faces, bust size for girls and I know asses for guys are all the things that are at least different. But it's not so much that the asses are different but more that the textures on their clothes and the polygon counts are different. I also have only seen that the guys' asses are different so it's possible the girls might be all the same but I kinda doubt it.


It’s really just clothes and what they choose to outline


Obviously because Zhongli just has more form fitting pants. The "doll" is the same, they're just painted differently and clothed differently.


Imagine if we had a fat teenager as a playable 5 star? EVERYONE would roll for him.


I'm not saying they have the exact same body. Mona is bustier than Xiangling.   
 
But they derive from the same body template. They start from there and increase curves and features as they see fit.


Usually you have more than enough from timepiece + substat.

The thing is atk% not benefit from flat atk feather / flat atk substat, while crit as modifier benefit from flat atk.

Assuming you get 46.6% from timepiece + 40% from substat(10%/each other pieces) you already get 86.6% thats already plenty. Not counting buff from noblesse/thrilling tales. Bennet buff also not multiplied by atk%, but it multiplied by crit.

Lategame crit is everything, its exponential growth. 

The thing that make amos bow god tier are the dmg% increase(passive), not atk% increase, dmg% increase take the same modifier spot as elemental dmg% increase, skill dmg% increase, burst dmg% increase, normall/charged dmg% increase. Its hard to get on artifact(only on goblet).

Crit is not less thinking, you can calculate the outcome (for example 60% chance to crit 120% crit dmg = 62% increase in overall damage). You want to spread as much modifier as possible 1,5 x 1,5 x 1,5 is better than 2 x 1,5 x 1


Honestly I've never had a problem with Fischl and the yeeting. Mainly because Oz has that effect where if you charge a shot at him he delivers extra lightning damage. So as long as oz is close to said yeeted mobs Fischl just stands still and blasts arrows at Oz.  

Although I'm not sure how that will work with the flower.


alright but may i ask what does YEET mean ? 

Thank guys


You are right. That's even worse. Well ganyu supp, here we go. Luckily for me Diluc and Razor are enough as main dps.


If Hu Tao is a 5\* I'm gonna go broke rolling for her, Ayaka and their weapons...


If there were a new 4* they presumably would have been advertised during the 1.2 trailer like Diona and Xinyan were in the 1.1 trailer. Rosaria was confirmed to appear in the event story but nothing was shown that suggests she’ll be obtainable yet.


Yeah I get you, my main DPS rn is Ninguang so I’m hoping to pull Ganyu. Good luck man :)


I’ve got you beat: I’m at 73 pulls and no pity. I can’t risk even one pull on the next banner if I want to guarantee Ganyu. But I got that c1 Ning, so worth it.


58 gang  
I got a Jean on Childe banner at 76, now I'm at 58. Got a Bennet c0, so I don't think I'll risk losing coco thighs for 20% more attack.


https://imgur.com/pzjkJm8


Please do some research before starting to doubt people...


got one friend who is a diluc main and he always annoy ppl with his "iF yOu dOnT hAvE dIlUc tHeN yOu ArE PoOr" all the time bruh


Zhongli released exactly as HoneyHunter described. The only unknown was the energy generation on his E.


> How so? 

Because, despite being plain, they are VERY strong, the best in the game, and this far offsets that. It'd be a different case if you brought up Razor who, while strong with a generally unpopular design, is either used a lot or a little because of that and his kit being strong but not at the top.

There are two core reasons why people will use anyone in a game:

1. How meta/strong/effective they are

2. How much they like their design

If you fulfill either of these, especially both (which they both do as people like "traps"/young boy designs and Diluc's design), people are using them regardless. This is why they are the **worst** examples.

An example for myself is how I've yet to stop using Zhongli. He's terrible, as we all know, but his design is really good and my favorite.


We must pray Rng when we pull for our favourite character🙏🙏🙏


Theres two showcases in the video; Vs the hydroslimes and the abyss mage

Both showcases the icicles spawn semi-randomly around the enemy

It seems to drop 2-3 times a second


remove this


I think the issue is more that she is so completely gimped. if baron bunny just did a fire aoe around it or pulsed fire, it would be at least usable for reactions but as she stands currently, her abilities are very non existant and any archer can really do exactly what she does but with real skills. 

Some people do main her and play her but that doesnt make her helpful baseline sadly =(


May the RNG gods bless your rolls. Idk if I can try for constellations cause right after that the save for Ayaka begins lol.


I hear ya, but you gotta be strong. Do it for her!


But think, you'll be getting Acquaint Fates for your ascended characters, so you might get 20-30 pulls from that to tide you over


Definitely.


really sad... edit: why did i get downvotes?? i didn't do anything


appropriate username i guess 🤔


There's no bad characters, only limited resources.


more like they use it as a tool to further blasting Mihoyo, like it change anything


I guess it's only feasible vaporize on his ultimate. While normal attacking I guess it's better for him to be the enabler for someone. Like a Sup DPS Xiangling, always proccing vaporize with her ult, or Fischl always proccing supercharged.


What are you saying then? You gave me 2 examples, 1 of which is desinged to be on the field for a long time, one is 50/50 and works either way imo. There are 25 more characters in the game. I think all 25 of them work better if they are not constantly on the field. How is that stupid? Sure there is 1 exception. I still think the argument stands for the rest of them.

Edit: actually there is Noelle too, so make that 2 characters.


I don't know if it's the same for the girls but the guys' asses all have different polygon counts so yes their asses are different. It might only be a difference on the textures or their clothing and not the asses themselves or something but there are slight differences


Ive played fat teenager irl. Would not recommend. Very low tier


childish jiang banner when


With ice looking like the element with free crits, it seems likely that you can get a lot of free crit rate at which point attack% becomes more important. We don’t know her constellations yet. If it’s anything like kaeya’s she could approach 60% crit rate just by hitting frozen enemies. At that point with decent subs harp is wasted. Save harp for another element bow user :P


Yeet="Throw around" iirc, personally experience this when playing with Ventis, Dilucs and Jeans. But I personally think it's really helpful if you pair a Venti and a Sucrose cause they kinda stay in one spot that way no matter who is doing the dps


Throw violently


Other people were faster with explanation. Here is the animation :D

If Hu Tao is a 5*.....Oh boy I'm fucked. I hope she's a 4 star on Ganyu banner. I mean, otherwise they'd have run out of 4 * characters to put on banners without reusing the old ones already. Other than the ones we get for free and Bennett ofc.


They showed her for a reason, and they didn't reveal who the banner characters are yet. I'd be extremely surprised if she wasn't on the banner.


Me too. Pulling for C1 Ningguang was worth like 90 pulls to me. I've got C4 Diona and C4 Beido on Childe Banner on the way but barely got C1 Ning.


He means they didn't showcase any 4*s like they did for Diona and Xinyan.

Just appearing in the story trailer does not mean they will appear in the banner, or Xiao and Ganyu would have been in 1.1 banner.


[removed]


Is not something to worry about for now since we can check this in the test run before pulling, if it is completely random then I am not pulling.


I try dude, trust me I try to XD

You can add on any character that has a long cooldown skill/burst since they don't work well in quickswap comps. Xiangling, xingqiu, fischl, diona, etc. all suck in quickswap teams because they are entirely designed to support carries rather then dish out consistent burst damage on a low timer. So did mihoyo just design them with being shit in mind? I really don't think your argument holds up.

Really the only good quickswap characters/teams are ones that can ult often and for big dmg: venti with jean for battery, zhongli/ning have 40 cost ult, diluc in everything, mona, keqing, etc.


It doesn't matter how many characters are designed to be greedy main carry like Razor/Klee/Childe/Noelle and how much don't.

You said that Mihoyo doesn't balance characters for carry role and that's the intended way to play characters is to constantly quick swapping them. Which is clearly false. Just because there are not many main carries doesn't mean behind the ones we have isn't a clear design and balance decision by Mihoyo.


Now I kinda want a fat teenager 3 star mixed in with all the 3 star trash  weapons we roll 90% of the time.

C6 unlocks dash, sprint and jump.


Hey don't be like that. Every tier is viable. That character is someone's favorite out there.


>in coop without some hard CC.

thatswhy I wrote "  in coop without some hard CC". When you can bring only 1 character, others might not bring Venti/Sucrose. In single its not as much of as issue - while ure charging enemies arent being hit and yeeted anyway.


They showed a screenshot. The only thing that confirms is that she’ll appear in the story. The 1.1 patch trailer showed gameplay of every new character that was made available in the patch. There’s no reason to think they didn’t do the same with today’s trailer.


> Quite unsure how having around 600% (Talent 7) elemental spammable damage (370% out of it is AoE) on it's charged attack is not VERY VERY strong.

Certainly glad you added that bit at the end about it being from the beta because I was about to bring up the whole entire Zhonglo ordeal. This is why I'm telling people to wait till Ganyu proves herself:

>https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/kb1vxr/new_character_demo_ganyu/gfeclzh/

We don't know if her being plain will be offset by her being good or not and using two busted characters as an example just doesn't work.

Bows are only good on keyboard and mouse. Sorry, there are plenty of hard hitting melee in the game as is for me to bother to sit down and be absolutely on point with charge attacks for those to mean anything... Plus they're useless during co-op when enemies are being ragdolled and randomly teleport when juggled.

Tavish Finnegan DeGroot?


Tavish Finnigan DeGroot, that medieval map we play on is technically his. He lives in a mansion and has a historical landmark that he invites the rest of the mercs to play knights storming his castle.


His name is Tavish. He's Scottish


his full name is Tavish Finnegan Degroot. he was born in Ullapool, scotland


 Tavish is the Anglicised form of Thàmhais, a vocative form of Tàmhas or Tammas, both Scottish forms of Thomas.


Demo made 45 million dollars in todays money. Adjusted for inflation obviously


First name is Tavish


Reddit vs Google


Ya kno for being the goofball losers of the merc world, Team Fortress be making some SERIOUS money


It's Tavish Finnegan DeGroot.

Why did you even ask for this on Reddit. Just Google it


i swear people talk a lot about ungrateful children, but rarely we talk about ungrateful parents, some of them really are problematic


Tavish DeGroot.

Yes, the keep is his, or his family's.

And yes, one of those three jobs is implied to be brewing.

Tavish Finnegan DeGroot


Tavish, she says it right in that panel.


I would like to think that Mrs.Degroot was actually upset that demoman wasn't happy trying to get a lot of jobs and was trying to make him feel bad enough to stop working those jobs and find other ones in her own way, I say this because she gets super happy after demoman gets his old job back thanks to ms.Pauling


his full name is Tavish Finnagen Degroot (not sure about exact spelling)

The real question is what are Demoman's other 2 jobs?


Tavish, the gaelic form of Thomas, similar to how Sean is the gaelic form of John. Perfectly reasonable.


I am more interested what are his other two jobes


What do you think his other two jobs are.


What comic is this


Tavish Finnegan DeGroot.


Demo


Clearly it's Uncle Ruckus (no relation).

Yeah it’s tavish finnegan DeGroot


[removed]


I always thought his middle name was Vinegar


Demo man is groot confirmed


yup


If me and the bois could go and storm a real castle for fun, that would be hype af. Idk why. Just the idea he does that sounds really funny. The mercenaries from blu and red having a day off to fight at Demo's Castle.


It's also why they're limited to medieval weapons, because modern weapons would damage his house.


Demo doesn't really invite them there


Soldier just angered a magician


ey me lads! Come down to me castle we can play knight!

 Er uh, those real weapons?

 Er uh, did you just kill scout?


So basically, hes the axl low of tf2?

Really annoying to play against, but the characters is the mist chill dude on earth

He's a Kenyan Scotsman.


Did somebody say Scott the Woz


He's also one of the few mercs we know the full name of, and the only one with a confirmed middle name.


Doxxed


Ullapool is a confirmed shithole


O so that’s why It’s called the Ullapool Caber


Aww I love demoman so much.


So if Tavish is Thomas does that mean Tav is Tom? Any Scottish people here? Do you know anyone called Tavish and dk they go by Tav for short


So it was "Scottishized" from Thomas to Thàmhais (I'm assuming Thomas was Anglicised from the Latin earlier in time), then *re-Anglicised* from Thàmhais to Tavish?


Dude I thought canonically the tf2 mercs were bottom of the barrel now do they get paid so much


They are DEFINITELY not investing wisely either I reckon. 

Well, having a mansion isn't that bad an idea I guess. Hmm... Any other merc investments we know about?


Obviously youre new here


Who's joe?


It's demonstration man, actually


*Finnegan, but nice try. \^_\^


Tavish is Tom in Scottish so Tom Scott lmao


the only ones without names are pyro and spy. there's Jeremy, Jane Doe, Mikhail, Dell Conagher, Ludwig, and Mun Dee Mundee


she'd probably beat him if he wasn't lol


Why did this make me laugh


Its Because he's home with his mother.


You can have 26 jobs too if all of them only need like an hour of work per week

Or if you own your own company and just assign yourself to 26 made up positions

I think the whole Gravel War has no one actually dying and it's just mercs taking contracts from both RED and BLU, while faking the killings.

Even the Administrator knows, but as long as it lets the war keep on going, she won't mind.


A paintball field I used to ref at for a few years had a castle siege set up. It was pretty awesome and easily our most popular field besides the speed ball set up.

Also had a ~~dieppe~~ Normandy beach Siege, with bunkers on the ridge, tank busters on the “beach” and landing ships complete with the stupid doors that just drop down to enemy incoming enemy fire. but in three years I only saw that one get used too potential once. (To be fair it’s extremely expensive for both the field and players to pull that one off as a “fun” experience.)


That's just a HEMA tournament.

Dell Conagher?


Yes, Ullapool is a hole full of shit. No wonder everyone there is good at making things explode.


I don't think Tavish is really that popular of a name. In the "People" section of the Tavish Wikipedia article there are only two listings, and one of them's Demoman. The other's a Scottish politician named Tavish Scott.


I'm Scottish and have never met anyone called Tavish


that’s linguistics baby


Heavy has to pay for his 12 seconds of gun fire somehow, engi needs funds for his inventions, medic needs funds every time he wants to make a new affront to God and spy has every luxury item like suits, watches, cars and such.

There is probably some exploitations with the stupider ones like scout "I could do this for money, I dont, but I could", but in general yeah they are making bank


Idk man then again demolition experts get paid big money



>  get payed so  
    
Did you mean to say "paid"?

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Pushing a wooden payload cart full of plague-infested Red Team corpses into their fortress.

Edit: I've just remembered that this is actually part of the Team Objective game mode on Chivalry, it's really fun.


The payload would be a really shitty trojan horse that is very clearly a bomb


That would be cool


That sounds fun


GROND


Payload should be a siege tower that is the only way to access the enemy spawn


There actually is a Workshop map called [Morrigan Alley](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Morrigan_Alley) that is a Medieval Mode version of a Payload map!


so the first half of cp_helmsdeep

Demo: Alright laddies! (drinks the whole bottle of scrumpy) It's on!

Thousands of battle cries soar to the skies, and the medieval battle begins.


I love imagining what these guys do on break. I like to think that scout and sniper shoot the shit for a bit, scout annoying him and him being too old for this shit.

Heavy and medic doing their thing, maybe chess or just enjoying company over tea.

Maybe even the spies from both sides meet up and do whatever it is spies do when they’re not infiltrating.


They kill other people too a lot of unnamed background characters.


Oh, no, the ‘deaths’ are real.  They just have a respawn chamber they’re linked to.


Yeah but thats demo's, he can blow it up anyhow he wants


*Slices Scout’s head off*

“That’s a joke, lads.”


Yeah, when Valve put the map out, their explanation was that Soldier pissed off Merasmus, so Merasmus warped the Mercs back in time.


***SO!***


They got more >!feckin' sea monsters in the great Loch Ness!< than they got the likes of me

Munty Mun-dee


They said “one of the few”. Idk what you’re questioning, unless you’re saying there’s a middle name in there somehow.


The only "good" part is the first three rows of houses. After that there's a tescos surronded by sharp metal fencing and a junkyard (last time i checked there was a replica of a sea mine for donations and i will replace it with a real one so nobody has to visit that shithole anymore)


And yet somehow the Ullapool Caber can barely even do THAT half the time LMAO


travish scott


scout spent all his money on Tom Jones merchandise believing it would only grow in value


Pyro burns the money and lives in a ditch, TELL ME HE DOESN'T.


Good bot


Sniper probably knows what he’s doing in investing


the good ending


cringe.


yeah i listed them all off in order of the class selection screen if you're curious about who's who


The enemy team gets poisoned when nearby.


It just has a spray-painted on "HORSE" that's spelled wrong and was very clearly written by scout.


GROND


Sounds oddly reminiscent of Splatoon's Tower Control gamemode where there's a moving tower you have to stand on.


It was part of the old community made Medieval update, which featured a bunch of cool weapon and hat reskins. It even featured Ye Olde Proppe Pack.

I also had quite a few laughs with the story given in the update's storybook format, such as Sir Paulington and his present company encountering The Heavy (who is minding his own business), and immediately resorting to Trench Warfare until said Heavy politely asks to join them.


Actually yea fair enough.


Nah. Battering rams would make more sense. It could also be how the Blu team could get into the Red base.


A trebuchet is a type of catapult.

And maybe use of a mangonel or onager - or battering ram - is warranted; do we really want a 300+m *medieval* map? I can't help but feel like Degroot Keep with a trebuchet would be either a BLU auto-win or BLU needs to *move away* as they're too close.

*Then again*, having a large Medieval Mode map would give an excuse to give the Engineer some sort of "medieval teleporter"; I could see it being a device (a stable, a catapult, a Targe-on-a-stand?) that just gives you a Targe Charge-like speed boost (complete with poor turning controls) that you can end at any time but gives no crits, no shield-bash, and no time limit.

"rescued paz"


GZ had a lot of uncomfortable allegories and emphasis on missions being recreations of important events. The idea of GZ being the VR or mind training The Medic experiences during the 9 years is downright fascinating.


How many people have 100% it?  There's real value in that but not the original retail price.


Wasn’t it supposed to be part of the main game then got pulled out at sold separately because MGSV was taking too long to come out?

That’s what I remember reading at least.


THEY PLAYED YS LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE


Deja Vu is the best fan service I have ever had in a game.


It was meant to leave you with a sense of Ground Zeroes.


And it ended up being more fun than the main game. Camp Omega is one my favorite levels in the series. Hard mode also helped balance the game (you have to mod it into the Steam version).

I also liked the Anti-Air and Assassination missions.


Don't ever play the Hitman games I guess


I sunk 30 hours into that game and loved every minutes of it, so to me it was absolutely worth the price I paid.


I get it's the same map but so is mgsvtpp. I only paid 40 though so maybe that's why I'm not a bothered by it. I replayed this more that I have tpp tbh.


Also all Konami's call.


eh never cried or whinged about it, was super happy and pumped to get it and no regrets and still replay it time to time. Brilliant fun. 100% it also. It was not that expensive, digital or physical copies. Sure if you are a kid with no job or from a 3rd world country in which Ill be asking what you doing with a playstation and hd tv then. Its pocket change


I think i might actually have more hours on ground zeroes than in phantom pain


PP should have been 20 camp omega sized maps


At its original $40 launch price it was a very hard sell. It's a fun "demo" with some solid level design. >!The maps in TPP are better!<.


You might even say… They played us like a damn fiddle…


GZ > PP


I’ve had a combined 50-60 hours on both PS3 and PS4 versions. Both have 100%.

I bought the PS3 version at full price for 40 bucks, and my PS4 version came with the Definitive Edition at 5 bucks.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, the replayability is there if you want it and look for it. There’s also some nice non-achievement related exhibitions you can do with the game, just some MGS gameplay shenanigans.

Having said all that good stuff, however, there is absolutely no way I’m justifying the full price on release.


It was my first PS4 game so I didn't even care. Played that thing over and over trying out different tactics. Super fun game. Overall I think I liked it more than Phantom Pain.


Isn’t it like 15-20 bucks now?


You can play as cube snake and goofy Raiden


Now get rid of the body snatchers and find all the MGS 1 flashbacks.

I platinumed this game pn PS4 and then again on PC. Gotta say the first time was more fun. But it's still a good sandbox with AI that blew my mind at the time.


I thought this was PW till I read the caption


Wasn't ground zeros supposed to be part of V to begin with? Then Konami asked it to be chopped up?


I bought it at full price, didn’t regret it.


Ground Zero was what today we know as a dlc, but before the game was out. It's weird. Had it been like an extra playground area dlc, I don't think people would have still been mad about it.


And somehow far superior to TPP…


Wow I’ve never seen this take before. What a mind blowing revelation and a great observation.


I got platinum in this demo


I like that one op where you have to extract Finger and that other guy before they leave the map, and the game will still say they left even while [they're tranq'd unconscious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhtD354lu40). 🤣


In the same map.


"rescued chico"


Yeah. Instead of being buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Cuba, she was instantly cremated and had her ashes scattered into the heartless sea. I see this as a total win


Wait what? I’ve not heard that theory before but that’s actually pretty fucking cool.


Thats what ive always thought i didnt know it was a actual theory


makes the rumor from the alleged konami employee leak sound more plausible, the rumor being that you were supposed to play GZ as a flashback right after rescuing kaz in afghanistan.


As someone else who has 100%ed the game too, I agree. But I wanted to mainly say that the original price was 40 dollars for those who thought it might have been 30 or 60.

Edit: Turns out I forgot the price drop was before release, and overly complicated because 40 dollars was only for the PS4 and Xbox One versions. PS3 and 360 always cost 30, which is still a bit much in most gamers' opinions. https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/25/5445626/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-price-cut-ps4-xbox-one-phantom-pain-dlc


I did back when it first came out on the xbox 360. 

Haven't bothered to 100% it again on ps4 or xbox one lol.


30 bucks for the current version of gz would have been fine, however the original retail price was kinda them going overboard, however if they made like a statement that it was meant for funding tpp I'm sure the public would have supported it. Back then many just considered it a dick move from Konami.


I don't remember if this was ever confirmed but there was much speculation about it.


IIRC Kojima recently revealed it was actually the opposite: GZ was always planned to be standalone and was part of an experiment in episodic game releases, but they decided to abandon that plan and TPP became a single game.


MGSV was too big for one game. Kojima wanted release it in three parts: Ground Zeroes, The Phantom Pain, Kingdom of the Flies. Third part was scrapped.


Konami was tired of the money being spent on MGSV so they pressured Kojima to release this $40 demo disc


Is MGS4 nothing to you?


Camp Omega had some *real* fun stealth play to it that you just don't really get in PP.  Of course there is some degree of stealth in PP but GZ was tip top.


You don't have to mod it into the Steam version, Hard mod is avalible by default


I've been seeing people say this alot. That GZ is vastly better and PP is just bad. I feel like people are just bitter about PP feeling incomplete. But then again I haven't played GZ so maybe it just is that much better.


Did hitman charge $40 for a single episode?


MGSV was too big for one game. Kojima wanted release it in three parts: Ground Zeroes, The Phantom Pain, Kingdom of the Flies.


Bro said that like DLC wasn't a common thing in 2015.


I say the camp was superly designed and the main mission is honestly my top fav main mission from mgs v alongside phantom limbs but in terms of pure gameplay fun i have to go with tpp. I was a damn pro in gz back then but tpp has spoiled me too much, can barely get an A on hard mode.


I wouldn’t say that Phantom Pain was entertaining to say the least >!except for the damn plague that just so happened to make EVERY SINGLE S rank soldier and above you had useless therefore fucking up run.!<


This is laughter of insanity


kid named finger


But map is great


Ok, done


A better map than V lmao


Wait what happens to Chico?


there are pieces of her teeth and bone inside of venom


Many people have speculated that the side-ops are basically what Medic is going through as his brain re-wires into BB’s memories. For example, the Finger and the Eye mission is a real operation BB did, it just didn’t take place at Camp Omega.


That’s still ridiculous for the amount of content in it imo. No other studio could charge that for that little gameplay


actually in france and europe it was released at 69.99€ .. two mounth later they put a discount and i had it for 10/20 euro ( thats actually expensive for a dlc of 6 mission on the same map)


Im pretty sure they dropped it to $30 before it actually released, and that was for physical. I think digital was cheaper.


I still see a lot of people comparing it to the Tanker mission in MGS2


That might have worked if they actually told the consumers that’s what they were doing.


Wish the staff at least made gz have the tpp's movement system but by then, i guess kojima was already on "vacation".


Yeah thats what I remember reading about it.  The budget for V was getting too crazy so Kojima had to release something early to help with the funding for the rest of it....  which was also never really finished


I actually have still yet to play it, so no spoilers, please!


If you’re talking about the repeated special missions, that’s different. The guards can barely see a few feet in front of them no matter what.

Edit: Why am I being downvoted? All I said was that I wish the game had a Hard mode where guards can actually spot you from further away, like in GZ.


GZ is just extremely solid and classic Metal Gear while PP which is also great but it veered pretty far from GZ mainly cause of the open world which meant PP wasn’t as tightly designed as GZ


i have 100% completed both GZ and TPP and i vastly prefer the feel GZ had going for it. Infiltrating an actual facility with multiple routes of entry is way more fun than running in the open between a bunch of disjointed outposts. Obviously, GZ is not a full game so i can’t say it’s “better” than TPP, but i can say i wish TPP was more like GZ.


They're exaggerating when they say TPP is bad, but Camp Omega in GZ really does feel a lot more grandiose and epic than the smaller locations in TPP.


GZ had such an amazing vibe, infiltrating a nicely built facility like that was just not a main part of the Phantom Pain gameplay loop.


$10 was pretty reasonable for how much replay ability there is in a Hitman map.


man I wish he did now


The only one that compares is OKB Zero


Holy hell dude I don't even wanna respond to the people giving you their examples if they just hate on you for having a popular opinion, if anyone actually wants to listen to what i have to say about the tpp maps ,  know that all those maps and yes even okb are nowhere as diverse and closely packed as camp omega whose various dips in geometry gives the place some character. They are meant for a less challenge but a more approachable and experimental type infiltration which of course is ok, no one is hating on the game , just that it could have more facilities packed in and wasn't so flat.


-50 lmao what a trashcan sub. I love MGSV, but you’re all kidding yourselves if you think a lot of not much is better than one well designed base. I’d kill for there to be anything even half as fun as Omega in MGSV.


Dies in the crash, according to a Kaz tape in MGSV


Soldier named finger


Not just that but the characters of Finger and Eye appear to be directly based on Kaz and Big Boss (their look, how Finger sounds, and the biggest thing is that their names switch between GZ and TPP)


BB? Keep on keepin' on! 😜


That sounds cool but the main problem is the entire overarching point of that plot detail is the implication that the games you - the player - played, are the missions as Venom experienced them, and they were so accurate that Venom was an accurate enough copy to fool nearly everybody.

There's nothing distinct about Ground Zeroes other than some of the wording used seeing as it was written in light of that plot point- Snake Eater, PO, and PW as you played them are the same thing: "recreations" so close to the truth that it doesn't matter.


i could think of a few


Red Dead Redemption was just rereleased, not remastered or anything, for $50 last week


Have… have you looked at the state of the gaming industry?


That’s why I never played it, I remember seeing a new metal gear game on the store, then saw the price, wondered why it was only $40 and basically everything I read was saying it was a glorified demo they were charging for. It wasn’t that long ago you could get all kinds of free game demos on Xbox and PlayStation, so to be told they’re charging more than half the asking price for the full game, for a demo? Hard pass.


I was pissed about it at the time too... as anyone should have been. But I did have to admit that I bought Xenogears 2 with absolutely no interest in playing it, because it came with a demo for mgs2.


Let’s see: 

Ground Zeros: 7 hours / $30 = $4.3 per hour

The Last of Us 1: 14 hours / $60 = $4.2 per hour

The pricing wasn’t nearly as egregious as people made it seem. In 2014 it wasn’t the norm for games to last 30-60 hours like they do now, and I would expand on quality over quantity but that’s ultimately subjective.


Then we all bought the phantom pain anyway…


metal gear rising was like 4 hours long and cost 60 dollars at release


I didn't know that. I guess we got lucky in North America then.


The 30 dollar price cut didn't happen until a bit after release I think, and I believe it was to match the price with the digital version? It's been almost a decade at this point, and I didn't get the game on launch. Waited until a nice Christmas discount and got it for less than 20 iirc.

Edit: Nope, was wrong. https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/25/5445626/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-price-cut-ps4-xbox-one-phantom-pain-dlc


I think they had already abandoned the plan before GZ released.


And actually let Kojima finish his work before releasing it lol


Snake and ocelot kiss.


I mean, doesn’t V contain an unhealthy amount of mgs4 spoilers? Unless you completely avoid the cassette tapes


Because the only game you mentioned was GZ. If you meant for that comment to refer to TPP, you have to *actually say that*.


I know it's a bit of a meme to say this, but Groznyj Grad (mgs3) would be amazing in a GZ style.


If only ground zeroes controlled as well and had the tools of phantom pain


OKB Zero, Nova Braga Airport, the Soviet Afghan Base, and Luftwa Valley/Mansion are some of the only places I can think of where the infiltration felt reminiscent of Ground Zeroes


It’s not called camp omega.


Same. I love both, but aside from a few similarities, they are two different types of stealth games. And when I played GZ I thought V was gonna be an MGS1/2 style game on PS4 and I was pretty fuckin hyped for that.


I thought Paz became Colonel Campbell?


I remember the fan theory that Chico became transgender and became Quiet.

I always thought BB in Death Stranding was a reference to Big Boss


Yeah but rdr has like a ton of shit in it


Please name an example of a game that costs $40 for as much gameplay as ground zero has


It was definitely a much bigger game than any demos you'd download on those stores.  Most demos would give a quick intro level and you game would last maybe 20 minutes?  Ground Zeroes was a compact experience with a fair amount of content for being the one map.


*Zone of the Enders


Last of us also had a decently sized multiplayer (if your code worked) keep in mind


It was $30 at release


What's the opposite of a spoiler?


I don't know. I didn't play it yet!


I’m glad the story of 3 is gonna be one to one I think the story for metal gear should generally stay the same for Delta but I hope they take some ambitions with the gameplay like what you said about Groznyj Grad


Mfinda Oil Field is pretty great.


Nova Braga and OKB Zero were my favorite as long as you don’t try to play them on free roam since like 0 guards would spawn. Luftwa Valley just felt too easy most of the time, but I usually went through the back door so idk


That was retconned in Survive


But wait, if Paz became Colonel Campbell, then who was codec???


oh lord i remember that. those were bad times.


"fan theory"


well, no, Bridge Baby

kojima just likes alliteration


Capcom released Resident Evil 3 Remake at full price and it’s like a 6 hour game.


Scorn?


Halo 3: ODST


The DLCs for Total War Warhammer 3


The new Modern Warfare games?


Thanks! I almost looked it up because I couldn't really recall, but figured if I was wrong it would just further illustrate my point. Lol


TLOU was just a quick example, but that’s a fair point. I loved Factions back then.


You're right, I found an article backing it up. I didn't get it until almost a year later like I said, so I never spent the 40 dollars on it. https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/25/5445626/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-price-cut-ps4-xbox-one-phantom-pain-dlc


Now I see why everyone hates it. I knew I was missing something! If that retcon wasn't in Survive, it'd be far and away the best Metal Gear game, in particular due to Kojima's odd desire to ditch everything we knew and expected and deliver an awkwardly different experience. Very bold of him!


The Codec was The Pain from Metal Gear Solid 3, remember?

He's an acrobatic beekeeper who interrupts himself because he can't help but show Snake his moves, and he's so excited about having a Tommy Gun he gleefully shouts about it before equipping it. Oh, and he shoots hornets from his body that sound like WW2 fighter planes.

That's Codec!


Yeah. MGS theory crafting had some high highs, and some low lows.


Fair I guess but that's not triple A


is this a joke? lmao


Nope, the single player campaign in them is pretty short, you probably get more play time out of the side ops in GZ.


They have a multiplayer element that is way more content than GZ offered. You can't neglect the MP, that's part of the price tag


You not only CAN, but have to if you want to really compare any game.

Multiplayer doesn't have an end state, which means you could say "but what if I replay GZ over and over?" as a counter argument. As far as the single player experience is concerned, you get more content out of the 40$ base price of GZ than the 60$ base price of CoD:MW.

You could also argue that since CoD is an extra 20$, that's the cost for the multiplayer.


After finishing the demo I texted my friend she could be up there with Kefka and Sepiroth. She killed her entire family and betrayed her people for ambition.


After that scene revealing Clive's mother's betrayal, I was really sad and angry, then I pictured Jack Garland using soul burst on her and it made me feel better lol.


I'd understand the hate if Clive is adopted or bastard, but it seems to me that Clive really is her own child only hated because not chosen as the phoenix dominant


Damn that got pretty dark’ but is Joshua really dead? Phoenix us the summon of fire and rebirth  and he is on the cover of the game so I’m guessing he has to be around in some form.


In Clive's words, I'll fucking kill her.


I have never hoped to kill a character more in any Final Fantasy game.


Where as Clive's dad is awesome? "I'd rather sleep fully clothed than have sex with you after you bad mouthed our son"


She kinda bad tho


I can’t wait for this bitch to die in the final release


She’s a bigger bitch than Walburga Black.


U got that right. I hope she gets wats coming to her in the story. She will either get killed or suffer.


it was common with fake marriages back in medieval time and people using women as pawns for alliances or "fake alliances".

Heck, Date Masamune the legendary Daiymo his mom was sent over to Date as a peace alliance, she literally poisoned her son who took over the Date Clan and tried to kill him at one point before she fled back to her home clan, Mogami.  They later made up when she was in her 70s and wrote that she would be homeless since she lost her influence in the mogami clan and Masamune let her move back with him in his castle.

anyway based on the letters with mogami you can tell she planned to kill her husband and their son at some point she was a spy/assassin pretending to be a loyal wife/mother for the date. people can call her evil, sick, whatever, but she did it for her clan and trying to protect her own people.


We should write a song about it. Similar to Cartman’s song about kyles mom 😂


The fact that she birthed both Clive and Joshua and that she had such contempt for their lives as only utilities is absolutely heinous

Like goddamn


She hot though


They really wanna make her like Cersei


I knew she would play Cersei


I noticed something was going on between Clive and his mother. The look she gave him didn’t seem very happy.

It was a very weird moment.


I wanna hate fuck her


Yeah, pretty much. Like holy shit, mate.


Demo was awesome!


She probably treated Jill like shit too wouldn’t surprise me if shes the one who had her enslaved and given to the iron kingdom


sorry if a bit unrelated but wasn’t Clive the other um Ifrit guy?  That was my understanding until afterwards it’s implied he wasn’t…I was thinking he did get the power after all and then lost control?


Poor Clive I wanted to hug him. His mom sucks and I hope we get to kill her. Lol


Yeah I already hated her after her blatant, visible disdain for Clive and her obsession over status and roles of importance when it comes to respecting or valuing others. But seeing as she betrayed everyone I honestly hope she dies terribly later in the game.


Can I just say: people really need to stop spreading the false notion that Clive is a bastard child. That is all.


Yeah, I actually started singing this song in my head once I realized what she did. Clive needs five minutes alone in a room with her.


she really wasnt a "bitch" when you look back, seems like she was  loyalist for her home nation and basically sent there to wreck havoc on this nation- probably to protect her own.

How dare you say that about my best girl 😡


Why did I click that. I need to unsub this sub cause I'm too stupid to not click even though it has spoiler warnings


Is she the same as Garudas host? Looks pretty similar to me


A little too much. Never dug the outright black villain in dark fantasy with soldiers that casually stabby stab whoever. I felt like the captain in the end was smiling under his helmet.

Why kill her handmaids? She could have just not brought them which means she brought them just to be a bitch and off them.


Yup... with the dark, messed up themes in XIV they've done it's no surprise the same team amped it up to 11 here.  They're pulling no punches with this.  

Aside from the horrible pacing which the flowing combat makes up for, I think I could invest some time in this game and see it through.  It has my attention for sure.


Didn’t enjoy the ending. Was such a waste of time. I beat the eikon yet he wins in the end. Hate that kind of story telling.. the boss fight wasn’t worth it and so unnecessary


[deleted]


When I first saw her, I figured she's not clive's mother


She's actually not Clive's real mother.

&#x200B;

Clive was born from another woman (who's ancestral bloodline houses Ifrit).  Which is why the queen hates him.


my brother and I literally sang this during our playthrough.


From what I understood from the demo is it can only be one fire summon. If that’s the case then my question will be: Where did Ifrit came from? Clive wasn’t supposed to have summon ability.


I think she knows Eikons powers consume their host, she wanted to protect her child, and not just use him/his powers for the people like his father, so he is still alive under her wing. But this is just a guess, we will see on 22.06


She’s cartoonishly evil I can’t take her seriously


So many dying characters. I luv it. I hope it continues. Fack that one death in FF7. Let's just go full GoT and murder main characters left and right.


At first I thought she wanted joshua locked up to be protected, but I suspect more and more it was to not use up his "powers" and drain himself before they could kidnap him.


"What if cersei didn't care for her kids"

Scary tought. Let's see how it pans out.


i died when elwin rejected her


I wonder if the boss fights will be in the order the trailer shows them after phoenix titan etc


This do be facts


Tha huzzy... I hope she screamin


Literally so true.


Agreed. Just wish demo hadn’t ended right than and there.


Came here to make sure this was already posted. Thank you


she bad af tho


Can't turn off motion blur. Bad game.


Keep in mind, she didn’t betray “her” people. She’s from the Empire and only cares for Royal blood. The only thing that was of any value to her was Joshua.


She is Cercei Lannister tier.


So far my biggest bugbear with the story is it's like....really?  Nobody saw this coming?  She's done everything but outright scream from the rooftops that she's not to be trusted.


I dunno. She's so unbelievably evil that it seems forced. It feels cartoonish.


She’s not even a step-mom either. Clive came out of her and she wants nothing to do with him. Stone fucking cold.


I can't wait to deal with her.


Clive's mother:"Joshua was the only thing i ca--"   
Garland " I don't give fuck!" Soul burst


"You will die at the hands of our empire, you mongrel"

Jack: "I knew you'd start spouting bullshit the moment I saw you."


Linkin Park intensifies


I love that tbh. Makes her that much more despicable and shallow.


I also read somewhere that Clive not being the dominant led to rumors that Anabella cheated on Elwin, which she resents.


I think she is projecting her own perceived failure onto Clive since he was the firstborn having no Eikon. That initial "failure" to produce a suitable heir along with her emphasis on noble blood is a double whammy on Clive.


Yes, it seems most people thought Clive was a failure when Phoenix didnt pick him, but he earned the respect of everyone but his mother


Yeah she was just power thirsty and desperate to continue living as royalty. 

Clive not being a dominant and Joshua being frail, she feared the kingdom would eventually collapse and she seemed to openly resent Clive for it. 

Probably the only reason she married Elwin in the first place was the promise of the first born being the true heir.


A lot about her reminds me of r/raisedbynarcissists . I hope a castle falls on her soon.


cause he was chosen by the other 1 it seems


I thought Clive was adopted at first cuz his hair was nowhere near his mothers then I saw the archduke and there it was.


You would think adopted or bastard is the only reason to hate your kids

Sadly, there’s a whole lot more! Like not inheriting good genes or because they were forced to have you


He's a basted in her eyes. Just like dawves


we haven't seen a body yet. so there's hope i guess.


Yeah, the dominant of the Phoenix of all things is like the last person in the world i will believe to be dead without seeing the body. ANd knowing the CU3 writers, even WITH a body i would not really count them out yet...


When the >!screen went dark as EEEEFREEEEET was tearing away at the body, and all you heard was clawing and Eikon flesh being torn and ripped and crushed... and to think it was a small child in the body of the bird that was experiencing that......!<, it was really disturbing.....


Nah, the Phoenix is mostly known to revive. I guess Joshua is alive. Also we saw in the trailers that the Phoenix is still there.


It’s possible but if he is it won’t be discovered until after/during the mission you go on with Cid to get a dominant from Benedicta that you do during the eikonic challenge option from the main menu.


Either he’s in some hibernation state (maybe even within Ifrit after he ate the fire), he survived and just went underground (maybe even really underground if he fell down), or he was secretly taken by the emperor against the mom’s knowledge.


Unlikely considering he's the Phoenix, plus we've seen gameplay of Phoenix fighting another particular winged Eikon the Phoenix itself is at least around in some form.


Considering how Joshua is the Phoenix and we still haven’t seen the face of the young man in the hood from the demos and trailers, I have a strong feeling Joshua “died” only to be reborn shortly thereafter.


Same, i was fuming after that demo. June 22nd can't come any sooner.


He gives off "good guy up front- did some shady things in the past" vibes.

&#x200B;

I have a strong feeling his father was also up to some bad shit.


NO. She must suffer


Probably why she hates Clive. She was probably sent to produce a dominant and capture it for the empire. Clive was probably a failure for that plan. She isn't even sad about her favorite son dying; just disappointed and upset.

I'm getting heavy loyalist brainwashing vibes from the empire.


That’s… That’s the joke of the post


It is pretty ghetto.


Worse. Cersei was never horrible to her kids; for the most part she was only horrible to other people.


Cersei is a saint compared to her


I was assuming she's not his actual mother given how she looked at him compared to Joshua, but I could be wrong it'd be worse if she's his mother and did that


If you wanna be her lover, ya gotta be her cousin


She does, if you read her Active Time Lore entry


Clive is the Dominant of Ifrit. We don't know yet if the Ifrit we saw fighting the Phoenix was Clive or Clive being controlled.  
From what was given from the combat demo, it seems like Clive doesn't recall anything that happened during that fight with Ifrit and Phoenix so we'll see where that goes in the story on the 22nd.


That’s not what it describes in the Active Time Lore.


That is what we in fire bird culture call a "bitch move."


Your best girl can die by Ifrit's hellfire


You should unsub now, there’s just gonna be more spoilers if Reddit has taught me anything it’s either be up to date or get spoilt


Nope. They may both come from sanbreque though.


Why is a question being down voted?


No, that one is Benedikta, and she's closer in age to Clive.

Also doesn't seem to be 100% heartless evil and narcissistic like Anabella.


I believe she brought them to care for Joshua and killed them bc they were no longer necessary. Earlier if you walk by her outside the castle she's scolding them that they have to take care of Joshua no matter what.


Her handmaids knew too much...its a leave no witnesses situation


I’m sorry, what horrible pacing is it you’re speaking of? The demo literally only basically serves to display the inviting incident of the story itself which is only a little drawn out by the inclusion of the visit to the swamp town. 

How can you say it has horrible pacing when there is literally no pace to the story yet?


The eikom is clive...or so I'm assuming. So it was a brother against brother fight.


I was about to defend you but... This is titled "After besting the demo..."


Fucking demo release day??? If you don’t want spoilers don’t look at this sub.


That would contradict her praising Elwin for staying true to family tradition (incest).


thaaaaaaaaaaat is definitely gonna be the central question of the game, or at least the first major section


Or perhaps where did Phoenix come from?

Maybe Ifrit is supposed to be the fire Eikon.  Phoenix could be something else entirely.


What is cartoonishly evil


Honestly I'm glad they ended it right there it left open for me to want to play more and play it asap. If they added more story progression I mightve felt less about it. Im not a big fan of demos that basically give you half the game to explore it takes away a lot of hype once its out.


Oh, but they need a way to drag you in! I feel the same way, but it was the perfect cliffhanger, imo.


She is also from the Phoenix bloodline, her and Elwin are cousins


That would mean that the Rosfields are all related to the Empire as her and Elwin are cousins


That would certainly be her logic


oh, I think I missed this. Was it in the ATL somewhere?


Im sorry maybe im just dumb but is it stated that shes from the empire? My understanding is shes from rosaria and was secretly working with the empire


Maybe not, but, at least from the demo's ending, she did sell her son into slavery. That is still incredibly awful.


Cersei is a b**** but atleast she loved her children.


Cersei at least acknowledged all her children and gave even the two youngest a modicum of love.

This bitch here isn't worthy to be called Clive's mother, lol


No I think the best (worst) comparison, is going to be Malty from Rising of the Shield Hero.


How could anyone suspect she'd throw away her marriage and her eikon-wielding king to be son so easily??? Why even invade if they are being pushed out of territory by the blight already? The invaders are completely separate from the army they were planning to war with, right???

I don't get sparing Clive, that's going to be interstate to see explained later in the story.


Believe it or not there are real people like this.  They're called narcissists.


I saw a lot of Lady Macbeth in her.


Exactly. It's like ppl don't realize plenty of birth parents are despicable to their own children, esp narcissist parents.


Except Clive is the Duke's mirror image, lol


I thought so too. But I think she straight up does not love her kids at all. She was only mildly miffed that Joshua died. However, Joshua was something useful so she took care of him. But if you noticed, Joshua balled his fist in her presence, so he also has no love her. I believe she wanted the phoenix dominant. Not necessarily Joshua. They just happened to be the same people. It's probably why at the feast he thought not one cared about him, only the Phoenix.


Except he does so can't wait until she sees that


Chosen by ifrit? Not sure they have prior knowledge to that. Murdoch was even surprised having another fire eikon when Clive transformed.


gave me some strong Evangelion vibes


But she is bad though ...


yepp, and speaking of the case above, masamunes mother felt he was cursed because he had smallpox as a kid and his face got deformed and she tried to get her youngest son to inherit the clan over him. I dont know ,I just got a Masamune history vibe here ;)


Incorrect. Cersei was a narcissist just like Anabella. She only likes her kids as long as they do as she says. The moment they show any tiny hint of independence she gets angry at them. This is far more evident in the books (the show watered her down to "but muh kidz" but it was still apparent).


Nah fuck that evil bitch


It says in the Active Lore thing that she's his mother.


That was my thought too. She might be his step mother.


Similar hairstyle I guess, between Clive and mumsie


Bet


there is footage of Clive fighting the eikon of fire with himself transformed as ifrit as well as in human form. they are connected. Somehow, they have to be two separate entities.


![gif](giphy|iJJ6E58EttmFqgLo96|downsized)

😡


Yep true! I'll be back at a later point! Enjoy the ride everyone! 🙌🏾


This sub downvotes everything that isn’t praise. Ask a simple question and you will get downvoted into oblivion.


I mean, they have some resemblance, and both look like manipulative bitches and a time skip in between


I know. That's what I mean by black almost comically evil. Unless they had brands too they would presumably be Empire citizens so it's not like they're going to tell.

So she did it just to be mean and didn't want to give them a carriage ride back lol. Always found that stuff corny more than it makes me hate the villain.


She was being viciously facetious.  

Part of the reason he pushed her off him.  And she gave him that stare.


See this is my question. Of the two, Phoenix is the odd one of the eikons as the only (known) non humanoid. Behamut is close as well which leads me to a creepy idea. What if the more animal like aspects of the eikons are evidence of incest within the dominant's line? Both of the direct kings (Phoenix and behamut) have more animalistic forms while the wanderers that washed ashore (titan and I think odin) have close to human forms. This also leads me to think Clive is similar to Garnet - switched at/near birth due to a death. Maybe a mistress? Only problem is he looks a lot like his mom.


Someone gave it to him if i had to guess.


https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cartoonishly%20evil


I just don’t like huge cliffhangers like that. Is it a great place to end the demo, yes. But I would’ve been happy with another mission or two.


Is she also Clive’s biological mother? I think it would add an extra layer of cruelty if she can’t even blame her cruelty on Clive not being her child.


Is that explicitly stated anywhere? I had that impression during their conversation when Elwin says something about Phoenix linage being in her blood or something along those lines, eve though the last dominant was his father


Is that why Joshua is frail? Incest? But I haven't beaten the demo yet so maybe there's another reason.


Is that explicitly stated anywhere? I had that impression during their conversation when Elwin says something about Phoenix linage being in her blood or something along those lines, eve though the last dominant was his father


Not necessarily. If she and Elwin aren't close cousins, it could just be her specific branch of the Rosfield family ancestor who was married off at some point in the past to secure an alliance with the Empire. However, this will certainly make both her sons related to the Empire through her, yes.


It gets worse.


Exactly. Cersei doesn’t love anyone but  her kids and her twin brother. I do not believe she would leave her kid on the ground like that. She would try to help him, remember she love Joffrey even though he is an ass. 
  The bitch in ff16 really makes Cersei look like a caring person. I actually think Cersei would consider someone that hates their children horrible.


Yet she had no problem using wildfire to explode Margaery sky high, knowing how much Tommen loved her and did not shed a tear when he jumped out of a palace window, with full intention of taking the crown for herself. Yes, she loved her kids, but not more than power and her own selfish agendas.


lol this fiction that Cersei 'at least loved her children' has got to stop. She only 'loves' them because they are still the 'spares' to Joffrey's 'heir'. If she can't use them to control the throne, you can bet your last donut she will sell them for max profit whenever.


I don't think she saw it as sparing.

Forcing the person you hate to be a slave, and forced to fight for your enemy. It's a fate worse than death for a soldier.


Well, we also don't know her motivations yet, so it could make more sense later. I feel like this is a good writing tactic. Make a character seem cartoonishly evil and then later reveal information that makes it make sense and even makes that character sympathetic to the audience. 

That being said, I don't think she is getting her redemption arc. She kinda feels like she is going to play a straight bad guy.


Well now I need an older, matronly woman in Clive’s life to act as a proper maternal figure. Everyone deserves a mom.


Elwin Rosfield - brown hair

Clive Rosfield - brown hair

Joshua Rosfield.. Blond hair.

(IK it's prolly becuz he's a dominant but I still think it's kinda funny)


It’s very clear that there’s something going on with Clive and the mysterious figures he sees.

It also wasn’t Clive that transformed if you look closely, but the fiery figure. 


but somehow Clive was able to ‘see’ the events of Ifrit killing Joshua from a third person, you can even hear Torgal in the background. With the same  camera ‘filter’ when Joshua speaks when he is in Phoenix. 

Intended forsure


I'm just guessing he was I mean that be why the other 1 didn't want him


First thing that came to mind


yeah, but she never wanted any of her kids straight-up killed like Anabella does.


Cersei had a modicum of love for them, especially Joffrey, Anabella doesn't even acknowledge Clive.


Yeah it's very clear in the books that Cersei sees her kids as an extension of herself and loves Jaime because he is her twin and she sees him as basically a second her. Her love for them is really messed up and contingent on them being one of her own.


She's not his real mother.  Guaranteed.

The active lore is keeping you in the dark based on what the player "should" know.

&#x200B;

Just like Clive not being a Dominant.  When he really is Ifrit.


Nope, she gave birth to him and everything, but since he didn't get fire bird powers, she ignores him.


Dead give away Joshua and Clive both look different granted in real life siblings don't have to look the same but this is game logic so I can say that


"Waddup fam. You looking fine af"


Perhaps they knew too much to release at this point


I one-hundred percent peg Clive as someone else's son.  He's not the queen's son.

Creepy theory indeed.  I do think that Phoenix plays a larger part than the Eikons do.  I think he exists outside of the natural battle of the Eikons.  He is everlasting after all.  Is Phoenix a good or bad player though?  That's the question.


The problem is than this happens in real life and much much worse. But if you live in a safe bubble you wouldn’t know.

Cartoonishly evil doesn’t really exist, invented by some gated westerners.

Even the example is laughable. If you think all activists are good or even care about it you have a lot to learn.

Psychopaths exist and they don’t know morals and ethics and even they get children they don’t give a fuck about.

What Annabelle did, didn’t even shock me, already read much much worse stuff happening in real life.


It’s implied she is, she scorns Clive for not inheriting the Phoenix.


Yes. Because “Phoenix passed over” Clive for Joshua, she considers Clive worthless. 

Elwin (the duke) brings up the fact that Phoenix passed him over, too, but she just brushed that off.


My first thought was it's the same dynamic as Catelyn Stark and Jon Snow but it seems not, she's just a bitch.


Yep, Active Time Lore


You think that she may want to become the Phoenix dominant herself?


>She’s from the Empire and only cares for Royal blood. The only thing that was of any value to her was Joshua.

It's probably because of Joshua's overuse of his healing powers similar to how Cid coughs up blood when he used his Eikonic abilities.


He's just sickly. It happens. But yes, it could be because of incest. The parents are cousins after all. But I think it's just one of those times when some kids are sickly.  Clive is the product of the same union but is physically strong.


I don’t know but it’s a possibility. When incest is involved the chance of not being fucked up in any way at all is very rare.


Yeah it straight up says in the active time lore they are cousins


Her reaction to losing her daughter and sons looked like real grief, and she mourned her first child with Robert as well. She is evil as hell but she's not tywin lannister, she cares for her kids.


She literally betrayed her kingdom, didn't shed a tear and was only disappointed at losing her useful son, enslaved her useless son, and then let men execute her servants. Not to mention how the father and Clive talk as if she's been a horrible person since he's been born. There's no way she gets any sort of redemption. Classic narcissist.


I respectfully disagree when it concerns her motives, I think it is pretty clear what her motives are, since Joshua is/was frail because of either his inexperience or his illness, she was probably going to have him installed as leader, and pull the strings of his leadership. But once Joshua outlasted his usefulness, she was going to kill him off and take on the mantle of leadership.

She just seems like she has a lust for power.


Tbf Joshua could’ve got the blonde hair from his mother


Murdoch and Clive was in the same place and Murdoch got barbecued after the transformation (maybe that poor chocobo too). I guess we will find out if Clive really can transform to Ifrit 9 days from now, can't wait!


Because all her kids are her ticket to power. Clive is not a ticket to power for Anabella. Cersei's thoughts about Tommen is basically "he can't catch a cold and die, because Myrcella is too far away for me to use to keep the throne".


As I said, she loves them as a narcissist does, i.e. if they give her what she wants, and Joffrey, as heir to the throne, is the means of allowing her to be the power behind the throne. That's also why Anabella "loves" Joshua (and yet notice how she barely cares when he dies except some casual remark about him being her world) but disregards Clive. If you've seen the show at all, Cersei basically mostly ignores Tommen when he was only the "spare" until Joffrey died, and then suddenly Tommen is her new golden boy... until he starts showing independence from her, and then her face turns completely black. All her claims about loving her children are just lip service to justify the crimes she commits to satisfy herself.


Well, I don't think the Active Time Lore information would lie to us. I expect it to omit information, but not give disinformation. If it says that she's his mother, I'll believe that. If she isn't, I would consider that the ATL was pooly worded. Unless it will be some kind of plot twist, then maybe the ATL will just share the information you think you know at the moment, I dunno.

Also, the ATL doesn't outright says that Clive isn't a Dominant, does it? It just says that he was rejected by Phoenix. And Clive could not be a dominant at that point, being possessed or something by Ifrit at the Phoenix Gate events. We still don't know a lot.


She's his real mother. Guaranteed. If you know anything about royal heir birthing at all, you'd know that it's always witnessed by plenty of midwives and handmaids and surrounded by celebrations etc. The whole point is to cloak the arrival of a new heir with a cloak of legitimacy to smooth their path to succession. The Duchess' pregnancies will be announced from the moment it's confirmed, as will be her confinements and labours. Her pregnancies (and by extension, miscarriages and stillbirths) are literally a matter of the state, no secrecy allowed. There is literally no way anyone would fail to hear about a royal birth.


She’s his mother guaranteed, I’m not sure why you’re making stuff up.


Ah i see. I stand corrected.


Instead he got fire dog powers and she ain' eeeeeen know it


[deleted]


That’s where my mind went.

It’s just that they know that she ordered the killings, so they can’t be left alive


A true nmom.


So this is why the ATL is so cool. Elwin was born before his dad (the dominant) passed away, meaning he never could have been the dominant. That’s why she says he did his duty in the bedroom scene.


I don't think she brushed it off considering she betrays him the next night lol. I think she just pretended it didn't bother her and secretly despised being married to him.


Phoenix didn't really pass him over though. It's just that he was already born before the last Phoenix died. So it seems implied that it's and every other generation type deal. But yeah, Annabell is a fucking monster. I'm sad because I doubt we'll get to end her personally.


Yeah, Cat at least desperately loved her own children, meanwhile Joshua’s mom doesn’t give a shit about 1/2 of her kids and even the death of her favorite child only seems to mildly annoy her.


Whoa, got a pic/video? All the streamers I've watched so far have been really lax with ATL.


Not really, she is just betting on the strongest, at all cost. She can still give birth to the Phoenix since she also has it in her blood, with Joshua "dead" and 2 timeskips (13 years for the first one), I can see a new kid in her life. We'll see


Isn't there something where being a Dominant can drain your life force the more you use it? I could see that being a downside for her.


I don't think that was from the abilities. That was from getting yeeted across the room and having a statue fall on him.


This actually isn’t true. 

The additional risks from incest is slight at just one generation. The problem is at multiple generations of incest.


Thanks, I like that mechanic but Im just finding out I missed some entries, like this one or the deity Jill prays too


Oh man, the one I watched didn't open that statement. Can you please share a link that shows their cousin infos? Since, I'm so very sorry to FF16 fans and FF fans in general out there, I can't afford this game, so I can only see it's story on Youtube.


Aye there's a fuckton in ATLs that I just constantly miss these details out.


It's a combo of grief for the loss of power and the showrunners massively watering down her narcissism from the books.


Only "redemption" she's getting from me is cutting her head off or having Ifrit toast her.


Hey, so did Itachi from Naruto!


I guess the Rosfield seed isnt as strong as the Baratheon seed.


>maybe that poor chocobo too).

It's only chapter one and there is already a dozen of on-screen chocobo violation.


.... I can't tell if you're joking.

&#x200B;

He took another woman secretly.  She had his son.

Everything else is a coverup so that the royal bloodline and perception of the royal family isn't seen as flawed.


Because he's another woman's son.  Count on it.  It will be revealed in the game.


Yeah, you're probably right


Yup. ATL is dope AF.


Yes! Lol she was like “ah! Got me there lol let’s change the subject”


So eventually she was gonna groom her kid and marry him, what could've been.


You're not getting boss-battle-after-she-transforms-into-some-eldritch-monstrosity-for-the-sake-of-power vibes?


That's a narcissist for you though, even her golden child won't matter to her when compared to herself. She would absolutely choose to sacrifice Joshua for her own gain is the way I read her.


I thought she would be furious at the death of Joshua. But she has the same level of annoyance as if she just lost a handbag. It was frankly chilling.


Right!? I can only count on the streamers and most of them don't seem to care about the ATL😤😡


He was already panting from channelling Ramuh's powers while mid-battling Benedikta though, before the statue fell on him.


I do think its from the abilities, we do see this in one of the trailers where they talk about the body decaying by channeling powers of an eikon or the crystals and cid seems to have been ramuh's dominant for a long time now


Which, given that it happened at least once and that we know she was apparently very concerned about their “noble blood,” one can probably assume that they are not the first Rosfields to get married in Alabama.


I think in the full game you will be able to look at the whole library, just not limited to the relevant details for the current scene.


Maybe but only Robert's and joffrey were killed yet in the books iirc.


I am literally not joking. If you know anything about royalty and royal births at all you'd know the births of heirs are STATE OCCASIONS. Just look at how the British royal family deal with royal pregnancies and the births of heirs even today. Royal pregnancies take place in full glare of publicity because the point is to project stability and longevity of the bloodline.

There are no secret princes because the point is to shout their births from the rooftop, and illegitimate children are not princes. Everyone acknowledges Clive as Anabella's "flesh and blood" and he is the firstborn prince of the realm, therefore, she went through the entire ceremony for royal births with him just as she did for Joshua.


She didn’t even care about Joshua dying, it was a mild inconvenience to her. Talk about being oblivious to the facts.


Huh????

Lol I didn't imply any of that! Bro is down bad 😭

She would probably pull a Cersei and try to rule through the kid and try to manipulate him.


Or she has another kid with someone else  in an attempt to create a Phoenix, and the kid kills her.


I'm more inclined to think she dies like Hera-in-GOW3 vibes.


Losing you favorite tool can be irksome, but at the end of the day it is but a tool. Joshua was simply a tool as well, it seems. So I don't think she had any love for any of her children. It's just that Clive was of no use to her, so she had no feelings but scorn for him. She sucks.


That’s nuts. I thought ATL was going to be so stupid, but then I used it in the middle of a couple of cutscenes to learn people’s names, since I play without subtitles, and I couldn’t believe how good it was


Yeah! This is where I kinda picked up that the more you use your abilities the faster the body decays. I just realized that the process is like nuclear decay lol makes sense since they're the FFXVI version of a WMD


Yea, medieval royalty and nobility basically intermarried each other for power and property for generations on end. Even if you take out the magical element from FFXVI (i.e. the Phoenix Blood), this still happened IRL and not just the Hapsburgs' level either.


Sure that's a given. I just thought it would be the same for the demo and I felt I was using active time too much so I tried to use it before the Marlboro fight, but it was nowhere to be found sadly


And her thoughts in the books was "Tommen can't catch a cold and die because Myrcella is too far away for me to control to keep the throne".


You're comparing British royalty to a fictional royal family.... based on medieval/feudal history. 

&#x200B;

British Royalty is barely what one would consider "royalty".  It's a fluff title in the most basic sense of the term.  Doesn't actually do anything.

&#x200B;

Based on writings from hundreds of years ago, a king taking other women and having bastard children was common.  Along with coverups.


Never said she was a good person :D


>!Well, ngl, I could see her going the incest route with Olivier.!<


Nah I can't see anyone becoming the phoneix dominant other Joshua because Clive himself still retains the blessings of the eikon even in Joshua's "death". There are possibly going to a revival story with the phoneix at the center somewhere possibly


That's what the 13 summers later is probably for so you can have an evil Half-Brother who looks like Joshua.


No clue why she spared Clive, though. As far as she knows, his kid could inherit the Phoenix instead of hers now.


Yeah it's better than a glossary in the back of the book like a lot of fantasy authors do nowadays


Wonder if that what makes Clive special


Very true. The most common one are first cousin marriages.


The archive is unlocked at the Hideout, so not till you get to that part of the story.


British royal family is one of the only European royal family left that still holds on to most of the "old ways". And if you read up on actual medieval history you'll find that coverage of royal pregnancies was actually EVEN MORE INVASIVE in medieval era. Look up the pregnancy and birth of Jane Seymour to Edward VI for example.

Did I not just explain that bastard children are NOT princes of the realm (e.g. Henry Fitzroy, bastard son of Henry VIII)? That you had to be legitimate to be a prince? Also, if the king took other women and had bastard children, literally everyone would know he isn't the son of the queen because almost every single second of her time is accounted for, and certainly her pregnancies will be extensively announced with no chance of a coverup. The point is to make sure the heir's right to succession isn't questioned, that's why everything has to be whiter than white, no coverups allowed.

You really have a problem with reading comprehension don't you?


I think she assumed he'd get butchered serving in "the front lines" (IIRC)


She didn't do it to be kind, but as a last act of revenge against her husband who always defended their son. "As my husband never tired of reminding me" etc.


Knowing he was about to be branded, it was probably expected he'd just like a life of suffering and die on the frontlines. I legit don't think branded have enough peace outside Rosaria to start a family.


\*cries in Malazan\* (iykyk)


There are stories with "princes" who are not born from the queen.  Yes, coverups.

Going to bookmark this.

&#x200B;

To come back to once the game reveals that he is, indeed, not the queen's son.

Oh, so that's why they had a bunch of jacked security guards in black suits at their business area booth at all times like they were guarding the president.


VGC also corroborating the Eurogamer report.

https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-showed-switch-2-demos-at-gamescom/

VGC corroborates the report that Nintendo showed off a demo of an enhanced BOTW with higher framerate and resolution (no indication that this will be a re-release later). 

VGC also adds that the Matrix Awakens Unreal Demo was also running on the Switch 2 with DLSS running comparably to the current gen consoles.


fyi back in 2016 Tom Phillips was the first writing in detail about the then upcoming new Nintendo console (NX) which was released as Switch. So they have a credible track record 

https://www.eurogamer.net/nx-is-a-portable-console-with-detachable-controllers

https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4uohsu/nintendo_nx_is_portable_console_with_detachable/


I assume that the use of “Switch 2” in the article means that the system will be very similar to the Switch’s handheld-home console hybrid design. 

If so, I’m glad that’s the case. Nintendo tapped into something great with the Switch’s use case and I don’t think there’s really any need to reinvent the wheel.


Instead of calling it Switch 2, I hope they give it some silly name to confuse people, like with the Wii and Wii U.

I would call it the Switch Up.


As long as they don’t make the Wii-U mistake and call it the Switcharoo or something, this is pretty much guaranteed to be successful. But again, the same should have been true for a Wii successor.


Makes sense if some dev kits are already floating around. 

Prime 4 being a (cross gen) launch title would be massive for both systems.


Honestly I can't wait. The steam deck and the bunch of portable "pcs" that came around it are interesting. But I still want to see what Nintendo can do with better hardware. The switch is struggling.


I don't care if they have to have 2 versions at launch and I pay a premium. Please launch with an OLED screen. 

I really don't want that to be held off so that they can launch an improved version a few years from now.


Unless it's a brand new name like Gamecube to Wii, naming your next console with something like "Pro" or "Deluxe" tends to confuse people.  I saw people confused with Xbox Series X which is totally different to Xbox One X but Xbox One is not referring to the original Xbox which people can call the Xbox 1.


If this is true then I’m kinda excited, I just hope it’s still handheld and has similar battery life to the current switch, but I kind of doubt that it will. If it did it would probably be pretty expensive


All I want is 1080p 60fps with their current graphics and art style. TotK legitimately chugs and has trouble keeping even 30fps. It's hard for me to play.


So it’s a given that it’s Nvidia hardware if it’s using DLSS.


What’s strange is Nvidia hasn’t really been making a lot of SOCs lately right? It’s only chips in cars these days, not so much tablets or devices anymore.


I'm very curious what launch titles might be. Smash coming out within a year of launch feels like it would be huge.


Wild that it's probably gonna be announced next year. It would be awesome if the graphic power is on the level of ps4 and Xbox one. Just hope whatever it is doesn't sacrifice battery.


You know I have a conspiracy theory about this system: does anyone think it’ll get RdR2 at or shortly after launch? The switch just got the first one and I wonder if that’s Rockstar seeing if the RAGE is compatible with Nintendo hardware.


After seven years of a new Switch Pro 2 Deluxe Extra X rumour each week I'll just wait for an official announcement at this point.


Still plenty of Joycons to sell, why stop now?


So does this mean I shouldnt pick up that switch OLED i was thinking about? But if they are only demoing to devs, then I figure it would still take till end of 2024 at the earliest.


> on hardware targeting the new console’s specs

So it wasn't a dev kit or even anything remotely resembling the final product. Makes sense if they want to avoid leaks, but a tech demo on cherry-picked hardware running in ideal conditions isn't really indicative of what will actually be released to consumers, especially since "specs" tell far from the whole story.


Battery life better be good. I could care less about teraflops or whatever if i can only play it for an hour


I can't imagine being excited for this when emulation exists, I won't waste an experience like Zelda in less than 4k.


so we can get a good looking Zelda game?


Should I wait for it or get an OLED version ? I'm dying to try TOTK but also want to get my money's worth


I don't really care if nintendo has to step up their game for high end hd AAA games or not, just give me a new switch that can run these chugging switch games I already own better please, it'd be nice to revisit TotK without dropping to 20fps half the time.


Imagine if Gamefreak hiring people for Unreal Engine has something to do with this... Maybe a Pokemon game in UE4-UE5? Imagine...


So realistically what could be the release window if they're just showing off to devs. Wouldn't that mean they don't have dev kits and haven't developed for it specifically? A lot of articles are saying 2024, but this just makes it sound like there's no games in development except of course for first party from Nintendo.


Maybe Biden had a hankering for some upgraded zelda


the Switch 2 is even more important than the president, arguably


Yeah I also thought that was suspicious. While they usually have some security around, this year they had one or two guards per door.


Comparable to current gen is a pretty huge leap.


No signs of the BOTW demo being a re-release because it's actually a demo for our previous Switch library running with better performance through backwards compatibility. 🤞


Dlss too overpowered.

Even if this only gets up to series S power in reality that's still really good for potentially nabbing multiplats.


You're trying to tell me that this is actually aiming to be at PS5/Xbox series X level?  They're actually trying to aim for graphics again like the GameCube?


> VGC corroborates the report that Nintendo showed off a demo of an enhanced BOTW with higher framerate and resolution (no indication that this will be a re-release later).

C'mon. This is Nintendo we're talking about. Half their business model is re-releases. I'd put money on "Breath of the Wild HD" being a launch title for the console at this point.


[deleted]


Bode very well for BC at launch. If it can take Switch games and improve them (even if it’s just framerate and res) that’s a strong selling point for current owners.


No indication of rerelease?

Hahaha all the switch games are gonna be rereleased with better frame rate and resolution, prob full price.


Nintendo might actually have taken it to heart that nobody takes them seriously for game development due to their outdated as fuck hardware ideology to cut costs.

If any of this is even close to true and the hardware at launch is at least close to these claims? Fuck me sideways Nintendo might fully get third party support back on their platforms and have something even *more magical* than the Switch initially was.

God damn. I'm actually excited to see what Nintendo's got cooking with this.


> VGC also adds that the Matrix Awakens Unreal Demo was also running on the Switch 2 

Makes perfect sense. If Nintendo doesn't have hardware that supports UE5, then you would only see "Cloud Edition" games for all AAA titles for the years to come.


The rumors always were that Nintendo was gonna do a Switch Pro with DLSS tech but covid/supply chain issues hit and they cancelled it. IMO makes sense they'd bring suped-up DLSS to the next Switch instead.


Let’s hope that if they do have enhanced versions of already released games they are just updates and not sold with the $60 price tags that never drop below $55…


It's funny to read some of those 2016 comments in that reddit thread, getting frustrated at the contradictory and wild NX speculations, not knowing they were only a few months away from the big reveal.


He's also reported on several things that were completely false...

https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-nintendo-switch-will-have-gamecube-virtual-console-support


Tbh I have no idea where they can go otherwise. Nintendo already merged their handheld and console divisions together. At the very least it had to have both handheld and console functionality. Maybe a small gimmick here or there but this could very well be the least iterative hardware Nintendo has put out in a while.


Apart from some developers, nobody knows the name of the next nintendo console or how it'll look like. For us mortals, Switch 2 is only a shorter version of "next nintendo console".

That said, there's no chance nintendo is going back to a TV-only console.


They've done this for many of their consoles. 2 iterations of a concept then it's out the window.

SNES was NES II (beginning)

GBA was GB II (1 screen handhelds)

3DS was DS II (2 screen handhelds)

Wii U was Wii II (focus on motion controls)

Gamecube was N64 II (Look we're 3D now!)

So I'm super curious what comes after Switch II


With how successful it is I can't imagine them changing it too much.

More power and better joy cons are all I need.


Well last month or so when we hear developers had dev kits we heard that the system would be portable again.


Nintendo absolutely needs to market this thing as a next gen sequel console and none of this "Wii U" confusion.


Yeah this was always going to be the case, they don't do pure handheld anymore so it's switch type consoles from here on out.


I'm assuming they would have demoed some sort of dev kit. Probably just a generic box with the console's hardware inside.


That'd be a mistake to change it now when they got such a successful gen. But then it's Nintendo so you never know.


Honestly what would be great would be a screen-less version for people who exclusively use it in the dock. 

No need to pay for something you don't use.


I'm really glad. There was some concern that they would try to do something wild despite the fact that they have a winning formula with Switch.


My last Nintendo console before the Switch was a SNES, and the Switch is such an amazing compromise of mobility and big-screen gaming\* that I want it to extend forever, until the sun winks out.

\*okay maybe not at 4K


If they’re smart they’re just tweak the design and give it more power


I think that's probably just what the writer is calling it.  There's nothing in the article to indicate what the form factor is


The Wii U deserves the credit. It was most of the way there in the design. If you only play your Switch at home, the Wii U was essentially the same thing.


It better be backwards compatible too. The Wii was huge, but that was also before online/digital gaming _really_ took off. People have built very sizable Switch libraries, both physical and digital. But if they get told “welp too bad, doesn’t transfer”, I think it’s going to be a really hard sell. 

I buy physical whenever I can, but especially on PC physical just no longer exists. But I know on PC that the platform will either be supported forever, or modders will release fixes to make games playable on modern operating systems. So I have less qualms about buying digital PC games. But where’s the guarantee that any console game I buy digitally today I’ll be able to play on the newest system years from now?


Switch U


Super Switch!


Calling it the Switch 2 would be the most straight-forward thing they could do. There's a reason Sony went with that naming scheme for the playstations. People understand that if there's a 2 after it then it's *the one after*. Anything else is a marketing contrivance that you have to explain to people. But "Switch 2"? Everyone gets it.


The old Nintendo Switcheroo


Two-itch


SWiitch 2U


 Switch + Ultra


The Nintendo Bitch


The Nintendo "Three Gens-Behind Bait&Switch"


Best we can do is Swiitch


damn you got a chuckle out of me.  If they call that shit a Switcharoo im getting 2 at launch because that shit is tooo funny


The Wii lost steam and the brand lost a ton of value. It was seen as a fad by the end of its life.  The huge casual market they captured had moved onto Mobile games.


Prime 4 is way too niche to be the big launch title for Nintendo’s next generation, they’ll probably want to launch it with a more evergreen/casual friendly game like Mario Kart.


Honestly, i think they should drop Prime 4 for Switch, and just make it a Switch 2 exclusive, the Switch is already pushing its limits with TOTK and XC3


I could imagine it being backwards compatible with the ability to upgrade resolution on older games. 

If Dolphin can bump up resolution and anti-aliasing on games there should be no reason Nintendo can't do it. 

It is Nintendo though so who the fuck knows.


Pikmin 4 suspiciously lacking real coop was a downer, maybe they’re saving it for the eventual deluxe edition like Pikmin 3 did?


Wasn’t Prime 1 a launch title for the GameCube? Or am I misremembering (didn’t own it myself)


A robust system for increasing performance of older Switch titles would be incredible. If not, I at least hope they go back and patch a number of their Switch games, especially the earlier ones.


I don't think the switch ever lost a sale to the steam deck. That console fell into its tiny niche immediately. So much for "switch killer."


Then you can re purchase your entire switch catalogue. So that the second gen switch can run the same games like they run on a emulator for the steamdeck.


Unfortunately I think they want to sell you on the OLED later.


The recent rumor I read is that they will go with LCD at launch to keep costs down. Doesn't the new Sony "portable" use LCD rather than OLED?


OLED in this size is still quite a bit more expensive, unless they're aiming at 5" screens


As someone who exclusively plays docked it doesn't bother me if it keeps the console price low.

But I understand why many would be annoyed and disappointed if the screen isn't up to par at launch with LCD instead of OLED.


Yeah if they launch with LCD I’ll just hold off for an OLED version.


No OLED, no buy for me. I can’t go back to LCD


It's my one major gripe with Steam Deck. I can pat for a super premium version, but it still isn't OLED?


They will make OLED version later as a "new console" when the sales slow down.


It'd be cool if they went miniLED/FALD, for that middle ground of good contrast without the worry of burn-in. But I'm not sure how that tech scales


It’s seriously amazing how bad Xbox has been with naming besides the bullseye they hit with the 360. 

I feel it could maybe confuse people who are young but I do wish they’ll do the Super Switch.


Are you playing on version 1.0 or something? It's a pretty smooth 30fps for me.


There was a leak a while back with the specs. Forget specifics, but I remember being pleasantly surprised.


They’re seemingly using Tegra T239 according to rumours, supposedly a custom-made SOC designed specifically for Nintendo.


There is Rumour of a full 3D donkey Kong similar to odyssey.


It might get it eventually but I doubt it would be close to launch, rockstar releases ports and remakes pretty slowly


I mean there’s no reason not to port RDR2 if it can run


Does RDR even run on anything remotely similar to RDR2's RAGE


This is so hyperbolic lol. The only time there was any sort of legitimate "Switch Pro incoming!!!" buzz was back in 2020, and shortly after that fizzled out, it became readily obvious that the global ship shortage caused Nintendo to pivot to just the OLED model.

This is the same Eurogamer journalist who successfully reported on both the NX concept and internals back in 2016, and the Switch will be 7 years old next year. This isn't some bullshit Twitter "leaker" stuff.


They'll continue to sell well as all existing switches will eventually develop drift


Another GameFreak-developed pokemon game would be in the single digits for framerate. If nothing else those sloppy fucks need more runway so TPC can print money on plushies and cards.


the switch is at the end of its life cycle (7 years), i was thinking the same at the start of this year, but waited on it. And this Super Switch looks like it will be backwards compatible, so you won't miss out on games from the Switch, i would wait a bit longer.


We've had two in the mainline Series this generation that look great


Totk and Botw are gorgeous...


If he did then honestly I don blame him


“It’s Joe’s time to shine! Ka-blamo!”


Can you play as Dark Brandon from the start or is that New Game+?


Yeah, we can always manufacture more presidents while the Switch 2 disappearing would make Nintendo consider the nuclear option against any approximate location they suspect the thieves went to.


I'm thinking that the DLSS is helping A LOT and that it gets the visuals close (from a quick eyeball perspective) to a Series S


People really need to set proper expectations with the word "Comparable" here.

This is most likely said by someone who just watched it at a glance and not doing some comprehensive side-by-side comparison.

Expecting the Switch 2 to run on par with current gen is just setting oneself for dissapointment.

From the Nvidia leaks the Switch 2's specs is closer to the PS4 Pro, and we don't even know what clockspeed it's gonna be in (Nintendo prefers to underclock to save battery life)


Maybe instead of running at 1440p-4k it'll continue to run at 1080p but with the same bells and whistles?


Yeah. If the user base is anything close to Switch the ports will be insane in numbers. Already feels like everyone and their grandma is porting to the current switch anything that will run.


It’s skipping like 2-3 generations in terms of power from the Switch, that would be incredible


Well current gen consoles are a couple years old. So Nintendo should be able to catch them for the second half of their cycle.


No wonder Sony is making a PS5 pro. Performance is PS5's only advantage. Without it, there's zero reason to get a PS5 over the Switch. The Switch 2 may just kill PlayStation in Japan once and for all. Performance is the single biggest reason why some developers like Bandai Namco and Falcom still skip Switch on their new games.


IMO the switch 2 NEEDS to be fully backwards compatible with the Switch 1. That will be such a massive sale booster for them, I for one would literally pre-order the thing day one if that was announced. Having your library fully compatible would be so good. For BotW, I could see them marking out certain games(namely BotW and TotK, among other first party games) and giving them focus for next-gen upgrades. Not anything major, just a focus for 60fps, maybe upscaled textures and better lighting or something.


God I wish


Hm games running in switch 1 docked mode when switch 2 is undocked ?


Nintendo has shown time and time again that it is way too greedy for that. We'll get backwards compatibility but no way will we get game upgrades for free.


That would take me from "no thanks, I'd rather wait for a Steam Deck 2" to seriously considering buying it, lol


>Dlss too overpowered.

No kidding. Half the reason the Switch 2 sounds cool to me is because I've seen what DLSS can do on PC and how it's improved over time. You can get some seriously great image quality even on *performance* mode, so 1080p -> 4K. In other words, it would enable the Switch 2 to be Nintendo's first 4K console

I find the idea of building an "underpowered" console with this tech in mind as part of the base feature set incredibly fascinating. And if anyone here has used a Steam Deck, you've probably seen at some point that FSR2 balanced mode actually looks pretty okay despite the resolutions we're talking about

Given how the gap between DLSS and FSR2 widen significantly as resolution goes down, I think it would be incredibly viable in portable play. No more 540p games looking like an absolute mess, DLSS does some black magic to make that input look worlds apart from the final image


Not likely. But Nintendo is the only console that is Nvidia based which gives them access to tech like DLSS.


I wouldn't expect that. This will still be a handheld at an affordable price.


> You're trying to tell me that this is actually aiming to be at PS5/Xbox series X level?

Run a demo at comparable level to Xbox Series X/PS5 =/= having the same specs. 

DLSS is most likely doing most of the heavy lifting in making it LOOK comparable to those. It most likely on par with PS4 Pro other wise, which is pretty good for a handheld.


I'm very confused why people aren't mentioning it, but the switch 2 doesn't need to produce 4K graphics while in hand held mode.  If they can produce something similar to the steam deck in handheld and somehow make docking up the graphics output to 4K then they're golden.


That would roughly align with how the Switch compared to the competition when it released. By the time the OG Switch released it was about a generation behind, in terms of raw power. It sounds like their prototype is on par with current-gen consoles, which would put them a few years behind by the time it releases. Not that crazy to consider.


And people will still complain it looks last gen.


If it's backwards compatible then they usually don't. For instance, Switch got a ton of Wii U ports, but there was no way to play them on Switch otherwise and Wii U had abysmal sales. Wii got a few GC ports but Nintendo was trying to market motion controls. Wii U got a some Wii games digitally but it was basically Virtual Console. DS didn't get GBA ports, 3DS didn't get DS ports.    
    
Now, I can see them releasing a Switch 2 version of TotK because they are YEARS away from another system seller Zelda game.


> people in the know should be able to pinpoint the exact chip that's gonna use

The best guess right now is T239.


We already know with *pretty* high certainty it's the Tegra T239 (Ampere graphics, which is a DX12 Ultimate design - good baseline, similar feature set as the other consoles), but the problem is we don't know what node it's being manufactured on and how many CPU and GPU cores Nintendo will choose to disable and what frequency they will run them at, plus what the memory bandwidth will be, etc. All of these factors together can make the resulting chip vary from slightly-above-Xbox-One to slightly-below-PS4 Pro in performance.


Nintendo is literally the most respected developer in the industry. Their strategy is the reason why they can make games ranging from a to aaa and still make money. You can't say that for the other 2


It was hilarious to watch everyone freaking out at the NX leaks. Everyone called the leaked specs fake because there was "no way" Nintendo would make a console so weak. Meanwhile, devs had known about it for years.

In general, disappointing leaks are the most likely to be true. People who make things up tend to make up leaks that are too good to be true.


My favourite was people saying "wow we'll finally get a full console scale Pokemon game, it'll be so cool!"

If only they knew...


It's understandable that people were pretty skeptical, given that Nintendo was really not doing great at that time.


The one that made me LOL was a guy saying this meant we were getting a home console Pokemon excitedly... little did they know the most polished Pokemon games already existed.


Smell-o-vision


I think it's a little concerning for as well as the Switch did. There's usually a new gimmick with the consoles and this might shoehorn them into being a Switch-like factory. Also combining their consoles means if one fails they have to dedicate their entire company to 6-8 years of it and nothing to fall back on like the 3DS after the Wii U failed.


I've always thought they'd release a "UnSwitch" the opposite of the switch lite where the console is the dock and it doesn't have any joycons. I know there's a lot of people out there that never use the switch and portable mode. Would make sense the time to do it with a hardware enhanced version.


Don’t you mean most iterative? And least innovative from a hardware standpoint after (Wii, Wii U, and Switch).


There are also rumors that Nintendo is working with Google on a VR headset. Take it with a grain of salt, but I'd certainly like to see what Nintendo would do in VR.


Id love to see them just stick with this console, and iterate over as time goes on. But this is Nintendo, so you know they are going to do something dumb sometime soon


I’ve had the idea of like a “SwitchU” where the console isn’t portable but the switch acts as a controller to the console (or you can use regular controllers, depends on the game) that way fun WiiU games like the Luigi Ghost game from NintendoLand can exist again :’) miss that game


Switch U


Super Switch is the only choice.

> Wii U was Wii II

Wii Motion Plus was Wii 2. Switch is Wii U 2, version 2 of their console is also a handheld concept.


This is Nintendo we're talking about.  Who knows what the hell they're going to do, for better or worse


This may cause an issue, unless they go in a complete different marketing direction, we could end up with another Wii U scenario


I think the best strategy is to have an incremental console that allows for cross gen ports. Once a few years have passed and the new console is the standard, just make new gen exclusives. It's the most boring strategy though, but it would make sense since they've struck gold this gen.


The switch lite is pure handheld no?


Yep, I imagine this would drop the price quite significantly for the tens of millions of people who only use the Switch as a console:

* No need to put hardware in both the dock and console, it's just one unit
* No need for the integrated screen, touchscreen sensors etc
* No need for detachable joy-cons or magnetic strip on the sides of the unit
* No need to include built in speakers - it can rely entirely on HDMI pass through for audio
* No need for a battery

That said, it's Nintendo and they only really care about the Japanese Market, where its almost exclusively a handheld so its unlikely to happen - if anything the dock would be sold separately a la the Steam Deck.

Edit: I'm not sure why your post is controversial, options are good - few people complained about the handheld only version of the Switch!


I like Switcheroo better.


That would be great actually!


Best I can do is "Switch One".


Has Nintendo ever done a straight forward name for a sequel console? 

NES - SNES,  GB - GBA, DS - 3DS, Wii - Wii U

I fully expect Nintendo to call this the New Nintendo Switch Plus or something obnoxious


> Calling it the Switch 2 would be the most straight-forward thing they could do.

And that's why I'm confident it won't be called that.


The problem with Nintendo calling the "Switch 2" would have the same problem Xbox did when they came out with the 360 (though to a lesser extent because Sony isn't so much of a direct competitor as it was). Xbox knew they couldn't call the 360 "Xbox 2" because it would be going up against the "Playstation 3" and gives the impression that they're behind.


Yeah, but this is Nintendo we're talking about here. Straightforward numbering is not really their thing.


Exactly the Wii U naming scheme is the reason it failed it literally sounds like an add on instead of a proper next-gen console


Switch

Swiitch

Swiiitch

Swivtch


Mario Kart 8 Super Duper Deluxe


Prime 4 would be a good start, but I'd expect Mario Kart 9.


Probably also going to have the next mainline Mario game ready for it.


I see Prime 4 as a great launch window game, maybe a month or two out from launch. The hard-core are buying the system first and it would appeal to them, but it would also be the best boon for Metroid possible by getting new users to try it out during the new console hype period.


Mario 128 when?


Nintendo likely wants Prime 4 to be ready for Launch because it's a big WESTERN title release.

They'll probably have something for the casuals (like 1 2 Switch), but if the game is ready enough they'll probably release Prime 4 with the system to gauge interest in the Western Gaming Market.


Prime 4, Smash Ultimate Deluxe, Mario Odyssey sequel as launch or launch window covers a lot of ground. 


Though.... launch titles might be less important if it's backwards compatible, then it stands to reason to focus on a game that shows a huge upgrade like Prime 4.


It was already pushing its limits with Breath of the Wild and Xenoblade 2.


>Honestly, i think they should drop Prime 4 for Switch, and just make it a Switch 2 exclusive,

* Metroid already sells 'poorly', putting it on a brand new console only would be suicide for the brand. Metroid Dread is the highest selling Metroid game and has only sold 3M.
* It's target console is the Switch and is probably far in development, I doubt dropping it now would help the Switch 2 version significantly at this rate.


Since they have already announced it for Switch, i think Cross Gen is the most we'll get with that.

Straight up dropping it for Switch 1 would probably piss off more fans than it'd do good for thegame


I guess it depends if the dev team has been really struggling or not on the hardware. Keeping it available for both systems would mean substantial sales from Switch 1 owners who don’t care about graphics too much, while also being able to show off the game in full glory on S2. 

Plus, if they finally have a good software compatibility/upgrade process in place, it would give Switch 1 buyers of the game even more reason to upgrade sooner.


Pretty sure it wasn't designed to be a co-op game, nothing suspicious about it. 

The idea of splitting tasks between captains is severely downplayed compared to i.e. Pikmin 3 and the new over-the-shoulder view makes it more akin to a single player action-adventure.


It was not


Yea probably will. Not exactly a issue I like it when good developers have actual tools to work with.


What it actually means is that they won’t sell me one at launch at all, and I’ll wait for the OLED.


Yep, it's always going to be this way. The "we're trying to save production costs" is totally bunk, as they've proven to have production chains for OLED already. They know they can make us double-dip by holding off. And Nintendo isn't the only offender here which reinforces my point.


yeah but its just a remote play device which acts as an accessory. it doesnt do native playback.


An OLED wouldn't raise the price basically at all. It's not about that.


steam deck you kind lf get it as the 16:10 aspect ratio is rather unusual and there's not that much of a need for those OLED-panels.


Tbh even the 360 is a dumb name


People want to be bitter that leakers "lied" to them. They don't want to admit business plans can and will change especially during a global pandemic. Let them live their sad lives.


/r/tomorrow users are long suffering… hopefully we’ll finally be outta this tomorrow, though!


It's going to be a nightmare for collectors over the years if they plan on playing the Switch handheld due to Joycon drift.

Hopefully the Switch 2 will be fully backwards compatible.


The art direction also lends itself to having an incredibly long shelf life, too. These games can be re-released in 10 years-time with minor QoL improvements, and they'll still look great. Wind Waker HD is a good example of this.


what would a Zelda that runs at 720/1080/60fps be then? ultra super great, most gorgeous game of all time?


I mean, US presidents are every 4 years, Switch 2 has been waited for 7 so....


Series S is really all they need to target to keep competitive. Microsoft accidentally lowered the bar for them by releasing a weaker model and requiring devs to support both. And even though one game has already dropped parity between X and S, I imagine the potential of Switch-level game sales could be more motivating to some devs.


Even rendering at half the resolution of a series S would look pretty nice on a handheld. Very nice if nintendo is leveraging DLSS as much as possible.


DLSS plus likely having a 1080p screen or less. Not to mention Nvidia is just better with RTX. If this thing has DLSS 3 support it’ll be a beast


This is a win for a Nintendo console regardless, I’ll happily take Series S performance.


Some reports are saying it's comparable to PS5/Series X.


passing the eye test isn't nothing to my mind. Seems like it might signal that a future of console graphical/technical prowess having diminishing returns as far as customers are concerned might be sooner than we think.


My bet is a 1080p image with DLSS to bring it up to near-4k.

Still puts it firmly in third place behind the Series S’ original claims of being the 1440p machine (regardless of the actual numbers, IIRC that was the marketing claim) but DLSS should do a better job of cleaning that up than FSR does.


it wont


Not really?

When the switch launched it was inbetween the PS3 and PS4 in terms of power.

This rumor would place it in-between the PS4 and PS5 in terms of power.

Sounds like it's just moving forward 1 gen to me


It’s a handheld, that’s what makes it so surprising to hear.


That would make it outperform the steam deck. Nintendo haven't focussed on high-end specs since the Gamecube and instead focussed on innovation. If true, the Switch 2 would be a mix of both and is super exciting.


Wasn’t Nintendo Switch a significant power downgrade to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, despite releasing 4 years later?


Falcon might not be a good example, has their next game is launching on PS4/PS5 and switch. 

They're too small of a studio to bother with porting their games to other platform.


> No wonder Sony is making a PS5 pro.

That's a rumor.


God imagine how tight Elden Ring on the Switch 2 would be. I'd buy the game again for that frankly.


lolwut? excluding all the ps5 exclusives that you cant play on switch, there are plenty of reasons to get the ps5 over the switch.

trophies, a way better online multiplayer system, better voice and message chat, better controller, the VR headset support, a more organized storefront with less shovelware, better discounts on first party titles, better third party support, a better subscription catalog, better remote play capabilities, 4k bluray media playback, more TV and streaming apps, and the list goes on and on.

even the switch 2 wont be as powerful as a ps5 or series X. if sony releases the ps5 pro then it will be to compete with microsoft, not nintendo. nintendo hasnt competed with either of them on a hardware level since the gamecube.


I would preorder it and actually build a legitimate Switch backlog. Emulation is great, but it isn't flawless, but those flaws are usually outweighed by the increased image quality and performance over real hardware. If they can bring games on Switch to locked 60fps with increased resolution on Switch 2, that's a huge selling point over emulation on even the Steam Deck right now.


I think the game industry has accepted it's mandatory from this point on. Games take so long to make now that a console without BC is a console that won't have anything to play on it until the next console is about out. Thus Microsoft releasing so many free boosts for old games on Series X, even 3rd party games that have since most likely lost the source code.


Not upgrades, better performance.


The whole thing about DLSS (and frame gen) is fascinating. That a lot of the time it's easier and sometimes *better* to render less frames at a lower resolution and then using the free headroom on *the same hardware* to paint between the pixels and make it full res anyway.


A lot of the doubt about DLSS is from people who haven’t seen it and don’t understand what it can do. Also what the recent demos of DLSS 3.5 at Gamescom have shown for ray-traced lighting and minimising the performance hit via AI.


It also shouldn’t be underestimated that Nintendo has had the opportunity to work with them from start to finish on producing hardware that meets exactly what they want their console to deliver. Both Sony and Microsoft work with AMD, so if Nintendo asks for something from Nvidia, I imagine they get it, and at a very reasonable price, for fear of losing the entire console market to AMD.


4k is 9 times more pixels than 720p


Nintendo needs to pull a strongman move and fucking forget about 4k. We're not ready, nobody's ready, nobody perfers 4k over high framerates and most if not all people can't really tell the difference. Stupid 4k is the reason games are 100gbs. Thousands of dollars rigs barely make it to 4k. 

Nintendo should stay in its lane and shine where it shine and that's currently low power miracle.


Switch felt like it was like PS3.5 level to be honest.  This would be jumping a couple generations


Because it does


Hell if anything they outdid used prices for Wii games on Wii u. 20 dollars for Xenoblade Chronicles and Metroid prime trilogy really brought down the price of used copies


Except this leak isn’t really disappointing and, judging by the leakers track record, is probably true


I mean, ScarVi are full scaled and have a lot of good stuff in them. 

They are just held together by duct tape and a dream.


True, BOTW and the Switch pretty much saved Nintendo.


Wario game released, thousands dead


A leak I saw was with a camera on it. Like the DSi or the Wii U.


This is the fallback. The Switch represents them ceding the console market to entirely focus on handhelds because they've never faced serious competition there.

Edit: The Switch is a home console in the same way a laptop can also act as a desktop replacement. It's clearly designed with handheld use being the primary pitch performance wise and dockability being a bonus.


>I think it's a little concerning for as well as the Switch did. There's usually a new gimmick with the consoles and this might shoehorn them into being a Switch-like factory.

Is that really a bad thing?

 I'm old enough to remember when the most gimmicky thing about the new Nintendo console was the size of the discs, and it was just fine. 

 I'm sure they'll try to add *something* to this next console, but I think the Switch form-factor is a match made in heaven and honestly I'd argue it's very much along the lines of the gimmick they attempted with the Wii U anyway....just far more competently done. 

   IMO they'd be fools to seriously change it just for the sake of novelty, at least for this generation.


Yeah, but the Switch was born from the 3DS AND the Wii U. From that 'failure', they arose Phoenix-like.


A lot of us were happy with just going from Nes>Super Nes>N64>Gamecube and then we started getting experimental. The Wii worked, the Wii U was a failure, the Switch works...and if they tried to reinvent who knows what we would lose just to potentially get another Wii U.

Id rather they just perfect the Switch. Everyones copying them so they obviously hit a homerun.


>I know there's a lot of people out there that never use the switch and portable mode.

According to Nintendo's own data about 40% play mostly handheld and 50% are balanced, so it's only 10% of the Switch userbase that use it completely docked.


It doesn’t make sense for Nintendo because it would devalue the standard Switch and it would also create a 3rd profile to consider for developers.


I had always assumed that's what the rumoured switch pro was.  Switch lite for purely handheld play, a note powerful pro for purely TV play


They have new leadership and have made a lot of changes to their internal decision making processes and also how they communicate with their consumers. Their decision making has been pretty sound from a business perspective since the Switch released.  Perhaps they've learned from their past mistakes.  

But I certainly understand where you're coming from though.  I've been following this company for 30 years and the amount of times they've made completely asinine decisions is too many to count.


So basically a wiiu


Super sWiitch U 64 Entertainment System.


Don't forget "New Nintendo Switch".


Super *Nintendo Switch


I unironically love Super Switch.


I was fully in favor of that name until somebody reminded me that it would be called the Nintendo SS.


"Super" is a terrible name for a completely new console when we live in a world with "Pro" variants. It should just be Switch 2. Avoid any confusion


Wii Motion Plus considered (in this scenario) as Wii 2? Wild.


They better fix the drifting issues on their joy cons... it's almost as bad as the red ring of death issues from the Xbox era.


Thing about the Wii U is that the gimmick of the Wii had lost it's novelty near the end of it's lifespan. Hardware and software sales were both declining. The Wii U was also a bad console with not many good launch titles and a bad gimmick.

Switch is still highly successful because it's good and people like it. Give them something better? It will be a success.


I really, really hope they learned from that


That would be a classic Nintendo move though


Nintendo will likely have a much more limited cross gen approach compared to PS and Xbox. Titles like Metroid that aren’t massive system sellers will likely be cross gen as they’ll benefit from the larger userbase, but flagship releases like Mario kart or Smash will definitely be next gen exclusive even if they launch early on.


yes, sort of. it depends on how you classify it. while it is technically a handheld, its ultimately just a variation of the already existing switch, and they both play 99 percent of the same library. 

this isnt the same comparison as the wii compared to the DS, where one was objectively a home console with its own exclusive library of games while the other was specifically a handheld with its own library. with the switch the line gets blurred between the normal model and the lite model because they're both essentially the same thing. 

its like how a tomato is considered a fruit but a lot of people call it a vegetable because of how its utilized.


Well, the detachable joycons have motion controls and so some games can only be played through detaching them, such as Ring Fit Adventure (one of the best selling games on the switch).


Switch Series S and X. Please refer to this marketing material on which is "the good one" and why they don't look alike.


I swear MS is memeing with their console names.


Super Advanced 3Switch U it is


>Has Nintendo ever done a straight forward name for a sequel console? 

You act like that prohibits them from changing that up lol


Yes. Until the Wii U.   
Nintendo. Better one? Super. Plays 64 bit games? Nintendo 64.   
Gameboy. Add color? Gameboy Color. Better one? Advanced  
DS - 3DS (plays 3D games). 3D bad for kids? no problem 2DS  
Wii. Better one? U...huh?   

They did a decent job of describing what the console was until the Wii U. 

The switch is a bit more abstract in that you can switch from a docked home console to a portable, but the Wii U, was just too abstract. It apparently was named that because the Wii was meant to be a party console but the Wii U was meant to be a solo console or something, but to me that was just too far of a reach. 

Super Nintendo Switch is one a lot of people throw out, but I'm not sure how well that'll work. Nintendo has completely dropped the 'entertainment system' part of the naming, as 'nintendo' simply became the casual name of the console for most people. Nintendo Switch instead got shortened to Switch. So Nintendo Super Switch could be better, but they've never really repeated the term they use for 'better one'. Also Super Nintendo Switch abbreviates to SNS which is a common acronym already. I think they'd want to avoid pro as that's a term already used by the other companies. A couple of other words they could use: Elite, Prime


I hadn't considered that - it's not a bad point


There's enough of a gap between 2 and 5 that I don't think anyone will think a Switch 2 is old and a PS5 is newer. Plus nobody thinks this is only the 2nd console Nintendo ever made


If only they could just skip numbers like they do with Windows


shoulda just called it xbox 3 then and say 2 was lost in an alternate reality


NEW Mario Kart 8 Deluxe


[deleted]


All DLC included!


They'll just tilt the 8 and make Mario Kart ∞, because it will last forever at this rate.


Super Mario Kart 9 will be 12 new tracks with all the DLC from 8's DLC drip fed over the next 2 and a half years.


Also, if the graphical leap is as impressive as it sounds, a first party FPS with a strong art design wouldn't be the worst way to show that off.


Xenoblade 2 on my 4K was one of the roughtest things I've ever seen in a game.


BOTW? Not really, that game was built for the Wii U, XC2 i can see how it would.


prime 1 sold 2.8 for a near-ish launch title, and is one of the best selling gamecube games


Metroid Prime Remastered is not only one of the highest reviewed games of 2023, but it sold a million copies in one month.

You're wild to think Prime 4 wouldn't sell just as well as that or Dread. Especially if it's a Launch title to a new system. This is like saying Twilight Princess is gonna bomb because Wind Waker sold like shit on the Nintendo Wii.


Your crazy if you think it's not coming out for the new console, it might do a BOTW and release on both but it's been in development Hell for years and it's absolutely going to be on the new console


The thing is, the average Metroid fan is likely a major Nintendo fan, so the system would be a day one purchase for them, i doubt that it could really hurt the game.


i bought a switch for mp4 and id rather they move it to the switch 2.  with how long ive waited whats another year?


Exact reason why I’m not buying persona 3 remake right now and any future persona games that come out


I'm sure it would up costs by a bit, but I figured if they were already doing premium options...


True, but it worked.


Yea it was so dumb of a name, you turned 360 degrees and walked away from it


Its pretty trivial to swap out the sticks to hall-effect sticks.


It would also look good. Doesn't mean that the existing games don't.


there is 1 3d zelda that runs at 60fps across all systems, and it is a half emulated port of a wii game


Of course, Nintendo missing the release window for their next console would have far more devastating consequences than missing an election for the US.


[deleted]


BG3 is going to have it on both - just XSX first then eventually XSS when they've done further optimizations.


no fucking way. not calling you a liar ofc but thats just so hard to believe.


That would be absolutely awesome. People always say Nintendo doesn't need power to make the games they make. And that's technically correct. But they will benefit from power and we all know it will sell regardless of price.


That seems ridiculous. No way they can get close to that performance while being portable.


I'll believe it when I see it.


Shit if that's true and I can still play my old Switch games on it, that's a day one buy for sure then.


god, imagine a Xenoblade game with with the fidelity of a current gen console. Those open worlds really deserve it.


That actually makes sense as these consoles are now three years old. Nintendo with that kind of visual prowess and optimization will be incredible.


Considering the switch was already 2 behind to begin with, it's possible


It would be funny if the Switch 2 was just a steam deck running a Switch emulator


I mean, the Steam Deck plays current gen games so it's not that surprising. I've said before that all Nintendo needs to do is have the Switch 2 be on par with the Steam Deck with a better battery life and they'll be golden.


I’ve heard it described as a “ps3 and a half” worth of power


Only Ys. The president said in interview that Kuro is exclusive to PS4/5 because they target higher graphical fidelity.


That and Sekiro and all the Souls games.


Nintendo is one of the most greedy companies that exist and doesn't care what the consumer wants. I would be shocked if you can run your old games on it. 

Its much more likely they sell you all the same games at a slightly higher price, they are probably spending 50% of the development time ensuring they lock down the console better than the switch1


If you told me back in the days that AI generating stuff in realtime would be faster than using actual stuff I would have never believed you but ... here we are!


Frame gen isn’t magic. You already need a high level of performance or you get bad input lag. For Frame Gen you need to be getting already 60-70fps already.

Frame Gen is not gonna be very useable on consoles imo.


It doesn't need to run  *natively* 4k. 

It can run natively at 1080p or even 720p and have its video resolution DLSS'd up to 4k. Again, not real "4k" . The image quality will just look good enough that most people won't really notice or care that it's not actually real 4k.

https://youtu.be/_gQ202CFKzA?si=Mj7iATPA4dbkhau0


I mean, Switch 2 being a PS4.5 isn't jumping a couple of generations, it's just one.


But also they had to release the switch earlier than planned probably, since the Wii u was a bomb. Or whatever prototype they had before.


Saved Nintendo? I mean yeah, the Wii U was a giant flop but with the amount of Wii's they've sold I really struggle to imagine them being on the ropes after just 1 bad console cycle


The power of garlic is just too strong.


The Switch is also a home console though, and probably also competes in that space.

There are many times when I’m debating if I should buy the PS5 or Switch version of a new game.


But.. the switch is also a home console


The switch not only works as a home console, it's the best one for 2+ party play


Those disc sizes weren’t just a gimmick, they were supposed to be harder to copy. And unfortunately, their *capacity* was also smaller, which is why a lot of major games like GTA never saw a GameCube release. It may have been a cutesy gimmick for the end user, but those small discs sealed the fate of the GameCube more than any other decision Nintendo made in that generation.


Either way: the flagship model should always be the most powerful one, so even an undocked model would run the same specs.

And having the flagship model be a home only console destroys the entire concept.


I’ve had mine since launch day. The dock is still in the box.


50% of people okay their switch with the stand out? Is that what balanced means? That’s wild if so,


No more than the switch lite did


Sony had the PSTV, Nintendo could do similar.


Yeah! But with many wiiu tablets connected, local multiplayer games could be sick!


GameCube erasure


Excuse me, I think you mean Super Nintendo Switch Entertainment System.


I feel like it's such a no-brainer for Nintendo. Alliteration, a nostalgic nod to Super Nintendo, and a fun name to choose for a company that wants to be associated with family-friendly fun.


Ehhhh, I get what you're saying but I feel like Nintendo's 'Super' moniker still holds enough cache for consumers to understand that it's a new console in a way that the 'U' suffix infamously didn't.


They don't want to seem like they're copying Sony.


Nah, the Wii U was pretty good but it didnt have enough games in time. There's a reason why most first party games for the Switch are 8 year old Wii U ports.


Back when they marketed the Wii U they forgot to say it's a new console, not an add-on. People just thought it was an accessory.


[deleted]


That's not what they've done with Zelda over the two previous console launches though.


Neat, sell them as an accessory for people to get them if they want to play games that require it.


Dont forget about the Switch One X.


I'm not saying it can't happen, just keeping my expectations in a certain place

Hell, Sony is basically the only console company that's done numbered iterations as far as I can remember


A&W tried selling a 1/3 pounder burger for the same price as McDonald's 1/4 pounder.  A&W lost that battle, because most people thought McDonald's burger was bigger.

Never underestimate how stupid people are.


That would actually be kinda sick


My 250h in Xenoblade 2 made the investment in the mCable worth it. Anything helps with that game.


BOTW was locked at 30fps at a resolution of 900p upscaled to 1080p and *still* had frame drops on the Switch while docked. It was definitely pushing its limits. Playing the game at 4K/60fps on PC (CEMU emulation) is such a treat in comparison.


> BOTW

In some areas the frames drop a lot. The game was clearly pushing the limit of the Switch. And I only played it docked.


The switch is not more powerful than the Wii-U really. It is strong enough to run Wii-U games but not much past it. Botw struggled to run in quite a few areas.

Also Xenoblade 2 ram at like 240p in a lot of areas. It's a great looking game but it does not run well.


The wii u is about as fast as a switch if not faster.


>and is one of the best selling gamecube games

Not a particularly high bar


>Your crazy if you think it's not coming out for the new console,

Read my comment again, carefully this time


Metroid fans aren't a big demographic. The best selling Metroid gane sold like 3 million copies, saying it's not a system seller it's an understatement.


Of the franchises that Nintendo could use as a launch title system seller, Metroid probably isn't a terrible choice but definitely isn't at the top of the list either. 3D Mario and Zelda are the big ones, and I think at this point Splatoon or even an ambitious new MonolithSoft title could probably push a system out the door more than Metroid could.

But speculation is often kind of moot with Nintendo's left-field thinking.


don't assume please


Ah the old " I bought a ps3 for kingdom hearts 3" curse.


I’m legitimately confused how that has anything to do with what I said.


So towards it?


I didn't know that there's Hall Effect Sticks for Joycons. Gotta look into it, thanks.


It's very easy to bork your joycons changing out the sticks yourself.

Hall sticks also cost quite a bit.


Unironically, yes.


I suspect he meant performance competitive not market competitive but, yes, the performance of the Switch and its successor is almost irrelevant. Nintendo games are going to sell regardless.


The series s lowers the bar for the hardware Nintendo needs to develop in order to achieve adequate parity with current gen platforms, thus making it easier for developers to port existing and future titles to switch 2, which has been the only major pain point for switch I can personally identify.

Aka they are gonna dominate even harder with switch 2.


While I do think Nintendo definitely needs to get with the times in terms of tech I agree with you, people buy Nintendo consoles because of Nintendo games not how powerful the console is.

Apparently they ran the Matrix demo that was used to show off the capabilities of Series X/PS5. 

They used DLSS and said visually is comparable to Series X/PS5.

EDIT: https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-nintendo-showed-switch-2-demos-at-gamescom/

You people are crazy


It doesn't have to be.

Of course it won't get anywhere close in terms of raw computing power, but using shortcuts like designated cores just for Ray-Tracing as well as the fact that the device is simply just much newer makes it believable to me that, in terms of visuals, it'll be close enough to make comparisons fair.

This video demonstrates what I mean:

Yeah I've seen what some texture pack mods and playing the game in 4k can do to Breath of the Wild graphically and it looks absolutely gorgeous. 

I would love to see what magic Nintendos developers could do with something as good as PS5/Series X


If they can make a machine that’s decently powerful especially vs the steam deck it’s also going to reduce emulation by a good margin too.

My intuition tells me one of the main drivers for emulating their games is to get them running on more powerful hardware.


While true, they've put out powerful consoles before. I think the GameCube was more powerful than the PS2 (not sure about the Xbox), but it lacked the almighty DVD player and came in third that generation.


They'll sell like hotcakes without power because there is no other option. No one wants to miss out on Mario or Zelda

But it is frustrating seeing TOTK run as badly as it does. They got what they could out of that hardware but still, playing games under 1080p and still dropping to like 20 FPS is rough


I'll have a handheld more powerful than my gaming PC if it can reach Series X level of performance.


Yeah a lot of people don't understand higher technical graphics helps stylized graphics immeasurably. It makes textures pop out and offers more visual variety when it can run the games at high resolution and offer longer draw distances, more actors on the field, etc... Zelda looks a million times better on PC modded than on the Switch. I feel these games will age extremely well on a new platform especially.


Thing about that is, some third party games have not launched on or run poorly on the Switch, even basic bitch Unity games.

Nintendo are missing out on a huge piece of the pie by not having better hardware to support a wider selection of games.

Considering how large the Switch install base is, I'm surprised they haven't upped their hardware game sooner.


It probably won't be that resolution but you could probably get the same graphics settings at 720p with portable. Doesn't need to be much more than that for a handheld. Potentially could do 720p and use DLSS to bump it to 1080p in handheld. 

Then docked do 1440p and use DLSS to bump it to 4k.


Agreed, and it's pretty telling they just say 'comparable' instead of simply giving some actual numbers. Most things can be considered 'comparable' if you stretch the meaning enough.


Dear Jesus Christ imagine Xenoblade

It's a handheld, not a plugged in console.  There are limitations that can't be summed up by calling it "2 generations behind".


Serious doubt.


Steamdeck runs outdated 2020 tech. Thing will be so underpowered compared to a Nvidia based console with DLSS releasing in late 2024.


Steam deck is comparable in power/performance to last gen consoles, not current.


The Switch has GOT to be your first Nintendo console because what the hell is this take...    
    
Here, [educate yourself](https://i.imgur.com/Yn1NQrP.jpg).


Yeah, they weren't even close. There was an article some years back about how Nintendo can run at a deficit of $250 million p/yr and still survive until 2052.


It wasn’t just a bad console cycle, iirc one of the years during the Wii U age was Nintendo’s worst year ever financially



It wasn't just one bad console.  Every console from the SNES to the Wii U sold less than its predecessor besides the Wii, which was viewed as a fad at the end of its life cycle and the Wii brand was not enough to carry a successor. The casual market had moved on.  The Wii ultimately was an outlier in the downward trend in their home console business.  Nintendo has an enormous war chest, but executives have even admitted that the Switch was a do or die moment for the company.  If it floundered it would've been extremely difficult for them to ever recover their reputation in the hardware business among developers, shareholders, and consumers.  Perhaps they would've made handhelds still, although phones and tablets fill the niche for so many people nowadays.  It's likely they would've become a dedicated software company like Sega decided to do after the Dreamcast underperformed directly after the Saturn failed.  

The Switch, and more importantly it's year 1 lineup of great games, saved Nintendo from that fate.


I don't own a PS5 yet. I have a launch PS4, and I still debate which console to get games on. If the Switch 2 can run games that would work on the Series X/S and PS5, it would be even more common.


They *were* harder to copy, piracy was practically non-existent on the Gamecube. Meanwhile the PS2 was so open everyone's dad knew a Turkish guy who could get you a full binder of games for cheap.

Remember that Nintendo was more profitable than Playstation during those years.


No balanced mean they use both modes regularly.


The Switch lite doesn't devalue the OG Switch and it doesn't create any extra work for developers.


ah yes because the PSTV went famously well for sony


The PSTV was a massive failure. Its a cool device, but when aiming for success and sales its not really something to be put on a pedestal.


So… the switch itself isn’t an actual console, just a screen controller. A straight sequel to Nintendo’s least successful console. And you expect households to spend hundreds of dollars on extra tablets that can only be used at home…

Ngl that actually sounds awful. And you can already bring your switch to someone’s house and play them from your own screen, so it’s pretty much worse in every way.


Fuck I forgot. Entertainment Cube then.


That's too logical for Nintendo. It will be Switch U.


Internet bubble thinking. The amount of young and casual people in the switch demographic who wouldn't know the NES/SNES connection is vast. Would be foolish to muddle the waters for a pointless reference.


I think you're underestimating how many gamers now are too young to remember the SNES.


If only we could get those Wind Waker and Twilight Princess ports


Nothing about the Wii U hardware was pretty good. It looked like cheap toy, it was underpowered, the gimmick was rarely, if ever, used well, and it was pretty expensive. The only positive was that it played Nintendo games.


This only works if the new switch is a reasonable price, the 3DS was initially a huge failure due to price.  Also there was not a wii version of BOTW



>Having a Wii and Wii U version of BOTW backfired.

What do you mean it backfired? It's the best selling Zelda by a long way, if anything it did the opposite of backfire.

Also, there wasn't a Wii version of BOTW


Both of the times they did a cross gen Zelda, the previous generations were unsuccessful, and the games themselves were primarily developed and initially promoted as games for the previous gen.


May I interest you in a game called Modnation Racers


GameCube didn't do that bad. Compared to previous and later Nintendo consoles it definitely sold on the weaker end but they sold about as many GameCube as Xbox has series S/X


prime 1 was one of the best selling gamecube games though, despite the general lack of sales for the series. depending on the game and marketing it could still work, nintendo hasn't had a """hardcore""" 1st party title for a while, the closest is xenoblade x or astral chain depending on how you want to argue this


My best guess is they meant they won’t be buying the games at launch, because Atlus has made improved versions of the games not too long after since P3.


Every persona game comes out for full price then a couple of years later they come out with an enhanced version that could have been dlc for full price again.


yep, Guilikit.

I can foresee this next switch is going to be a blockbuster seller.  Add to the fact, if some rumors are true and that its backwards compatible with the first Switch, so many Nintendo gamers and new fans are going to roll over to the next system.


Obviously Nintendo games are going to sell.  The point is if Switch 2 is comparable to Series S performance wise, AAA developers can much more easily make a Switch 2 version which will then move a shit ton more copies then they would if they just kept ignoring Nintendo since it's been too underpowered.  Performance of Switch hadn't been irrelevant the past six years, and performance of Switch 2 won't be irrelevant moving forward.


Not only that, but Nintendo, their EPD teams, Monolith and Retro Studios are Optimisation Gods. Their 1st party games having access to Series S tier specs + amazing art direction + DLSS tech to run games at natively lower resolutions but higher display resolutions means we're going to see some ground breaking levels of polish,

Obviously it won't be as good as actual PS5 exclusives. 

But I don't think people here are ready to see just how big the leap in visuals is going to be. The next Mario, Zelda, Metroid and Xenoblade games are going to make people shit themselves.


https://www.polygon.com/23844411/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-series-x-release-date-2023

Microsoft and Larian are committed to working on providing split screen support on the Series S post launch. Per that thread. I trust Larian on this and if they can't deliver split screen then I know they'll at least tell us why and just not say anything about it.


Sweet baby Jesus, even reaching the power of ps4 pro would be nice at this point honestly


Unless the Switch 2 has 5-minutes battery life, there's no way it's even close to PS5/XSX.


I mean... I'm sure it looks like that on a 7 inch screen, but they're not getting the performance of a PS5 in a 15w package. I'm sure it looks great, but it's not magic.


i definitely agree that it doesnt have to be. but saying that it is would be quite a bold claim. Nintendo has never really prioritized cutting edge so it would be a significant shift in focus. would be super cool tho.


Also 60fps or more


The issue is that nintendo gets away with their current development strategy because they use charming art direction rather than intense graphics to provide a visually impressive experience.  Good art design and direction is much cheaper and less time intensive than high end graphics.  In a sense they are competing asthetic goals.  Just like realism and impressionism, hi-fi video games and nintendo asthetics are competing ideas.


Emulation isn't a thing because Nintendo systems aren't powerful, Nintendo could easily get more games running on the switch with vc. They just don't.


I honestly didn’t feel the performance issues as much as I did with BOTW, which was horrible for me.  I definitely agree I’d love to see it perform better, but I stop short of calling it “rough.”


They're waiting for the right opportunity to.  You don't want to jump the gun.  Consider that reason the Switch was so successful because in its first year it had two blockbuster 10/10 games in their most popular franchises, as well as loads of other fun games to fill in the gaps.  They need to ready up its successor to have a similar pipeline of games on the calendar before they launch it. Games they fully take advantage of the new hardware.  Apart from the Wii U being a marketing failure, it failed because it never had a solid lineup of must have games.  Nintendo can't make this same mistake with the Switch 2 and they won't.


Nintendo was pretty open about wanting 10 years out of the Switch. We are on the cusp of the 7th year soon. Assuming they announce in the spring, launch for holiday 2024 that still leaves 3 years where they will passively support the Switch.


Even with DLSS. Steamdeck is roughly as powerful as a 720p ps4 while being way bulkier and more expensive.

I get that ARM is more efficient and DLSS can help but ps5 levels of performance would be insane in a device with similar size to the switch.


You don't need resolutions that high in a small screen.


If they can catch up to Steam Deck that's already part way there


You can overclock the shit out of it when docked. I can see nintendo offering a docked 60fps mode or something.


No, it's a handheld AND a plugged in console. Maybe it could match current gen when docked.


No one should expect this console to be on par with current gen. Especially based on second hand account of a demo looking good. 

Will be great if this has DLSS as that would do a lot of heavy lifting.


Thats fine, most games are still made with PS4 in mind.


These conversations always leave out the fact that every handheld release during that time did perfectly well.

Nintendo was in zero danger during that time period, they had a strong lineup of first party titles and at least one section of their hardware was consistently selling well


Okay, that makes Sense. Thank you for the clarification, it wouldn’t have come to me otherwise


The PSTV was a (badly marketed) off shoot of a system that already sold poorly. There's certainly a market for people who want to play Nintendo's games but don't want to pay $350 for an OLED or even $200 for Lite.


As already said, the PSTV was based on the PSVita, which already didn't sell well. And a lot of the PSHandheld titles were physical releases, that the PSTV didn't support and weren't on PSN.

A SwitchTV would sell fine, there shouldn't be a need for it to be a top-seller outside of it being profitable enough. And the point wasn't about success, just that this is not a new idea.


Multimedia Hexahedron.


Bolder prediction: They add a camera for AR stuff and call it the Snap.

It's just the right amount of stupid gimmick that nobody asked for.


Switch SU, standing--for some reason--for Switch Super U.


New Switch XL U


the lack of those ports is driving me insane. the wii u gamepad is literally just a menu, and you can play without it just fine already. and nintendo has done direct 32-bit wii u ports plenty. wtaf is going on with these games


Yup. I enjoy(ed) my Wii U, but 90% of that enjoyment was games being good, nothing about the hardware. I'd say the only times I liked the hardware being what it was was for Nintendoland, and swapping items in Zelda without pausing. Windwaker was way better when I could swap items while sailing before I landed at my next spot.


I absolutely HATE the wii u gamepad just because you NEED one to set up a console or change the settings. This is already a bit of a problem in the second hand market because people are more likely to lose/break a gamepad than the actual console. And the protocol thats used between the gamepad and the wii u still hasn't been cracked/emulated so you can't just get a chinese clone or do some homebrew stuff.

(And they're region locked for no reason at all. If you use a homebrew/dev tool you can even change the region of a gamepad. But that requires an already homebrewed wii u)


I never mentioned the hardware specifically. That's not what Nintendo never was famous for. It was the games. And they games were seriously lacking for Wii U. Both first party and third party.


I'd say one of the worst blows to the WiiU was that the one game that was going to best make use of the gimmick, BotW, was so clearly redesigned to no longer do so. Personally speaking, I feel like it's super obvious that originally the Sheikah Slate was supposed to be used in real time(so you could use abilities, inventory etc. from the slate while you played). But when they decided to make it a switch game that functionality was shelved.

&#x200B;

This is a pure guess, and I might be wrong on this, but I'm personally pretty certain of it. Not saying that this functionality was implemented and then shelved mind you, just that I am certain that's what the original concept was, it might not ever have been actually usable for the game before they decided to make it a switch game.


The 3DS became really huge after the price drop, though.  The Wii U... did not.
