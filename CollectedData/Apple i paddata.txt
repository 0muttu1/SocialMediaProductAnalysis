Ngl it looks like a fake screen. Just a photo


I would imagine it's just a iso launcher


Ofcourse not. It's android with a IOS skin


Edited spelling errors lol. Bro. Do you even understand any of what you said. You don't jailbreak an Android. You can root an Android. You can also install a custom ROM. Typically people do this when phones are no longer supported in further updates so a custom ROM is usually built to bring it to the present. You're onto the right direction it's most likely a shitter Android tablet with an iOS skin slapped on it. You can jailbreak an iPhone. It's really the only thing that has used that terminology other than PlayStations. The PS3s ran complete cfws so I consider that more of a softmod than a jailbreak. The PS4 is actually a jailbreak situation. You open up a website and use a WebKit to get into the software and run unsigned code. I'm not tryna come across as asshole and I definitely can come across strong so I'm sorry if you take this badly. I just want you to understand what you're saying. Just tryna inform you on the information you're speaking on. Much love. Have a great day night

>This little Lightroom vignette is basically the story of the iPad Pro: either you have to understand the limitations of iOS so well you can make use of these little hacks all over the place to get things done, or you just deal with it and accept that you have to go back to a real computer from time to time because it’s just easier. And in that case, you might as well just use a real computer.

Story of my life trying to use an iPad Pro for university this year. Light as a feather, a joy to use. Never runs out of batteries.

But holy fuck is it limited. In the end I preferred carrying my shitty old laptop, power charger and all.


"The iPad pro is still just an accessory to my laptop, not a replacement for it." :(


Solid review by The Verge.


We just need to hope that iOS 13 makes the New iPad Pro a real laptop replacement. The hardware is there but the software simply isn’t adapted for what Apple advertises it for.


The ability to tap the Pencil on the screen and jump directly to Notes has been around for years. Strangely since Apple highlighted this again in the Keynote people have been saying what a great new feature it is. Highlights how people that comment on the iPad seem to barely use the iPad.


**TLDR criticisms**

* No headphone jack
> *which is a curious omission since.. so many pro media workflows demand low-latency audio monitoring*

* No read/write on external storage
> *This $1899 tablet simply won’t talk to a flash drive*

* Photos import is a hassle
> *You are required to import to the system camera roll — you can’t import photos directly into an app like Lightroom CC.*
> *iOS PhotoKit API only allows apps to grab one or the other from the camera roll. So I could only import my RAW images into Lightroom, leaving the JPGs behind to clutter up my camera roll*

* Can't watch 4K videos on YouTube
> *Apple refuses to support Google’s VP9 video codec, so there is literally no way to watch YouTube in 4K on the iPad Pro*

Great review. I can't see myself buying a $1000 device just to do iPad stuff.


Not supporting external storage is ridiculous. What’s the point of moving to USB-C then? At the current stage IOS is at I don’t think this Ipad is worth it.


The conclusion:

>But if you’re thinking about spending $799 on the cheapest 64GB 11-inch iPad Pro to replace your laptop, you should really ask yourself what you need a computer to do. There isn’t a single other tablet on the market that can compete with the raw hardware of the iPad Pro, and there aren’t many laptops that can either. But Apple’s approach to iOS is holding that hardware back in serious and meaningful ways, and while USB-C makes life with this new iPad Pro slightly easier, it still has the same basic capabilities and limitations of last year’s iPad Pro.

>Is the new iPad Pro a stunning engineering achievement? Without question. Has Apple once again produced mobile hardware that puts the rest of the industry to shame when it comes to performance, battery life, and design? Yep. Is the iPad Pro the best, most capable iPad ever made? It certainly is.

>But you know what? It’s still an iPad.

That's the long winded version of what I said in another thread about whether or not I was excited about the iPad.

https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9uc9dr/anyone_else_ridiculously_excited_for_their_ipad/

>Nothing changed about iOS from before the iPad Pro announcement to now.

>There are still a bunch of things in iOS that prevent me from buying an iPad.

>Now before I get downvoted into oblivion, note that I love my MacBook Pro.

>I need my MacBook Pro to do everything I need to do.

>Would I love to buy a $999 iPad Pro instead of a $3,000 laptop?

>You bet your ass, but we're not there yet.


The performance of the 2018 iPad Pros is ridiculous. I do think it seems a bit wasted, when there aren’t many apps that can take advantage of it. I’m hoping iOS will eventually support development environments, so you can program and compile your code natively on the iPad Pro.

The only problem with 2018 iPad Pros, is the $150 increase in base starting price, and the removal of the headphone jack.

The $30 price increase for the 2018 Apple Pencil is also disappointing. But the charging mechanism, is a much needed improvement.

For people who already have a workflow that requires the iPad Pros’ performance, and the Apple Pencil, this is worth it.

If you’re the type of person who buys a MacBook, for light document editing, photo editing, etc, and use it mainly as a glorified web browser, I can see the 2018 iPad Pros as being worth it. As you’ll being spending a similar amount of money either way, there won’t be a real change in your device usage, you gains some versatility through the Apple Pencil, and you get a more powerful device.



It's time for iPadOS...


Great review.  Exactly how I feel about it.  I'm really fucking tired of feeling constricted by iOS in a "pro" environment.  Just make a damn iOS/MacOS hybrid for this thing already.

Who exactly is the target market for this product?  I really have no idea.  Flashy photographers who want a fancy accessory?  Professional garage band music editors who would work without real studio headphones?  I just don't get it.


iOS 12 was supported to be a redesign but they held off. Maybe iOS 13 will be? 
If it is I hope the iPad has more iPad features. 


Remember when the iPad Air 2 came out and it was suspiciously overpowered? Well then we got snap side-by-side app multitasking the next version of iOS. They’ve probably got something big planned for next year considering iOS 12 was just optimizations, stability, bug fixes. 


When the iPad Pro 12.9" came out I used that as my only personal computer. I did a job search, changed jobs, and sold a house with only my iPad Pro. Yes iOS has limitations, but once you understand the workflows it absolutely can be used as a laptop replacement *for some people.* If you're a programmer, no it won't work. It's not a 100% solution but there is a substantial portion of the population who can get by with only an iPad.


We should honestly put together a list of everything missing from the iPad Pro's software

* Browser that defaults to desktop websites
* Safari extensions
* Advanced multitasking; Currently limited to 2 apps side by side. Apps have an annoying 0.5 second animation whenever you alt-tab.
* Lack of real file system means it's difficult to open related files of different file types (i.e. a spreadsheet, pdf and a Onenote page for biology homework) forcing users to open them separately in each program. If only iOS had some way of remembering "projects" its users were working on. 
* Inability to use external storage due to lack of file system
* Lack of desktop powered apps
* Office on iOS missing a lot of desktop Office features
* No 4k Youtube support
* General lack of customisation
* Lack of cursor support
* Patchy USB-C support
* Inability to code apps


I have to say the ipad pro is the apple product i hate the most. I love the power this thing has. Its more powerful than my 2017 mbp. And its more portable. But they again put a blown up version of ios on this thing. Its frustrating to be honest. I dont know what to say at this point. Ios is an extremely limited platform for pros, especially developers. The way ios is locked down stands against everything people want for work. Im just waiting for the days when apple understands that ios in the form intended for iphones and cheaper ipads cannot serve professionals.

Edit: atleast for the love of god please add proper mouse and external monitor support. So that its possible to connect the device to an external monitor and then remote into other systems and do some work. Everytime i go out i look at my mbp and the ipad pro 2017 and i ask myself “can i go out with just the ipad this time”. And everytime its a no. What if i have to do more work than taking notes or opening a ppt. What if someone asks me to check a part of the code. Its so frustrating.


I don't understand why Apple doesn't do something like what Microsoft did with the Surface and make a touch screen friendly version of Mac OS. It's a joke to say the iPad pro is a PC replacement and for professionals when it's using a phone OS.


Ever since the cheapest iPads started supporting Pencil, I don’t understand who the Pro is for. I can’t imagine anyone getting any real work done on an iPad, so is it just a fancy machine to watch videos on? I just don’t see what an iPad Pro can do that the cheap $300 iPad can’t.

Why would anyone needing to do “Pro” work spend this much on an iPad and not just get a MacBook?


I think Nilay deducted one point just because of a lack of a jack. 


I love my 2017 ipad pro but when I need to get work done I go straight to my late 2013 13" rMBP.

Maybe someday they can merge into one system, but it still seems a long ways off...


Lack of file system support hurts but it is by far the biggest issue. The biggest issue is that apps are basically baby versions of their desktop counterparts. Even office apps like Pages have much more features on the Mac than on iOS. If you want the iPad to be a true PC replacement, at least give us everything the desktop version offers.

Also, Apple needs to keep the price in check. For the price of a 512GB iPad Pro you're better off buying a MacBook.


I am not sure how one can even call it a laptop replacement. I have tried using iPad 10.5 for a while now. It doesn’t work. Basics like accessing file systems, reading external drives, a full desktop browser are not available. It’s a shame that all the power it packs is held back by iOS. There’s no reason to expand its capabilities at this point. 


This reminds me of Steve Jobs' analogy about trucks: Cars are like automobiles. At one time, most people bought trucks, because they needed them for agriculture. Now some people have trucks, some cars, some motorcycles. Because they all have different needs. The iPad pro is a super-powerful motorcycle: A super-powerful blast for some very specific things. 

I need a truck 90% of the time, and a motorcycle on weekends to play around with. So I have a top of the line Macbook Pro, and an entry level iPad. Couldn't be happier. 




Very valid criticisms. Something tells me this iPad was made for iOS13.


[deleted]


Hopefully Apple makes a variant of iOS, like iOS Pro for example, just for Pro iOS machines like this iPad.

But there is only ONE Pro iOS machine


I get the impression that this iPad Pro is a testbed for an ARM MacBook. The hardware is so robust, they can just slap this into a MacBook shell with an ARM-based MacOS and they’ll have an extremely powerful, low-cost laptop. 


I like Andy Inhatko’s comment, “The iPad Pro is suspiciously powerful...” I anticipate big things from iOS 13. I also think the mythical blending of iOS and MacOS will happen once the Macs can use apple’s own chips. Once that happens I bet the devices, Macs, iPads, and iPhones will live on a continuum of form factors but with similar OSes. Will some of them be more limited than others? I think iOS 13 will give us a glimpse of the future when it comes to what Apple has in mind for the iPad as well as the Mac. 


I think it's obvious the Surface Pro devices (and the copycats out there) have pushed Apple in this regard, and I'm very hyped about the possibilities. I don't think Apple would be touting iPad as a computer replacement if SP didn't exist.

However, I think that Apple will continue to keep iOS 'weak' because they don't want an obvious one-size-fits-all device purchase. If the iPad could seriously replace a MacBook Air, why would I buy a MacBook Air? Apple doesn't want to make an iPad device that can *actually* replace your computer. They want you to have to make a really tough choice, but still be invested in their product. The Apple die-hards will keep buying one of everything, but consumers have to decide. And Apple is trying to keep it so that your average consumer will *WANT* one of each device, and then maybe decide to get both.


[deleted]


Reading the comments and I’m glad I’m not alone. The fact that the iPad Pro is running iOS is the only thing holding me back from getting one 


[removed]


I understand they’re completely different, the Surface is a literal computer running a full OS. But if Apple is pushing the iPad Pro to be the “future of portable computers” by adding software support for things like the Microsoft Office Suite and Adobe Photoshop now, why not at least give us the option to have mouse support? We’ve already got full keyboard support. . .

*if these questions sound ignorant I’m sorry. Just seems to me like if we have keyboard support, then having mouse support shouldn’t be that difficult. Not saying it has to be a focus, the focus is touchscreen capable, just have the option for both mouse and touch? Is it a matter of it’s not that simple with the OS to add mouse support or that Apple just doesn’t want there to be a mouse option and just focus on touch?


I also somewhat agree with the article, imo it’s the lack of an actual file system and other “pro” apps which could make it not a full “laptop replacement”. 


Exactly my concerns for it.  It’s a *great* iPad.  But it’s not a laptop replacement, and I need a laptop. 

I do think iOS 13 could fix much of this, if they build a better desktop environment.  But I’m going to wait until then before I pull the trigger on one of these things considering the ridiculous price. 


One of the biggest shortcomings of iOS is no multi-user or profile support. 



For me, it has to be able to have built in screen sharing with a Mac so I can help family members when they get into a bind. THEN I can replace my Mac with an iPad pro. 

That's all that's missing for me. 


Come on iOS 13 and USB C. Time for a file explorer and USB C thumdrives


Which is basically a larger iPhone. Why does everyone assume we want to work of damned tablets? I want proper function AND portability and the iPad Pro does none of that. 


This was a fantastic video. The story waa very well told.

Answer : Its not for me right now.


Probably one of the best and fairest Apple reviews I've seen from Nilay in a long time. Nothing he said was a surprise to me personally, but I think it's good that reviewers are being clear about what iOS' limitations are as a computer.

I suspect that Apple is making incremental changes to address a lot of the limitations that he brought up (but not all of them, because Apple is Apple and the iPad will probably always require some user adaptation), but right now the iPad is in a sort-of awkward state between being a very power computer and a tablet. Personally, I am happy with where it is for the most part; I want a tablet first/laptop second, which is why solutions like the Surface aren't for me. But that's not sufficient for everyone, and Nilay's review did a great job highlighting the limitations while not really bashing the iPad.

All in all this is the kind of review that I think anyone who hasn't already decided if they're going to buy it or not, especially over a laptop, needs to see. Cheers to The Verge for a thorough, honest, and nice-looking review. 

I can't wait to pick up my 11" iPP on Wednesday.

EDIT: Finally someone talked more in-depth about the folio case! I am disappointed that you can't seem to origami it into a stand with the keyboard in the back like you can the current smart keyboard covers, but I sure like the way it looks.


The 2018 iPad Pro is probably the single most perfect technology device available today for doing what it's designed to do. But it's designed to be a media consumption tablet with a few laptop-like features stapled on top. It's also the single technology device limited the most by it's lack of functionality. It's a damn shame. 

It's like a Ferrari 812HP v12 engine being locked inside a washing machine. Yea, that washing machine is going to throttle your clothes until they are clean. But it's a washing machine, who cares?


Honestly even more than the file management, what I need for an iPad to truly replace my computer is a desktop class browser. Chromebooks are much closer at fully replacing my computer and that's because of desktop class Chrome.


I mean, this seems pretty self explanatory lol. It’s an iPad Pro with smaller bezels. It looks cool and it futuristic and all, but it isn’t a groundbreaking feature for the pro user like say, reading external drives would.


> A Native Instruments Maschine mk3 audio controller sat in silence. 

Yeah, that’s because the Controller doesn’t support the iPad and Maschine Studio is not aviable for iPad right now. Stupid point.


I would pull the trigger on an iPad Pro as my primary work computer if it had a real file system, support for multiple instances of the same app (multiple word/excel docs for me) and a support for a mouse or external pointing device. I'd even pull the trigger without the last part, honestly. 

I'm wanting to make that leap, but the limitations in the OS make it a non-starter for me. 


Exactly what I've been saying. iPads are great support devices for a regular computer but there's no way most people could switch to using an iPad as their sole computer—most people will have an iMac or MacBook or some form of Mac OS device at home.


They should compete with Wacom. 


I'm always amazed when someone buys something and then wants it to be something else. I guess in this case the person didn't buy it, but my comment holds true for this review. Nilay maintains that at the price point Apple is charging that there's no way to look at it as anything other than a laptop replacement. Um, not true at all. BMW motorcycles cost as much as a car and no one views those as something that has to be a car replacement. Both are transportation vehicles, but entirely different use cases.

I have an iPad Pro 2018 on order and I also ordered a new MacBook Air. They are two different tools and bemoaning one isn't more like the other misses the whole point if you ask me.

And in that case, you might as well just use a real computer.


I mean...that's good.


Great title folks


Is 64 gb enough for daily use?like watching videos, taking notes, editing pdf files etc.


It's an amazing piece of hardware, that allows creative people to create and is a great platform for both entertainment and education.

It's perfect for its niche.


As someone who has both surface Pro and ipad pro, I can confidently say the iPad is much more reliable and worthwhile product as a whole with much smoother and well working apps. If we talk about the most basic things basic consumer like me do, iPad blows surface out of the park. That being said the single most value on the surface is work space. I put all my photos, files, emails, videos etc. On my surface because its easier to do so and work with them on the surface. The keyboard on the surface is now cheaper and significantly better than what apple offers. I love my iPad much more than my surface. But I use surface much more than my iPad because of the OS limitations. 

Irony is that Microsoft has to make surface more streamlined like iPad with less buggy Tablet mode and push developers for more app support and apple has to make iPads more useful like the surface with more open OS and better keyboard. 


Verge really likes to be edgy when it comes to Apple. 

Mark my words, once folding phones release verge will start pushing the narrative how the iPad’s days are numbered and folding phones are the future of tablet computing.


Apple has zero excuses not supporting external storage. It is just pointless at this point when you pay at least 800 USD for a powerful machine but being limited at such a simple task. 




All I want for the iPad is to have a proper file system. In an ideal world we only have to AirDrop files but I still work with Windows people and it’s a pain to get files from them. We don’t have the luxury of always on internet. I live in the third world. 


The article speaks the truth, I couldn't agree more.

I was initially ecstatic that iPad had everything we ever wanted; USB-C, sleek Pen, quick charge and the keyboard.

But! iOS has sadly crippled its full potential. Multitasking is still a pain, and I can't edit videos on full-fledged apps. All I want is a macOS on this thing and I'll buy it, no doubt.

Remember, we're paying at least 3 times the price over other brands and therefore deserve the best!


The day "Finder" is added to the iPad is the day **in my opinion** it can actually replace a laptop.


Really curious as to what Apple's plan is for this thing with iOS 13. Now more than ever, it seems as though the software is holding back Apple's most advanced hardware, by far. The processor is stupid fast, it has a good chuck of RAM attached to it, the display is absolutely killer, small bezels, improved methods of attaching keyboards, a pencil that has been thought-through this time and they moved the port to USB-C to help it connect to the wider world of peripherals easier. Hardly anything in iOS 12 takes advantage of this stuff in a way thats meaningfully better than its predecessor. In terms of the performance you can get out of this thing at this point, I feel that the price is justified. It will be faster than any laptop Apple will sell you in the $1000-$1400 range. Problem is just that you just can't do as much on this as a laptop, still. Yes, its almost a given that Apple will improve the experience of using it next year, but this is way too much money to take a semi-blind leap of faith that it will get better...eventually. This is the first iPad Pro I've been genuinely interested in and I'll be buying one at the beginning of next year to check out and try to use to the fullest for my workload, but trust me, I will be keeping the receipt handy. 


There are SO few things Apple needs to do to make this thing a true laptop replacement but they still refuse to. I pre-ordered one but I'll still have to carry a laptop around for the things iPad can't do. That being said if you're in life science/medicine the computing demands of the field aren't too great (unless you're in research) so for the longest time I've been able to rely on my iPad a lot more than most people otherwise would. What I don't like about the iPad is that its usefulness is solely dependent on workflow, whereas laptops can be adapted to so much more. 


I've always enjoyed having a surface pro 3. Battery isn't the best, but it's a full laptop. I can run fusion 360 and Matlab on it with no problems


Finding out about lesser known apps & knowing which to run for what you want to accomplish really helps.

I’ve found that most university websites use Flash & Puffin Browser ([free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puffin-web-browser/id472937654?mt=8)  or [paid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puffin-browser-pro/id406239138?mt=8) ) works amazingly well by routing the website through their servers before sending it to the iPad.

Note taking just can’t be beat with [Notability](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notability/id360593530?mt=8): Typing, writing, drawing, highlighting, simultaneous audio recording, active highlighting with audio playback, and recently introduced handwriting recognition, handwriting to text conversion, and split-screen dual note taking – totally worth every cent.


It’s still just a high powered YouTube machine for my toddler. And a slightly less casual gaming console than my phone. But it is hands down my favorite way to reddit. 


That's just sad.


Same. Not exactly my case since it does everything I need for Uni, but I still use my computer for personal things like music production or heavy video/photo editing.


It’s a perfect companion device. I could do fantastic with it for part of my business but the rest of it absolutely needs a desktop or laptop.


May iOS 13 save our souls.


Why are people so upset with this? Are you not happy with your macbook?


Ain't that the truth.  


It’s so true. I love my iPad Pro but I would never let go of my MacBook for it. A Mac/PC just has too much flexibility and professional capabilities.  


Yeah, as someone who’s super pro-iPad, they have a completely fair take that will be useful for a lot of people. 

Personally, I can’t see myself upgrading from a 2015 Pro until iOS demonstrates that it could really use the A12X power more effectively 


They've been so solid recently. Really in depth but also adequately addressing shortcomings. 


I think it’s quite striking to think that iPad has reached a point where the software is limiting is capabilities, not the hardware.


[deleted]


They’ve got to speed up the pace of iOS development for the iPad if they want consumers to believe it’s the future of the computer. 

It’s the slowest developed platform OS in their ecosystem because the iPhone pulls all of the focus every year.

iOS 9 and 11 were big steps forward but unless I’m missing something it seems crazy to then take a year off in between.


Or, iPadOS, a hybrid ios/macOS built for the iPad. 


[removed]


Every year, this same thing is said. 


iPad's biggest downside is iOS. Very disappointing when you look at the amazing hardware it has.


The iPad already has hardware faster than most Windows notebooks. But iOS remains a Fisher-Price mobile operating system taking baby steps to adopt desktop-like capabilities. There's nothing inherently wrong with that—except if you're trying to position the product as a laptop replacement.


The software has always been not quite there for a while now. Even the previous iPad Pros had incredible hardware. It’s the software holding back the iPad.


I‘m sure at this point Apple has heard the complaints loud and clear. I’m looking forward to WWDC next year.


The usually-correct Mark Gurman has said as much; big iPad update in iOS 13 with stuff like a proper file manager, homescreen revamp, etc. Still made sense to launch the new Pros as soon as they were ready, but the real story isn't going to be complete until next June.


I doubt it, that would be such a big change. It can get it much closer to a laptop replacement, but that is too much to expect.


The fact that 3rd party app developers are spending time and effort creating ways to do things that 'fit ios' - makes me doubt that. 

I think Apple is going to spend a couple more years making the software bend to their will rather than being truly adaptable.  I think Apple cherishes their walled garden more than it values users being productive.


I don’t understand this whole laptop replacement thing. When you attach a keyboard to an iPad why not just have a laptop??


I don’t quite understand the benefits of an iPad becoming a laptop replacement? By the time you get the keyboard it’s almost the same price, weight and size as some of the MacBooks you can buy. 

Everyone is caught up on wanting the iPad to replace a computer, but why? 


It's not even close.  They need to scrap both iOS and macOS and create a unified alternative that can adapt to a range of devices.  It's so clear that they just aren't fully committed to either.  


MobileSafari is still the weakest link.  You can’t do anything remotely useful with it.  


is macOS that bad that you want to replace it? 

I don't understand why people want a replacement for laptops.

> No read/write on external storage

This is downright embarrassing when you look at Android: you can connect a USB Hub to a Galaxy S8/S9/Note/whatevs and have a USB keyboard, mouse, SD card and external SSD connected all at the SAME TIME without external power and basically transform your phone into a mobile workstation with proper mouse input and file management.

Apple really, really needs to step up iOS if they truly want the iPad to be adopted by professionals as a "laptop replacement".


You CAN watch 4K videos. Just not through YouTube. 

So yes you can watch 4K HDR movies. 


[deleted]


No headphone jack is a killer for me. It’s fine on my iPhone but with traveling and work and studying, plugging in my nice headphones is a must. 


iPad pro doesn't support 4K anyway does it?


>	Can’t watch 4K videos on YouTube
>
>	Apple refuses to support Google’s VP9 video codec, so there is literally no way to watch YouTube in 4K on the iPad Pro


What’s the reason about this ?


> Create a folder on device. Cannot be done. You can create folders in iCloud, you can create folders inside other apps folders but you can't go to local storage and create a folder for your stuff. Whats the point of 1TB internal storage?

I know this is just a lame workaround because this should be supported natively, but "Documents" by Readdle is MUCH better than the default Files app. You can create folders and such, but there are tons of options that don't exist in Files. Readdle is also a really solid developer (same guys did PDF Expert), so it's well polished and doesn't feel cheap. Also their software works really well together if you happen to have PDF Expert or their other software.

Lame we have to go 3rd party for this, but at least there's an option - however I think it might cost a few bucks (still worth it, plus I really like the developer).

> Cant connect Xbox controller - xbox quality games on a big beautiful screen? who needs the switch right? let me just connect the most popular gaming controller in the world... nope.

If Apple played their cards right they could basically turn the iPad Pro into a Nintendo Switch killer. I would love to be able to dock it to something that plugs into my TV and have all that power to play video games with something like an XB1 controller, then take it out on the go just like a Switch.


Edit just kidding I’m an idiot. Carry on. ~~You can actually use the newer Xbox One controllers that have bluetooth with iOS (according to a random google search, but it makes sense)~~


Exactly why I cancelled mine. It was just to hard to justify $1900, for a 256 GB with the keyboard, pen, and apple care. Especially when I already have a surface pro. 


Current stage iOS for iPad is just a blown up version of that for iPhone.


Managing files from external storage would be game changing. Being able to edit photos and videos without having to import to local storage would be an absolute leap in the capabilities. I love my iPad Pro 9.7 for photo and video editing (it’s honestly more capable than my 2012 MacBook Pro), and is iOS 13 let’s you read files off storage through USB-C without having to use the internal storage, I would think about upgrading 


[deleted]


I think these new iPads switched to USB-C because of the postponed big iOS feature update. But since this update got pushed from iOS 12 to 13 the change seems random. The hardware couldn’t be changed in time so USB-C was left in. Next year the change to USB-C will make more sense with iOS 13.


Yup. If Apple want to market the iPad Pro as the laptop replacement, then they better make sure it can be a laptop replacement. It currently isn't for majority of the users.


How does the $1000 iPad compare to the $1000 MacBook is my question.  When it comes to speed, applications, etc. 


It’s not a laptop replacement until you can run Xcode, Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro. As well as other 3rd party software development tools and access to physical storage. Them files get huge when dealing with media. 


For a lot of people, we’re there. The iPad was not ment for you as a laptop replacement. You are not Apples target audience for this. Apple has their eyes on the current and future generations who are growing up on iPhones and iPads.  Thats who the laptop replacement is for.  Yes, iPad is there for a growing number of users who grew ip on desktops/laptops who just want to accomplish basic task  


Yup. I'm trying to sell my older iPad Pro to buy a MacBook to be able to do minor work when I need to. It's just not easy with iOS and it ends up being just faster doing things on my phone vs my iPad anyways that it's just collecting dust. 


Do you know if you get a Lightning to USB-C adapter with the new one? 


For those use cases a 400 dollar chromebook is a better investment. Keyboard, touchscreen, trackpad, etc. 


I just wish Apple would release a full version of Logic for the iPad Pro. I often record with the band I'm in and it's a pain in the ass bringing my MBP with me. It's clunky to use with just a trackpad, but with the right implementation gestures would be absolutely awesome in Logic. Pinch/zooming tracks, using the Pencil to draw in automation, using the faders sorta like real faders rather than dragging with a cursor, etc. 

They won't do it though because they want people like me to have to straddle both iOS and macOS. The iPad Pro is *easily* powerful enough. If they released Logic for the iPad then I'd be so happy that I'd shit rainbows and puppies.


Even most photographers wouldn’t use it because of the limitations on importing photos and there’s no full version of Lightroom Classic, Capture One, etc.


Wow you might have just convinced me to get a regular one. I don’t really need any of the new new stuff.


They announce that Apple was bringing iOS apps to the MacOS. Does that help? 


That’s my thought process. But as badly as i want the new iPad Pro, I can’t buy it based on what it could be. Only for what it is. Here’s to hoping for an amazing iOS update next year for the iPad 


> Advanced multitasking 

Including the inability to have two windows of the same app running side by side.  


&#x200B;

>No 4k Youtube support  
>  
>General lack of customisation  
>  
>Inability to code apps

&#x200B;

This really comes down to the same thing - apple locking the software side as much as possible. Youtube requires extra video libraries, software development requires frameworks, and dev tools that get into the system much deeper than candy crush etc. You can't even officially download a gameboy emulator...

&#x200B;


Once you add that (especially cursor support and coding apps) it just becomes a macbook.


i can deal with less than half of all that. If iPad Pro supported the first five bullet points you listed above, i would be happy as a clam replacing my MBP with an iPad Pro... it's the glaring limitations of iOS that prevents me from doing so. I don't need cursor support. I don't need 4K youtube. most of the apps that i use (personally) would be sufficient with the iOS version. but the lack of file access and rudimentary multitasking features prevents me from doing so. 

so frustrating since the hardware itself is pretty much damn near perfect. 

i wont be getting one. i want to so badly, but i cant justify the cost. i can always wait for iOS 13 and see what Apple brings to the table, but deep down, i know i wont be holding my breath either.

I have a Surface Pro (2 actually - Pro 4 and 2017) and it mostly sucks as a touch device. Its problems have very little to do with hardware though, and everything to do with poor UI adaptation in Windows.

iPad Pro also looks like a huge bag full of compromises but MacOS and Windows 10 start from different points, so Surface and iPad Pro compromises are different. The end goal I think is a desktop OS that seamlessly adapts to pen, touch, voice and mouse/keyboard input depending on what you do and then learns to switch over time to anticipate what the user intends to do.

So for iPad Pro I kinda feel like iOS and MacOS need to merge into one thing with context sensitive UI switching on the fly.

Windows starts in a very different place. It is built on layers upon layers of legacy features, workflows and menus so if you want to do something like add a printer, theres like 3 different ways to do it. When you right click theres like 4 different shell menus depending on where you do it. This happened to preserve backwards compatibility, legacy programs and legacy workflow. It is the reason there are so many apps for Windows, maintained over such a long time, but its also the reason why the visual design is really inconsistent and at times downright confusing. Context sensitive UI switching is literally the most important thing for Surface functionality imho.

UI adaptation is something MS refers to as "Continuum" but it is progressing at a glacial pace. In some ways, Windows 8/metro was much better at touch adaptation and some things got lost in the transition to Windows 10. The most significant updates to Windows 10 are more about improving the visual appeal of Windows (via Fluent Design).

But the struggle is real with Surface Pro. Its pretty crappy in tablet mode and does annoying things like auto lock orientation when the type cover is attached in portrait mode. And then it doesn't auto pop the on screen keyboard when holding it like a book because a keyboard is attached, even if the gyroscope/accelerometer tells the device that it is in portrait mode, therefore the keyboard is sideways and usable only as a book cover not as a typing keyboard. The UI doesn't adapt to that. Also the on screen keyboard is terrible. It needs a lot of work, but it does run full fat FL Studio and I can plug in an RME Fireface UC and UFX so I can field record with it and that is awesome.

iPad Pro I guess is converging on the same dream from the opposite angle. If MacOS and iOS were to merge in some fashion or other, iPad may end up with distinctly Surface like problems - UI that doesn't really adapt the way you want it to or think it intuitively should when you transition from pen to touch to mouse/keyboard.

We need the iPad Pro internals inside a MBP. :P


Except for digital artists, for every other use case MacBook is definitely the better buy. 


As a drawing device, I have not used anything better than the iPad Pro 12.9. It's so much better than my Cintiq 16 for actually drawing.


I would have too. I don’t mind too much on the iPhone, but I really think they should have kept it around on the iPad. 


It's ludicrous not to have them on all Mac and iPads.  People use these things for actual things and it's not like it's a space issue...


I don't even look at the score anymore to be honest.

I'm watching the video review on YouTube now, it's really, really good.


I would be more OK with removing the headphone jack if there were two USB-C ports on it instead of one, so you could charge and do audio input/output at the same time without a multi-adapter.


Except in this case Apple is marketing the iPad as a truck.

"The world is changing, I use my iphone/ipad as my main computing device". 

Read: I watch netflix while I take a shit. 


I work with storyboard artists that work exclusively on iPad Pro. 

Not all jobs are the same, and generally you pay for people's talent, not the equipment they use. 

If it does the job for them... why not? 


I mean, theres also 2017 iPad Pro


I would think Apple would want you to pick the iPad, then they make a cut from every purchase you make (apps, movies, games, etc.) whereas with the Air you can buy those things from non-Apple sources.


That's just environmentally wasteful.

When you say you're an artist, what do you mean? Do you work for a company or independently? Do you have deadlines or do you set your own?

I'm asking because as a designer I just can't comprehend how someone would replace his PC with an iPad. The workflow is much slower and inconvenient.


If you purchase your music and videos elsewhere than from Apple, and “host it” within another app (Readdle Documents, Amazon Music, etc.) you never have to use iTunes or a desktop.


Plus, a regular pc/mac keyboard isn't tied to the form factor of the device. When apple changes the iPad case design again, your 200 quid keyboard won't carry over.


You’re better off buying a Bluetooth keyboard for less. I never used the new keyboard but I had the Smart Keyboard and the Logitech Create Keyboard for the older iPad Pro and thy were both horrible. The Smart Keyboard was horrible to type on and the Create Keyboard was huge, bulky, and it’s hard to attach and remove the iPad to it. If the new Folio Keyboard is anything like the Smart Keyboard then I’m gonna bet it will be horrible too. 


This /\


YES! ever since chrome made remote screen sharing easy, life has been much easier fixing family computers. 

TeamViewer isn’t as easy to setup, but at least it is an option for most major Android brands (Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola) expect for Google Pixel (wtf Google).

IPads and iPhones are still advance enough that family members are constantly getting themselves in trouble. It would be nice if I can remote in and fix the problem in a few second/minutes instead of having to visit them physically.





As a graphic designer I got one to replace my Wacom, but I don’t intend it to replace my desktop; I need that for all the ‘real’ work.

Yes.  That sounds familiar.


Even monstrously big PDF files which are basically a collection of images instead of a proper file are perfectly fitting a 64 GB device.


Honestly that’s where Apple needs to go with the iPad. Consolidate the code base for Mac OSX and iOS and allow for the “tablet view” to be iOS and the computer view being Mac OSX that would be the best solution imo. I like what MS did even though their tablet view is pretty lacking. It serves the purposes of having a tablet.

This sounds a lot like OneNote to me?



Let’s be real.

The vast majority of users you see irl using an iPad in the wild are either:

A) infants
B) seniors
C) Tim Cook 


Yeah, my iPad pro is solely for studying, taking notes in lecture, and doing board questions. For that it's perfect. 


Just add a proper filesystem support along with a cursor and that thing will make billions. 


Been there with iOS 7 so hf waiting :D


I think we should just let iOS 13 be what it wants to be. The community is expecting a lot of things out of it and I’m afraid they might be disappointed when it’s announced. 


Are there any rumors/indications that iOS 13 will make the iPad more capable?


Multiuser support ain’t coming. It will never be anything more than a second screen without it. 


Because the ipad is absolutely lovely and much more pleasant to use than a macbook. It would be great to be able to do more with it. For example:

* full desktop safari for web apps
* file management via external hard drive
* trackpad support for some specific use cases. (I'm less bothered by this one)
* Xcode or some officially supported way to program

None of those need change what the ipad is, but they would let it do a lot more. 


Because Apple is marketing it as the next generation of computing. In reality it's barely at parity. One step forward, three steps back.


It's more like Apple is charging for its potential, but then not allowing the iPad Pro to meet it.

It's called the iPad Pro.  As the Verge showed, with accessories the highest end iPad Pro rivals the Macbook Pro in price.  Its SoC is getting to be the same or better performance as full x86 CPUs (if you ignore thermal limitations and OS/software limitations).  

But its OS doesn't allow it to be used like a Macbook Pro.  So unless you have professional needs that specifically match up to what the iPad Pro can do (art and maybe some graphical design, typing with minimal editing needs, etc) you're having to fight the device the whole way.  Or at least adjust the way you use the device to what it can do.  And for that amount of money, that shouldn't be the case.

Or, if you want the iPad to be a compliment to the Mac, don't charge Mac pricing and hype up its abilities.


People are not happy with MacBooks. The lines are confusing and too expensive to get what you want with prices increasing every year and usability dropping. Less ports, bad keyboard, no use for touchbar. 

Apple is emphasizing iOS and the pro iPad as a computer, but it’s not a full computer. 


For me it's just that the iPad is so tantalizingly close to offering the perfect thing for my job and they just are really dragging their feet on moving it forward the last miles with only offering biannual updates to iPad productivity.  

&#x200B;

Like overwhelmingly I prefer the iPad but for me the lack of a desktop browser means I need one.  


Why do I need a MacBook?

At work I want a powerful desktop, and if I have a MacBook for work it spends all day sitting docked anyway. 

In meetings I can’t take notes on a MacBook. 

A MacBook isn’t as powerful as my desktop, I still need to offload computationally expensive tasks. 

It’s fucking heavy.  

It’s in between and the clamshell is so dated. 

I want powerful desktops work. Tablets for travel / presentations / etc. 

Why is the iPad so gimped?


My wife saw the announcement and teasers and was all about upgrading from her original 12.9" iPad. I told her that at the current moment there isn't really anything of note that the new iPad could do that hers couldn't and it stopped her, with the only reason being a smaller footprint. 

I really hope iOS (or a separate tablet version OS) has updates that truly utilize the hardware that Apple has been manufacturing. I would absolutely love to replace my Dell laptop with an iPad Pro, but as a System Admin that is not happening any time soon. 


I think they (Nilay) seems to have taken on board the criticism and reacted to it well. Now if only they would stop with the BS social justice style reporting that seems to clutter their website so often that would be great.

Also means that iOS 13 is probably going to be a more iPad oriented update, but i wouldn’t mind file system access for devices like external hard drive/usb sticks. 

Photos + Files should eventually merge into iOS’ equivalent to Finder. 


The Photos app is a huge mixed bag. Apple nailed it with the iCloud sync feature. But the app itself is crude and overly simplistic, seeming like an iOS interface lazily copied over onto the Mac. This, I fear, will be the norm with future "Marzipan" apps ported over from iOS.

When Apple abandoned Aperture they seemed to telegraph that they're content with letting Adobe own the pro/prosumer market. But Adobe's ecosystem doesn't work with iCloud. It works with a competing, walled-off cloud service, and Adobe's user interfaces are anathema to Mac users.


I know it’s not the point, but I use an app call [Metapho](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metapho/id914457352?mt=8) that is used as an App Extension inside the Photos app to read all the meta data and even change it, it’s awesome! 


> They’ve got to speed up the pace of iOS development for the iPad if they want consumers to believe it’s the future of the computer.

iOS 11 was a pretty big leap, and we all knew that iOS 12 wasn't going to be bringing any major changes to either iPhones or iPads this year. 

I think it's just a byproduct of that really, and we should see more changes to both devices with iOS 13. 


[deleted]


I have a Surface Book and would love a hybrid Mac OS/iOS laptop. It’s Mac OS while docked but switches to the iOS UI when used as a tablet.

Just allow me to access my files in either form.


hehe PadOS


They need a single OS that adapts to whatever hardware.  If they don't do this, then iPads will *always* be the 'gimped' OS that will replace a traditional computer for professionals. 

Windows has been doing this for years and it completely works.  Whether I'm using Windows on a tablet or a desktop, there is a way for me to comfortably navigate the OS and I feel right at home regardless of the hardware.


[deleted]


 Apple recently announced they will no longer release sales totals for the different product lines, something that I strongly suspect they wouldn’t do if they weren’t anticipating those numbers going down.

You can buy an iPad (or even an iPhone) that costs more than a MacBook, so I’m sure their profit margins don’t care which route you go.


> So more power for consumers but less overall product sales for Apple. Is that a concern?

Nope. Apple has no concerns cannibalizing their own product lines when it deems necessary. If Apple had the opportunity, they will easily have iPad be the number one computing device and have customers replace their computers with one. 

Apple, for whatever reason, is holding back on the software. iOS is inherently flawed with a product like the iPad Pro. If they got rid of some of those limitations (branching out and having iPad have its own revised OS), it really does have the potential to becoming a product for the masses... 


Nonsense. Nothing would make Tim Cook happier than having everyone adopt iOS devices to replace Macs and MacBooks. He just happens to be smart enough to realize this isn't happening any time soon.


I actually think Apple would prefer people buy an iPad instead of a Macbook at similar prices.  With the iPad you are locked into the App Store so Apple makes a cut from every purchase you make.  On the Macbook you have way more freedom to buy apps from sources that Apple doesn't take a cut of.

iOS needs a handful of things to truly become Pro: Proper file management, a desktop class browser (like Chromebooks), and more pro apps that aren't watered down versions of their desktop counterparts.

Thanks, I should’ve took a second longer to think about it. 


Well it can. But only if you want to read photos or videos from that thumb drive. And don’t expect to write to the thumb drive.


I have one of those lightning Usb drives that work with a special app on any iPhone/ipad. You can use it to virtually transfer any file and import it into a documents app. I know sandisk makes a few of those


lol yes very annoying.  Right now I am so used to enabling airplane mode before I want to import RAWs from a card so that they don't upload to my cloud storage.


How well does that work if you want to edit and manage your photos with a more robust application than Photos? Apple killed Aperture, and Adobe doesn't support iCloud.


VP9 exists now. AV1 is very much in its development stages. Encoders and even decoders still are very inefficient to the point of being impractical. I'm not sure this changes even in time for iOS 13.

H.265 as supported by Apple right now is a patent minefield and I can totally see why google doesn’t want to support it on YouTube. 

If Apple was at all into providing a viable option for 4K videos they would bite the bullet and support VP9, possible patent issues be dammed (VP9 also is a patent minefield, but slightly less so than h.265 for non-MPEG-LA members)


Until that AV1 comes, why is it the problem for Apple to implement VP9 codec into MacOS/iOS? I mean, is it that huge work to do or there is something else at play?
 
 Just curious, have no idea how these things work.


They are leaps and bounds ahead in the hardware, but the software is clearly limiting what the iPad Pro can do.


> if they truly want the iPad to be adopted by professionals as a "laptop replacement".

Do they want that though? And why would they? They still have MacBooks to sell. 


Right, will update original comment


Will Netflix 4K work?


But the screen isn’t even 4K? I must be missing something, why is anybody talking about this? Is it because you film a video in 4K and want to see it, even though it’s not at its native resolution? 


What a bunch of shit....c'mon Apple!

The importing photos is the worst...


There will be a third party that designs a case/grip with a cutout for the apple pencil to charge, so that's not really much of an issue down the road.


> If Apple played their cards right they could basically turn the iPad Pro into a Nintendo Switch killer. I would love to be able to dock it to something that plugs into my TV and have all that power to play video games with something like an XB1 controller, then take it out on the go just like a Switch.


They cannot do that. The novelty of the Switch is not its portability but the fact that its a Nintendo device with first party Nintendo titles. The iPad wont be as good the other consoles either cause no matter how much power you pack into it running demanding games is gonna be a no go without some serious cooling solutions. So what we're gonna be left with is an iPad that is as/more capable than the Switch for gaming but has no games that you actually wanna play.


Nope. Xbox Controllers (even the updated ones) are not MFI certified so they're not compatible with iOS. It's possible to get them to work if you jailbreak your device and then sideload the drivers but it's far from easy especially on the latest hardware and software.


Off topic but the Surface Pro 6 not having TB3 let alone USB-C pisses me off


That's the sad part. The hardware has grown leaps and bounds. It's reached a point of maturity where it has the serious potential of becoming something absolutely great and shaking up the industry. 

There is nothing wrong with the iPad Pro itself. It's the software limitation that is holding it back. 


Multitasking (three windows open at the same time)? Picture-in-Picture? Drag'n'drop? Sure there's a long way to go, but iOS on ipad is definitely more than just a blown up veersion.


What app do you use for editing


>	The Apple Pencil is more expensive for no reason

The new Apple Pencil is shorter, has gestures enabled and can connect and charge magnetically and wirelessly respectively.


A 200 dollar Chromebook is a good iPad replacement


iPad Pro is much faster. MacBook is more capable.


iPad has better hardware, Macbook has better software. If you can live within the iOS limitations, the iPad is going to be an absolute joy to use every single time you pick it up. If you can't, well, then you're fucked.

Meanwhile, the MacBook is an actual personal computer, just like the ones you've probably been using for a decade or more. The MacBook is going to be limited in how you can use it because of the design limitations of Apple's hardware implementation, though. It's underclocked and will probably thermal throttle if you try to do too demanding a task on it.


The answer to this is similar to the larger sentiment. It's without a doubt faster and better hardware as a whole. But, there are still things you can do on a $1000 MacBook that you simply can't on *any* iPad. 


Everyone points to the “pro” applications to make the case that the iPad isn’t there, but I’d argue it’s not there for casual applications either. 

This review points out that Safari isn’t a desktop-class browser, so the web browsing experience is hobbled. 

Word works on the iPad, but it’s still an interface begging for a cursor. Sure, I could type out a paper in Word, but when it comes time to edit and format, I’m going back to a Mac. 

The file system is inflexible and opaque, so doing things like receiving a document via email, editing it, and uploading it to a submission service requires jumping through various individual apps possibly without a unified file system. 

Want to download a zip file? Sure, but good luck unzipping it. 

This is all basic stuff that a college student or professional who needs to write and submit a resume would need to do. But the iPad doesn’t make it easy. 

But if you want to browse reddit and watch Netflix, it’s great for that. If that’s being a laptop replacement, sure. 


Last time I checked, the younger generation still use USB sticks and external hard drives. Transferring files locally is hardly an advanced task.


$2000 machine for ‘basic tasks’




I see this argument a lot - but I wonder what happens when these folks "grow up" and try to do real work. I've never seen a YouTuber editing on an iPad (David Dobrik is always lugging around a Macbook Pro), I don't think CEO's of startups are running around managing major Excel sheets, etc on iPad. Programmers are definitely not using them yet.

There are still some major software problems to overcome - there was a reason why so many "professionals" were getting concerned about the state of the laptop and desktop lines.


> iPad **Pro**

Who is the audience then exactly?


[deleted]


The current and future generations need to write essays for school, and they don't want to flail with the mediocre Word iPad app or absolutely horrible Google Docs app. And their parents would much rather spend $200 on a full featured Chromebook or $500 on an actual Windows laptop than $200 on a smart keyboard connector


It seems a little strange to make a power house tablet just to do basic tasks. Why not buy an older or cheaper iPad if you’re just going to do basic tasks? It’s like buying your grandma an Alienware PC. It’s overkill. 


What’s a computer? 

But really, I’m more surprised that Apple hasn’t turned iOS or MacOS into a hybrid is yet. Surely they could make MacOS run on an ARM chip and then have it run a touch oriented shell that looks exactly like iOS today on iPhones and a more advanced touch ready mode for iPads. 

Google has Android and Linux apps running user ChromeOS, Samsung has Dex for when you plug your phone into an HDMI adapter, Microsoft had continuum years ago. 

Apple needs to get on the HybridOS train and and start blurring the lines. 

But we all know that while they won’t be first, they’ll likely be the ones that do it right. 


> Apple has their eyes on the current and future generations who are growing up on iPhones and iPads 

You know this makes no sense. Do you think desktop applications will not still be around when they are older? 

Even for basic tasks like word processing or email, they're sure as fuck not going to be using iPad pros with iOS in its current state as a workstation. It's inefficient to use it like that compared to a PC or a Mac. 

The only way that is happening is if iOS introduces more desktop features. 


> current and future generations who are growing up on iPhones and iPads. Thats who the laptop replacement is for

i know that folks are making EPs on their iphone - i think this is an achievement, but in the way that, say, eating 100 hot dogs is an achievement: it's amazing that someone did it, but it's still a dumb idea.


You don’t get a Lightning to USB Type-C adapter in the box


That may be true. 

But those people are still likely to buy a device like a MacBook. 


[deleted]


That's a good point.  If i'm taking pictures on a nice camera in the field, how would you go about getting them on your iPad?


No, that's the opposite of what we want.


I wish there was more Files support and adobe support also. I think if apple can push safari to its limits with a “desktop class” application, it’ll be a bit closer. 
We know iOS in a sense is limited on iPad but just opening it up that much more would be key. 

And who knows, with their 12.x releases, that could change the game also in terms of adding additional “pro” support. 


>	You can't even officially download a gameboy emulator

I’m pretty sure that’s copyright infringement which is why they’re not in the App Store

If you aren't invested in the Apple ecosystem, Android gives you half of that list.


This sounds like a Surface Book


I am strictly talking about the Pro model Apple is advertising as a PC replacement and professional device, not the cheaper model iPads. iOS is fine for the regular iPads, but is awful for any sort of professional work that Apple is trying to advertise to Pro to be for. 


What a ridiculous argument... Ford sells a lot more Explorers then GT 40s but that doesn't mean "the market has spoken" and they stop making the GT. 

It's insane to think that a company with the scale (and funding) of Apple can't make their "pro" devices actually work for professionals. 

Tech enthusiasts are the target market for a $2k tablet. Your wife and grandmother would be just fine with the $400 iPad. 


The 10.5” still dropped in price a bit on swappa and for resale since it isn’t the newer anymore. So that’s my plan I think. You can get a 256GB+unlocked iPad Pro 10.5 for less than the baseline new price now.


Why would they use an iPad instead of a MBP?


And you expect people to make a better buy because it’s the practical choice?


Any recommendations on software? Considering getting a iPad for this purpose and wondering what to use.


Which one? Link please?

Usually yearly is a version bump. WWDC (September) is usually when a major version is generally available. Beta testers start getting builds months in advance. 

iOS 13 also gets a lot of talk because Apple announced that a lot of the features of iOS 12 were getting pushed to iOS 13 because they weren’t happy with the quality of them come release time. So there’s two years of work of serious development that will be hitting come 13, and people are really hopeful and excited for what that might look like.

And I use the MacOS screen sharing app between Macs, I'd like to have it on iOS so I can screen share from my iPad to their Mac while I'm out and about. 🙏


That’s what I wanted to know.  MKBHD said something like: it’s powerful af but it’s still iOS. 


Agree and get downvoted. Neat. 


I hope not. That will be the end of the Macbook.


Someone already went there. Apple doesn't even need to do much work.

http://www.modbook.com/


They really need this because I'm now fully aware of now dope the iPad Pro is but in reality I should buy the Air given the way I use it (normal work i.e. excel and using a mouse). I was really hoping I would be able to use the iPad to replace my surface pro 4


I suggested this like a week ago and got downvoted into oblivion. Reddit is an interesting place 


macbook with touch screen?


That's totally fair given a surface book, but I can't see any reason to get an iPad over a surface pro, especially as I use it for note taking/Matlab work for classes. 


I have a first gen Surface Pro and am thinking the same. Since I have a work laptop the "laptop" portion of Windows isn't that necessary to me, and since I am using the Surface Pro for less work stuff, it's clunkiness as a tablet is more apparent.


No Apple laptop supports handwriting & drawing natively & [information that's handwritten is more likely to be retained than information typed](https://redbooth.com/blog/handwriting-and-memory). If a handful of work-arounds need to be implemented in order to support that, then I say "so be it."


The Execs at my company use them. They look pretty cool, but they're not the ones building anything, its strictly for easy communication (iMessage / email) and reviewing PDFs with their pencil (in illegible scribble). 

When they need to do real work they pull out their laptops. 


As a joke on the name "Apple", they should call it "Macintosh"!


And let me write code. I'd buy it yesterday if that was the case. 


That's all I need to make the switch. 


My thought is that Apple sincerely believes the iPad was supposed to be an entirely new "paradigm" of human/computer interaction: Using a touchscreen and a finger instead of a remote mouse and keyboard.


We're not *supposed* to be using or wanting a mouse to interact with an iPad.



In reality and practice, this paradigm falls flat as you still need to make more effort to move your entire hand or arm to interact with the touchscreen from a keyboard, virtual or physical.

Sure, the touchscreen interface made computing more accessible to the masses who aren't so technically-inclined (albeit in a limited manner)... But it simply doesn't match a normal mouse and keyboard.

That's something Microsoft acknowledges with its Surface line of actual computers made for pen input, along with compatibility for mouse/keyboard. And it seems to be selling way more of those vs. the iPad

Apple is still betting that if everyone sees a full version of Photoshop working on the iPad, that it will be taken more seriously than the Kindle as a work device. They're betting it will be easier to use than mouse/keyboard...

I love Apple for experimenting and innovating, but jeez, they seem to find it very difficult to admit when they are wrong, such as the headphone jack removal issue under the assumption that Bluetooth would be easier to use than a plug-and-play 3.5mm analog jack within the next 5 years starting in 2013.


Honestly, I doubt we'll ever get a cursor! Just seems very unlikely


I really don’t think a cursor is ever coming to the iPad. Apple will continue to push the MacBook Air as the laptop “light.” They’ve created a system that is 100% gesture control. Even the Apple Pencil isn’t really a compromise because they don’t have a UI that uses the pencil the way you’d use a mouse.


Exactly! These two are the *only* features that forced me to sell my iPad Pro 2nd gen in favor of a Windows tablet. I hated having to do it but work needs to get done when I'm on the go, and lack of mouse and full physical keyboard support on all apps just causes headaches...Lack of a locked landscape mode too, but I can live with that, at least. As soon as these features are implemented, I will get another one in a heartbeat.


What on earth does this mean? 


You mean like _every single year of iOS rumors vs. official announcements_?


Translation: Let the software self identify


> there're many rumors/indications that iOS 13 will make the iPad more capable -punkidow

Just this one


I'd like to start the rumor that iOS 13's biggest new feature will be dark mode.


Honestly, the day Xcode comes out for iPad Pro, I will buy one in a heartbeat. 

Hell, now the iPad Pro has USB-C and can charge an iPhone, I don't see why it can't do a data transfer.

The only reason I still have my MBP is for Xcode.


It would be nice to just toggle on/off "advanced" mode that enables these features. It'll easily satisfy both casual and power users.


So, given that all of those things are what macOS already does, how is it more pleasant than a Mac?  The screen is still fairly small (yes, using a 27" iMac here), and trying to hold your hand up and manipulate a device by touch is incredibly tiring.  Plus, if sitting on a desk (or in your lap), the angle you're looking at it at is going to give you a crick in the neck.  You could add on a trackpad/mouse, bluetooth keyboard, and elevate the screen to a reasonable level... you're basically using a Mac, anyway.


The more it encroaches into the capabilities of a MacBook, the more it leeches off potential sales. The two products have to coexist in the same ecosystem.


How would an iPad help with “confusing” MacBooks? The iPad Pro has less ports and a worse keyboard. It’s not going to gain extra ports, keyboard, and mouse/trackpad. That’s called a MacBook.


This iPad isn't really even any cheaper than a MacBook nowadays. If you are going to replace your computer with one, you'd want at a minimum the keyboard and 256GB of storage...that comes out to $1128! 


It doesn't have a real file browser and I don't expect it to ever get one.  The files app is extremely limited compared to the access I have on a "real" computer


But the limitations have only come to light because we’ve changed our expectations of the capabilities of this device. Ever since they added the ‘Pro’ moniker its been treated as a media creation tool, not a media consumption device. It also finds itself being compared to laptops now, which I think is what Apple wants.


It's insane to think that if you have large media that you want to edit in multiple apps, the same file has to be replaced each time. Or at least that was how it was last I used it before the "file browser" was introduced.  Is it fixed now?

The old way made it trivial to fill up storage fast.


It still doesn't really have a file browser (files app blows). Apple has this idea that people want their files to be spread around in apps. Their idea is that you won't need a convoluted file system. This is fine for mom of course, who might make a word document every once and awhile. For everyone else - it sucks. 


>  file browser

> a 'pro' or power user

I understand your point, but the idea that browsing files is a *power user* thing is insanity. 


I have a ton of family photos stored on an Ubuntu server and shared over SMB. It's very easy to access them and play an impromptu slideshow on any other device, but to this day I've not found a convenient way of doing this in iOS. No, copying them over to the device with FileExplorer or putting them in iCloud Photos doesn't count, especially as there's not enough storage space in either of those.

That's the problem with the iPad, it kind of can replace a laptop, but you encounter so many corner cases like this where it's awkward to do a task that it's easier to just give up and pick up a "real" computer. That A12X is wasted on iOS.


Even the file browser is still crippled. Half of the time I save something to Files, it disappears into the ether...


This part of the article really stuck out for me:

>	I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.

I’ve been using iPads for years and I got so used to routines I created so I could get files off and on my iPad. Being able to “send to” before made me use my OneDrive to upload and download files. Then when Files app was introduced that helped a little bit but the easiest way I transferred files between my laptop and desktop was a USB drive. 




Probably cause Macs have always been for that niche. Even if the iPad Pro has "Pro" in the name, it's still first and foremost marketed as a tablet first with "Pro" experiences.


Very true, but the addition of ‘Pro’ naming also probably raised the expected functionality of this device.


> It's not striking at all

Wow, really? I can't be the only one around here who things it's **quite striking**.


I hate the fact that adobe is so dominant for RAW processing. I wasn’t around for Aperture and what that was like but I really wish Lightroom had more competition. It’s basically just Capture One at this point and they’re still really unknown. 


> We should see more changes with iOS 13

iOS 13 is supposedly getting a total SpringBoard update that was supposed to be coming with iOS 12, so I'm really hoping for a dark mode since Mojave just got one. Hopefully there's a little more for the prosumer in there as well, IMHO the new iPad Pro is fantastic but iOS is just NOT a desktop-replacement OS in its current form and won't be without big improvements. 



It deletes half your files... but that allows it to run faster. 


The keyboard is already snap-on, right?


That would be Marvelous.


As all things should be.


Just like every other Apple product, you’ll have to give up something you love to get it.


But you half of your data are lost.


The 9.7" model only has 2gb of ram. Safari and reddit burn through that really quickly and pretty much all apps reload instead of resuming.

I use my iPad primarily as a companion device during the day running chat apps, calendar, and media control or as an additional monitor with Spacedesk (much better than Duet).

At night I use it for casual browsing, gaming, and reddit.

It performs okay, just a few hangups with Narhawl reddit client on video intensive subreddits and the constant battle for ram.


> Apple, for whatever reason, is holding back on the software.

The reasons are pretty obvious. They're struggling to find the right balance between adding desktop-like features and retaining iOS's security.


Additionally, I sense that Apple's hardware team is firing on all cylinders while their software teams have lost some of their competitive edge.



it's been able to read off more than that long before, did they remove the functionality?

https://youtu.be/SqX_oPMAgvc?t=124

EDIT: i read the article, it's the same as it was before and nothing has changed

> Apple says third parties can write apps to talk to external storage, but out of the box, this $1899 tablet simply won’t talk to a flash drive.


Technically Photos allows you to edit in external applications and save non-destructive edits. Snapseed does this correctly.

Adobe doesn’t because Adobe sells its own cloud syncing. Why would they support iCloud for any reason? 


[deleted]


It does HDR. Not 4K though I don’t think. 


Well I think it’s because most content is 1080p then 4K.  So to take advantage of the display you really need content that’s higher than 1440p, which would usually be 4K. 


I'd say the external storage is the worst, the importing photos workflow is annoying, but there are workarounds. Adding proper USB support wouldn't be that hard, and it would be really useful.


Ugh you’re right I forgot about MFi


Meanwhile on Surface (or any other Win10 device FWIW) it's literally plug and play.

Seriously.. I would buy it right now if it had usb c


Look at the 3rd gen ThinkPad X1 Tablet


I agree its completely stupid. I bought mine when the Go was about to come out so the USB-C port got me to preorder it, but I ended up going with the SP2017 for LTE and I have to use usb keys. 


That's basically the entire story of the iPad. It was easier to cut them slack eight years ago. Since then it seems like iOS development has ground to a snail's pace, and even then the iPad always plays second fiddle to the iPhone. It's nowhere close to being a laptop replacement and at this pace I honestly don't see it ever getting there. 


People really forgot that the original iPad didn't support multitasking, printing, or Adobe Flash (remember when a lack of Flash support used to be a big deal?)


LumaFusion for video, Lightroom CC for photos, though I really should just bite the bullet and buy Affinity Photo

When I watched the event I was thinking how if the new iPad just had cursor support I could do everything on one device. Then I remembered the pixel slate coming out soon, and while the hardware and performance probably won't be on par with iPad, the capabilities of it wildly outperform any iOS device. I think I'll just keep my Pixelbook for now. 

I also think it's unlikely that apple will make iPad truly competitive with laptops because then it becomes just as if not even more capable than many of their more expensive Macs. 


Apple seems unwilling to combine the peanut butter with the jelly. They’d rather you buy two half ads products and hook you on iServices.  I don’t care how fast the A12x is if the OS is Tinker Toy then it’s wasted power.


I agree, and I don’t even see how it’s a debate here. Bottom line, iOS can’t do many of the major things one would buy a laptop for. And the things it can do, it’s usually just a worse version of it (i.e. Microsoft word). Just because the specs are great and the benchmarks are crazy doesn’t mean it can replace a machine that has a physical mouse/cursor/trackpad and a completely different OS. If you want to browse reddit/watch YouTube, you’re not looking for a laptop replacement. All the iPads in the last 8 years have been perfect for that. 


This summed it up excellently:
>either you have to understand the limitations of iOS so well you can make use of these little hacks all over the place to get things done, or you just deal with it and accept that you have to go back to a real computer from time to time because it’s just easier. And in that case, you might as well just use a real computer. I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.


People who say their iPads have completely replaced their laptops almost always have some awkward series of workarounds and concessions for basic tasks.


Which is why the $329 iPad + a $99 Apple Pencil is still a better buy for most people who want an iPad experience. It is insane to me that Apple is releasing some of the best chips with some of the most limited software.


The reviewer puts that nicely. A computer has to adapt to my workflow, I shouldn't have to adapt my workflow for the computer.

Sure it's possible, but not easy or convinient. I want to use an ipad as my main mobile computer, but I can't because it's OS is too limited no matter how much I love the apps and hardware.


It doesn't even do Facebook well or Instagram at all. The iPad can only replace your laptop if you're an Apple fan desperate to make that happen


You shouldn't over-emphasize the price here, it starts at $800, putting it under most if not all at this point of the devices sold by Apple running MacOS. If you don't need MacOS, it makes sense to the average consumer. Note I'm not one of those people, but I can see the audience who will buy this device easily.


I still see it as an aspirational computing target - Apple thinks we’ll get there eventually, so they’re putting work into it. 

I think it’s more likely to work here than in somewhere like education (where the reality is that most schools don’t have the budget for Apple’s aspirational model for how devices should be used in education). 

As for the growing up part, there’s enough of an audience for future applications or platforms to target tablets, and so people will make them. 

There’ll always be a place for workstation-class hardware for certain jobs, but the mobility and simplicity the iPad provides will be really valuable to every other job. I’m sure that there used to be days where nobody even considered compiling software on a laptop because it was just too slow, but now it’s doable (and beefy desktops still exist for everything else).

I use an iPad Pro.. for logic remote and do the actual work on my Mac Pro, because Logic Remote is “GarageBand with different icon.” 


I’m an it pro that almost exclusively uses my iPad Pro. 

Pro is just a name. It means more featured than standard.  

It’s just a model name. You don’t have to be any one of those things to use it.  


I believe the only real solution is for Apple to allow advanced users to unlock their devices, so that third party developers can do what they want with the apps and system, just like they can on macOS. iOS is mature enough. The hardware is absolutely mature enough. The Jailbreak community has proved there's a community out there that can take iOS to the next level. You can install stuff on a mac that will mess up the system, sure. But having the freedom to do so should be your right. Just inform the user that they'll be unlocking their device at their own peril.


Future proofing?

I mean the new pro's are too much for me to pay but I bought last years Ipad Pro 10.5 knowing it will last me years for what I use it for rather than having to buy a new Ipad every year or two.


Do you get new earphones in the box with a USB C port?


Yeah but since I use Logic on the Mac it would be great to have a seamless experience without having to bounce tracks and all that. I can imagine a scenario where I'm recording remotely with the band, then I come home and AirDrop my project onto my MBP and continue work seamlessly. 


iPad alongside lightroom handles raw images quite well in my opinion. You need a lighting to SD card reader to transfer files from a camera to the iPad. Still a bit annoying that I have to import images into camera roll before I can import them into lightroom to edit. Lightroom for iPad is quite good overall. 


Then what do YOU want. 


Emulators themselves aren’t copyright infringement. The issue is ROMS and BIOS files used with emulators. 


To the best of my knowledge, a complicated calculator. Why do you ask?


yeah I’m invested into the ecosystem. I already have a MBP so I’m not in need of an iPad Pro... more of a “it’d be nice to have” type things.

I’m definitely not a fan of Android though, especially with tablets (as if there are any left that are competitive with iPad). I’d much rather go for a Google Slate (technically ChromeOS) or a Surface Pro.

They'd use both. The use case for artists should be obvious. For people in academia, you can use the iPad for making presentations, typing up notes, making annotations on papers you're reading/reviewing, general reading etc. That's anywhere from 30-70% of your computer use depending on your subject and specialty.


Procreate is what I use more than anything else right now. You can see a bunch of work I've made with it [over on my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nicetriangles/) if you're curious about what can be done with it.

Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer are also great and I hear good things about Clip Studio Paint but haven't tried it. An iPad version of Photoshop was announced for 2019 too!

I bought one of [these Luna Display dongles](https://lunadisplay.com/) too and it allows me to use the iPad like a wireless Wacom Cintiq when paired with my MacBook Pro. It's a little pricey but it's really impressive how well it works. It's good enough that I'm trying to sell my Cintiq.


It’s this review. The article has a video review as well

I think MacBook has a place. Microsoft has the surface book for a reason. The surface is more tablet than laptop, vs the surface book being more laptop than tablet. 

They may have to also redesign the MacBook to accommodate that. 


[deleted]


Well it’s either that or watch the iPad fade into irrelevance with the high end market. It’s embarrassing how inadequate iOS is for the iPad Pro. 


Yeah I think that’s the major concern that Apple faces. Do they really want to risk iOS cannibalise MacBook...


Their attitude really should be that they should produce the device that the market demands and that they shouldn’t go against the trajectory towards which technology is advancing. Look at the iPod. They killed it off when it became irrelevant due to the advances of the iPhone. Would they really be better off if they held back on reinventing the mobile phone just to save the iPod? The same can be said of MacBooks and iPads.

In any case, they can always just beef up the specs of a MacBook Pro, make it into a gaming machine, or merge it and the iPad into a new form factor, whatever. Apple has the data to determine what its users will buy—they would know better than us on how to differentiate. In the end, their products cannibalizing each other is hardly a problem—the money still goes into their pockets.


Yeah I had a Surface Pro before I got my Surface Book and it worked brilliantly right up until it’s hard drive spontaneously failed on me. It’s probably the only true laptop/tablet hybrid 


But can’t the 329 iPad do handwriting?


The MACIPAD! 


I need a damn terminal, *and root*.


> they seem to find it very difficult to admit when they are wrong

Yeah, and they've been wrong a lot lately. The Traschcan Pro was obviously wrong from the outset. The 2014 Mini was wrong. The Macbook is wrong. The 2016+ MBP is wrong. The new MBA is wrong. The iMac, ever since it was glued shut and soldered RAM, is wrong. The iMac Pro is interesting, but wrong for most people.

The iPad is for browsing Reddit on the couch.

I think I'm done. I don't even know what they're doing these days. I don't know anyone who is happy with their products, and almost everyone I know is a Mac user now, having switched about 10 years ago. It feels like the 90s all over again, with increasingly baffling choices coming out of Cupertino with increasingly batshit prices attached.


Bluetooth is definitely and easier to use than 3.5mm. It is also way more expensive. It was admissible when they removed cd drives from their laptops because by then people were already using less and less cds. Totally not the case with 3.5mm. 


Translation: don't get your hopes up.


[deleted]


The thing is you can totally do a data transfer, even going back to the original iPad via adapters. They way I see it you could have your iPhone/iPad combo for XCode and plug your iPhone in for testing. 


Its still going to need:

1. Mouse/cursor support

2. Proper Video Out/Multi Monitor support

3. A "dock" of some sort to provide the ports and functionality that a laptop/desktop has.

4. Support for "desktop" applications. It at least needs applications on par with other desktop applications that I use regularly: Multiple IDEs, Photoshop(I do hear this is coming so one down), Blender/Max/Maya/Fusion360, full FinalCutPro/Motion, more powerful DAW(Auria is really good for mobile but still not up to par. Theres decent ones but really I think limited RAM is the problem here), VirtualBox or some kind of VM or Docker support. With this will also come the need for more local storage, 256g minimum.

5. More RAM!!! LOTS OF MORE RAM!!! Doing the things I do is not happening on 6 gigs, not even on a laptop. 8gigs minimum/16 preferred and ideally 32+.

6. Better multitasking.

Without those things its dead to me for development. I am not working on some tiny ass single monitor with me having to reach up every time I need to move the cursor while editing. It might work in a pinch but as a go to machine it would hurt productivity and cost me money to use.

Edit: jayfehr made some promises but failed to deliver. Seems jayfehr thought that output to one monitor was the same as multi monitor support. If anyone knows of a multi monitor solution I'd love to see how it works as I just cant imagine how it would. Also interested, does iOS support ethernet? I would think so if you had the adapters and dongles right - but is there somewhere in settings to configure it? on my iPad theres only a Wifi settings so if you plug in ethernet does another option show up in settings for it??? Edit edit: [seems you can](https://jacobsalmela.com/2016/04/09/use-wired-ethernet-on-your-ipad-or-iphone/), but how do you configure it if you have to(does it use the Wifi settings tab)?


I don't hold my hand up. I use the apple pencil for virtually all the UI. And I generally raise it up higher than the keyboard to give it a good viewing angle. (I used a bluetooth keyboard)

But, the advantages:

* It's a 120hz display. It's wonderful to look at and use
* When needed I can take it down from the mount and draw on it. For part of my work I need to make drawings. It feels nicer than a wacom. 
* It runs the same apps as my phone. So, any Shortcut I've made in the shortcuts app uses both, and I use these a fair bit. Likewise, any apps I use work on both devices. Marzipan may change this to some extent, extending ios apps to the mac. But for now his lets me easily continue some work when away from my ipad. 
* It's very simple to pickup the ipad and go somewhere with it, and it's also more comfortable to use on the couch
* I like to reduce light exposure at night. I find "reduce white point" more effective than flux, and it's easy to turn on and off. You can technically do this on a mac but it's a chore + flashes white whenever you edit the settings
* No fans. I really dislike fan noise and love that the ipad is totally silent

The integrated apps is the biggest thing. I've been able to build systems that run across the whole of my computing experience. It also means I can leave my phone behind and still access most stuff with my watch or ipad. I find the phone more distracting because that's where the social media apps are, the ipad is still locked down. 

Hope that gives an idea of why I like using it, *despite* the fact that macos is way better at a bunch of stuff. I do still use a mac as well, but for specific use cases rather than general uses. 


Apple has never been shy about competing with their own products. The iphone competed the ipod out of existense. And they've said explictly they don't fear obsoleting stuff, because otherwise someone else will.

Actually, the current Files app goes a long way towards real file management—except for the fact that on iOS, data is still sandboxed with apps, and there's no efficient or intuitive way to copy large files to/from external devices.

&#x200B;


[deleted]


>But the limitations have only come to light because we’ve changed our expectations of the capabilities of this device.

They've mainly come to light because of Apple's insistence on marketing the iPad as a PC replacement. They have a bit of a conundrum—how to beef up iOS without sacrificing the simplicity and security that have made it so successful.


Their own advertising is doing that. Remember the “what’s a computer” ad?


As an audio engineer it’s laughable when I see “Pro” on the new MacBooks. I have a 2014 and that shit is pro, because I can hook everything I need into it. 




>It also finds itself being compared to laptops now, which I think is what Apple wants.

Except Apple pushed this narrative far too quickly and a lot of people tried using an iPad Pro for work (including my fiancee). I know several companies that bought a lot of iPads and ended up selling them because of how awful the "pro" experience was.

Now those people and companies will be far less likely to return to this ecosystem for their pro needs. Apple has absolutely failed to capture the business market here and they will need a complete overhaul to make any progress in the future.


It is possible to to work “in-place” across apps now, and has been since iOS 9 or 10 (I’m thinking 9), even before Files was a thing. However, then and now, it requires the apps to properly support “Open in” rather than “Copy to” and, then and now, app support for it is spotty. It’s frustrating.


Not the op.

But I guess the idea was that a power user would most probably need/want to manage their files themselves. That may not always be the case with a regular, less tech-savy user. There’s that...


Well that expectation should have been tempered with the first two generations.

I'm actually surprised people are placing a lot of hope on iOS 13, it's not like people just realized the software limitations today.


Pro is just a model name.

What do you think it means?


Aperture and Lightroom actually served two separate roles: image editing and image cataloging/organization. 

For editing, Lightroom was arguably well ahead of Aperture years before the latter was discontinued. Aperture's editing controls were still good, and their user interfaces were infinitely nicer than Adobe's, but if you closely examined the output, LR often delivered somewhat better results.

For cataloging—the term is actually DAM: digital asset management—Aperture was and remains vastly superior to Lightroom or any other competing product on the market.


Has this actually been confirmed? Everyone is taking about iOS 13 like it is confirmed where they are changing everything.


it only comes with half an SSD so you'll be fine


marvelOS

Adobe controls the creative market. There is no viable alternative to Lightroom. 


HEVC isn’t Apple’s. Google developed VP9 (earlier VP8) as an alternative to H.264 back in the day. HEVC came later but google already had VP9 by then. Both H.264 and HEVC require licensing costs, which google would have to pay out of its ass for running a massive service like YouTube. Apple would meanwhile have to build in a VP9 decoder on its hardware but Apple is extremely pig headed to the point where it doesn’t even use the VP9 decoding ability built into Intel chips on Macs. 


Damn. Was hoping for oled iPad. Too much to ask. 


What does support 4K HDR video on it then? All the apps are doing 1080p HDR, including Apples own iTunes video so outside of the videos shot on the camera or those transferred manually over iTunes, what exactly does play in 4K on it? 


What’s resolution do Netflix provide when watching on iPad ? 1080 ?


“Pro”


Same! TB3 would be an instant buy on my end


Don't know how I haven't came across this! Only 3 models is a huge let down, I want the i7 model but do not want to pay for a 1tb SSD as well.


I expected Apple to take some tips from ChromeOS for the iPad version of iOS. 

After ChromeOS got the Play Store integration, it's like you combine the best of Android, and plop it into an OS that has near-desktop capabilities. Something like that would benefit the iPad greatly but I'm not sure if Apple wants to go that far with the iPad despite their marketing.

It's a shame too cause tablet wise, nothing on the ChromeOS or Android side comes close to the iPad in terms of hardware. I'd mention the Surface but I've been there and done that, and full Windows 10 on a tablet just becomes cumbersome. I truly believe Google has the best solution here for an OS on a tablet, but their hardware has more work to be done.

If you're comparing to devices running MacOS, you need to price in the keyboard. So around $1000.


For the average consumer, they still sell the $320 iPad.

And $800 gets you an unusable 64GB of storage and no keyboard. For any kind of semi-serious work, you’ll need a keyboard and more storage. 


Agreed - we're in a gross transitional phase and I've been dying for the future when my glass slate can do what my Macbook Pro can, but I can't help but feel like Apple shot themselves in the foot when it comes to software. 

The hardware was ready when they launched the original 9.7" iPad Pro - I don't know what's going on there but it seems like we've been waiting on iOS to catch up to what macOS can do (something I don't understand given how little resources they seem to devote to macOS in general). In the meantime we've been sold this idea that the iPads are capable of a lot more than they are. I think Stephen Hackett said it best - the new iPads are like super cars. Tons of power that just can't be harnessed properly, and I think the OS is a big reason for it. I hope iOS 13 is a doozie for the iPad.


College students with the newest Macbook and don't even know what type c is... "OH no I sorry I have the new charger not the old one". Jimmy for fucks sake did you even bother to look at reviews or you just  thought oh it's apple so it's the best device money can buy 


Nah rich suburban soccer moms. I don't think there's a single mom in my extended family that doesn't have a high-end iPad. And all they use it for is Facebook and Candy Crush. But for some reason they all have the latest and greatest.


this goes against apple design philosophy of  controlling the entire user experience as much as possible 


You don’t. 


Aren’t those required files in order to play anything?


The iPad doesn't have a calculator.
Ergo it's not a computer.
Checkmate!


My friend had a Surface Book and the base was as solid as any other laptop keyboard I've used.  The Surface Book and the Surface Pro are two different products so I think you're thinking of the Surface Pro.


What u/limewirelord said, the Surface book has a solid base and more expensive models even have a discrete GPU in the base along with extra battery and a keyboard.


The Surface Book and the Surface Pro are very different devices.  You're describing the Surface Pro, which is a tablet with an optional flimsy keyboard.  The Surface Book is a laptop with a detachable screen.


I'm one of those people that almost never uses my iPad. I find I am more comfortable typing on my MBP 2015 keyboard. Generally if I'm making annotations I have something printed out or it is a physical book. Even my professors did it this way when I was still in school.


I was drunk sorry ha


Forget about the surface book, Microsoft has the Surface Laptop *2* for a reason.

To me, if you take a look at the last gen MacBook Air - and asked what would an upgraded version of this be?

* A modern, high resolution/contrast/brightness display with less bezel

* A CPU worthy of the upgrade and in the same 15W category

* A keyboard/touchpad that is a joy to use

* A thin / light machine

* Long battery life

* SAME AFFORDABLE STARTING PRICE!

I think that's a fairly complete list.

If you look at that list, the new MacBook Air checks a lot of the boxes, but the Surface Laptop 2 checks them all.

At the same weight, width, thickness and a similar design.. it even manages to keep *magsafe* onboard.




> they can always just beef up the specs of a MacBook Pro

Yeah right! :-D As if that beast isn't expensive enough. 

My big wish is that they go the other way, go back to a thicker laptop with more normal components that you can swap, like the 2012 Macbook Pro. Having the thinnest and lightest laptop is - for me - totally irrelevant. I would like to be able to put in a normal 1TB SSD for $200 instead of $2000, have a better keyboard, bigger battery, more USB ports (A and C). 

It's totally OK that they make the thinnest devices for exorbitant prices, but I hope they come to their senses and start to make devices that are "affordable" around $1000. 


They sold them with hard drives?


Are you suggesting to get that iPad *and* a laptop? Then the bill gets higher & you carry more. Or if you're saying that that iPad could replace the computer, a 9.7" inch screen replaces the laptop & you saved close to $1K


Pretty sure that joke "Mac X iPad" or Maxipad is coming back.


The amount of money Apple makes off of programmers specifically has to be a tiny drop in the bucket for them.


Have you not seen the iPad Pro prices?
They’re well into MacBook territory once you ignore the useless 64gb models

What's a computer?


lol i’d eat my underwear if that happens  


It’s not a file management app. If you can’t access a local hardware storage box. It’s not file managing.


>example the file thing. Some App won't share with another app properly so you have to install a third app to share it to as the go between the first two apps.

I also find this immensely frustrating, but I can see Apple's perspective on this. Today, it's difficult to compromise an iOS device by merely plugging in an accessory. If you eliminate sandboxing and allow free-for-all file access you will negatively impact security.


While I largely agree with you, the Apple design philosophy is to avoid workarounds. If apps can’t share directly and smoothly, fix that rather than implementing a file browser.

Clearly, they *didn’t* actually solve that for one reason or another, and we need a file browser. Just saying that I understand why it took so long to appear: they really wanted to get a better, more modern solution. It just didn’t happen.

This. 
It is extremely frustrating that Open in Place is so underutilized. Does anyone know why? Apple provides the extensions...


Not officially, but heavily rumored I guess? The SpringBoard update was supposed to happen in iOS 12 and it got pushed back, so people are rightfully(?) assuming that it's on the list for 13 now. 


I was thinking the same as you...but I have the 10.5” and it has never been a problem. Half the ram makes sense


Exactly, they have no reason to support iCloud when they have you hooked on CC.


I would kind of rather have an iPad that last seven or eight years without the screen needing to be replaced. Although the black black would be nice.


Exactly. It can playback 4K imported videos. I think apps don’t do 4K because the device isn’t 4K itself.  Apple should have an options for max quality of the iPad which is just a little more than 1440p. 


At least on the Canadian Lenovo website you can customize it. Some things require certain other components (i.e. 16GB RAM requires the i7) but you can certainly buy it with 16GB, i7, and 256GB SSD. https://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/tablets/windows-tablets/thinkpad-tablet-series/ThinkPad-X1-Tablet-3rd-Gen/p/20KJCTO1WWENCA0/customize

One thing to note also, the SSDs in these are user replaceable NVMe M.2. So if you don't care about NVMe speeds (like me), you should be able to buy one with the base model storage and then buy a (much, much cheaper) SATA M.2 drive to put in there. I paid $180CAD for 1TB M.2 SATA the other day, compared to ~$600 for an NVMe drive, and I don't do anything that takes advantage of the ludicrous storage speed, so it's a no brainer. That way you could get a 1TB SSD for the same price as the 512GB upgrade.

I don't have one of these but I'm seriously considering it. Just not sure if I should pull the trigger or wait till earlier next year as I'm not in a rush.


>Agreed - we're in a gross transitional phase and I've been dying for the future when my glass slate can do what my Macbook Pro can, but I can't help but feel like Apple shot themselves in the foot when it comes to software.

It can do it. All the power is there. **Apple has chosen to prevent it from doing so**.

Apple has built an incredibly powerful machine that is essentially a MBP in iPad form factor. But, they refuse to give it the software to actually do MBP stuff. I'm sure they could slap macOS on there in a week, but they just wont't do it.

> I think Stephen Hackett said it best - the new iPads are like super cars. Tons of power that just can't be harnessed properly,

Eh, supercars can definitely harness their power properly. Their power is not for normal commuting, but everyone understand that. Also, you buy supercars primarily for the aesthetics.


Boo, had planned on using my current stock earphones from my iphone 7+ with the ipad but since its changed port and don't give you any backwards compatibility I guess I'd need to get new earphones to use it in a public place.


Depends on how the emulator was created. Some emulators completely emulated the BIOS file, so you don’t need to download a copy. 

As for games, you can play user created ROMs. So yes there are legal uses for the video game emulators, but 99.999% of people want to use it to play commercial games, which is a copyright infringement. 


It's the device that advertisement was edited on.


It **is** a file management app—but one designed primarily for use with cloud storage services. So your main complaint should be that you want direct access to local files and connected storage, rather than just vilifying the app as a whole.

My only complaints with the File app's design are that it doesn't sort folders separately from files, and that it doesn't allow you to sort files by type.



I don’t have a solution, but a workaround: Get **Local Storage** app on your device. Then the Files app gets a step closer to being a real browser.


It's a necessity. Sure, arbitrary file access and even code execution can be a security risk, but it's also needed for many workflows. If it's acceptable on the Mac, it should be on the iPad. 


I understand that file browsers are inefficient for the average user, but for media creation, they're actually a very efficient workflow. For various forms of media creation, it makes sense to be able to categorically and sub-categorically, organize your media elements, data, and project files. You will quite often be working with the same elements across multiple applications, and/or may need to make clear distinctions between versions of various projects or elements (which is helped immensely by storing those files in separate locations). You may also be working with files on a "grouped" basis, or even be working off of the same files over multiple devices via a server. The very nature of many media creation projects calls for a solution based on files/data/elements being organized and accessed independently of apps. Yet, iOS has been designed in exactly the opposite capacity.

Admittedly, I see the argument for ditching the file system for the average user. The average user probably has minimal use for a file system that soft workarounds couldn't supplant. However, working without a real file system as a media professional would require a totally revolutionary approach to managing cross-application elements, data organization, and project/media sharing.

If Apple wants iOS to cater to these professionals, but they don't want iOS to have a real file system, then they need to come up with a proper, alternative solution. I don't see any evidence to indicate that they are, or they will anytime soon, and with the bulk of professional media work still happening on desktops, I don't see professional media software revolutionizing their own UX to not rely on the file system. Thus, it makes the most sense for Apple to just give us  a real, capable file system in iOS.


My response was in reference to the comment I replied to. 


They don't have **me** hooked on anything since I refuse to use any Adobe products, for a wide variety of reasons.


You don’t have to replace and OLED screen. 


I’m in the same boat, not a huge lenovo fan. I’m looking for a thin device with an i7, 16GB of ram, and TB3. I have an external GPU enclosure i want to take advantage of!


> When you are a professional user you might rely on Outlook. Or if you are photographer you might want fast access to a camera app that supports RAW, like Halide or import photos directly into a different app and not be forced to use Apple photos etc.

Boy when Nilay showed that Camera Import and said Apple's response was to use a Siri Shortcut...HARD PASS. The sad thing is that any update that would bring us up to something more pro-level is going to be first launched in beta at WWDC and not officially released for a year. 

What on earth is the justification for buying this kind of hardware now in lieu of just springing for a Mac if that's your day-to-day? 

>There is no good argument, especially for a professional tool, not to have default apps. It doesn't impact a normal user in any way if it is simply a setting in the settings app.

So true.


That’s unfortunate. I wish Apple would have transitioned to USB Type-C on all their devices, so less people would have issues like yours.


I hear you, and I agree that the balance needs to be tipped more towards expanding functionality. But Apple has no interest in bringing back all of the negative aspects of the PC/Mac environment which they so successfully muted with iOS.

You don’t have to replace a battery for getting crappy either. But some people are pretty strict about burn in. 


Waiting for the current phone contract to run out December before I decide whether to upgrade or just run my current phone into the dust then upgrade at that point.

Not sure about the new ipad pro yet since I'll need a load more new accessories to support the amount of travel I do. 

Think I'll wait for the iphones to get USBC before I upgrade.


What negative aspects? MacOS is Apple's best product.


Messy desktops and chaotic folder structures in the user-accessed part of the file structure say otherwise. How much content is, say, uploaded to FAcebook via mobile vs. via a computer where you have to search first where the file is?


Can only wish the iPhones would get USB Type-C soon, but I don’t have my hopes up


I love macOS, but it’s an old OS with a lot of baggage. There’s a small and shrinking pool of developers who can write Mac apps, and the Mac is not a growth platform for Apple. Also, as secure as macOS is, it still isn’t as secure as iOS. 

And for new (read: young) users, a lot of the features you and I value aren’t even on the radar. Those younger users seem more comfortable with iOS than with macOS. 





Aye, just means I will need to buy a lightning to USBC cable. I find it weird they don't include any earphones in the box for the ipad. If you're paying close to a £1250+ for the pencil, keyboard and ipad you'd think they could throw in some of the basic earphones.


Final Cut Pro requires the M1, while Logic Pro requires the A12


Huh, figured they’d announce pro apps like this at WWDC, if at all


So, apparently Logic should work with the 6th gen iPad mini.

That makes it the best ultra portable studio you could ever get. I love it.

Subscription model… $4.99 per month or $49 per year


[deleted]


If you listen closely you can hear every Apple youtuber cheering right now.


The mad lads have done it. Wow!

WWDC must be packed to the rim if they are dropping Final Cut Pro and Logic for iPad in a single press release.


Been a loooong time coming.


I wonder if this will stretch to macOS for the subscription based pricing


there's the excuse for recording video on ipad


>	Beginning Tuesday, May 23, Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad will be available on the App Store as subscriptions.

It seems the monkey’s paw has curled 🤮🤮🤮
4.99 a month or 49 a year isn’t terrible for someone that will make use of it — but a little disappointed in the subscription based model


Tbh I don’t think the monthly subscription is a bad thing for iPadOS. Imagine the people who would use iPads for Final Cut editing; students? People just getting into media? People who need it for one project and never again? People who are just curious about the software?

Having the low barrier to entry on a tablet version of the software serves a good purpose for those types of users. It doesn’t automatically turn them off with a multiple hundred dollar price tag and if they love it/become more advanced/need it, the macOS versions are there.


Now an M1 or M2 iPad Pro starts to make sense


Aperture user here: still salty


Im crying 😭 been waiting so long. GarageBand is great for a quick idea to build on, but being able to take it a little further away from the mac is game changing.


My only question. How many audio In and Out can the app do? 32x32? Take my money instantly. As a live sound engineer that would be incredible.


I guess I’ll never get Aperture back…


BUT WHAT WILL WE COMPLAIN ABOUT NOW!?!?


Already paid $200 for MacOS version of Logic.  

It would be great to be able to seamlessly use all the great Audiokit iOS apps as plug-ins on an iPad, but I’m not paying for yet another subscription.


This I suspect is a move towards AR being instantly useful.


With subscription. Fucking lame.


*What will we complain about now? *
Subscription models. That’s what we will complain about. I’m guessing if you can’t afford a Mac & FCP all up front then Apple is making it easier in terms of price so you to get an iPad and a subscription based version of Logic & FCP?

Cool but I hate the subscription world we currently live in.


Holy shit they actually did it.

Blarg subscription.


I mean that’s fabulous and I’ll get it immediately but like… I’ve already dropped $300 on FCP. Can’t I just like… not pay subscription


I commented on a WWDC rumor thread some time back that this is the announcement I'd been hoping to see at the conference.  I'm pleasantly surprised to see it finally made official but at the same time kinda bummed about the subscription model.  That has me concerned about the future of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro on macOS, particularly the elimination of perpetual, versioned licensing.  I'm hoping the likes of FL Studio, Resolve and Ableton Live keeps that in check.  Worse case scenario I'll just be inclined to switch to those all Final Cut and Logic go pure subscription.


> Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad will be available on the App Store as subscriptions starting Tuesday, May 23.

Apple is getting in on this subscription nonsense too now?


> Starting Tuesday, May 23, Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad will each be available on the App Store for $4.99 (US) per month or $49 (US) per year with a one-month free trial.

This makes me slightly concerned for the future of Logic Pro on macOS.


“Available as subscriptions” 

C’mon man, I already spent $200 for Logic Pro! Let me have it on iPad Pro :(


Any time I see “subscription” I just look for alternatives that charge one time price or are (open source) *free*, and I can usually find them. I do not support the subscription model


[deleted]


It’s a subscription service, I already own both of them on Mac but still need to pay extra fee for iPad version.


[deleted]


Good morning! We have some incredible subscriptions to show you today! 

Our teams have been hard at work trying to figure out the best way to grab more cash from you. And in the end we said, fuck it, they’re gonna love it!


Interesting, when is apple gonna do some big updates to Final Cut? Feel like it’s been so long since they’ve done some really good stuff on it


Despite being a subscription, it’s still cheaper then on Mac at least.


Good stuffs but dumb pricing decision.

Apple should also provide one-off purchase option.


It’s cool and all, but why is it subscription-based?

Iirc, it’s a one-time purchase for Mac computers, so why is this different?


Awesome let’s wish for Xcode at WWDC 😊


How has Apple not made an advanced podcasting app yet ala iMovie?  It seems like a no-brainer to create something that records, enhances the audio, and publishes directly to their platform.


[deleted]


As someone that uses FCPX extensively, I can't imagine using this as my main workflow but I'm happy this happened. I was shocked that Resolve came to iPad before FCPX. I use too many tools, plugins, etc for me to be the target demographic but this should make LumaFusion fans happy. 

The only thing that sucks is the monthly subscription for it. I know $4.99 a month isn't alot, I just hate subscriptions. Almost wish it was just a flat $200 one time fee. I actually look forward to watching workflows and how people use this. I consider this a win.


aaaaand there goes any hopes of macOS on iPad!


damn, poor lumafusion


I’m starting to lose hope that there will be a port of Aperture for the iPad.


They should include this with Apple premier subscription.


Woulda paid a good sum up front for life long use. Totally out on a subscription based FC.


Oh no subscriptions, cringe


[deleted]


Just got a new midi keyboard too! Can’t wait to use it with my 2020 iPad now


subscription model? no thanks bro


Wow! This is amazing! This will change *nothing* for me!


That's rough... I already own the software on Mac, why should I pay for it twice? It's the best thing about Apple's creative programs, I can have them downloaded on any device that is connected to my Apple ID...

I guess it's a really smart move for them because this lowers the barrier of entry basically making FCPX and Logic a sort of gateway drug... can you imagine how many people with, let's say, an M1 iPad Air are going to try this for editing their TikToks? After that the next step is either upgrading to an iPad Pro or jumping to the MacBook, where you're going to pay $200/300 extra for the Mac version of the program you already know. Why would you switch?

Apple is smart, and knows it ;)


It’s a subscription model so fuk this.


Ugh, subscription. Come on Apple, you're better than this


Don’t want another damn subscription!


Subscription model sucks.


The fuck was the point of me buying an iPad in 2020. I have the model before the M1 and it’s like all of those pre-M1 models just got completely left behind. What a waste of fucking money.


Neat.


I wonder if there‘s gonna be more announcement before wwdc to leave room for other announcements


Wow. Picked a good day to trade my M1 MBA in for a 13 inch M2 iPad.

This is not an announcement I expected to hear at all.


Please let me keep my Mac Logic without subscription in the future. Otherwise very cool. But this will probably normalize subscription models for everything. “You’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy”


I don't really get it, why wouldn't you do any serious music production on a Mac instead of an iPad? It's nearly as portable.


Does this mean my third partly plug ins will work with the iPad - how transferable is Logic Pro from MacBook to iPad?


MainStage now


Finally!


THE HAPPENING!!

Never thought I’d see the day…


Can’t believe I spent almost $1000 on my 2020 Pro to not be able to use this stuff.


I loathe subscription models, but I've also always wanted to try an iMac/iPad setup...pissy about the sub but I'll consider it. (specially depending on what's offered at next months event)

Curious how easy it'll be to work with iPad and big video files tho, never really used many big files with their mobile products tablet or phone. I assume I'll basically have a dock strapped to it most of the time at the very least.


This is great news that is a long time coming. I wonder if they will eventually also do MainStage for iPad? That would revolutionize my workflow.


Wow, that only took way too god damn long.


Good news and it's dead cheap too


man, if this was a universal app with the subscription allowing you to use it on macOS too, that would be killer


I've edited using final cut and remember paying out the nose for 7. I'm not a fan of subscription models in the least, but Apple has been making editing tools affordable-ish for a while now and even if they switch to a subscription-based model for everything, it'll be reasonable. IMO $50/yr for the iPad version is definitely a *fair* price. Same goes for Photoshop. The $10 a month for Photoshop and Lightroom for people who need those professional tools is *fair*, especially if you're a small- to medium-sized studio that makes revenue off these products. And yeah, they'll probably switch to a subscription model for Final Cut X, but for those people who are making money off using Final Cut X, it'll be worth it.


Why would they not present it at WWDC?


Really wish it was either subscription or one-time. Interesting that Apple dropped the ‘X’ from the name, could signal a new subscription based version of FCP coming soon to mac?


We've been waiting for this since the first iPad Pro.


I may have missed it. What happens with those of use who already have Final Cut Pro?

I wonder if we can just share the existing version we have to the iPad Pro.


I’m very interested to see more of how that jog wheel In Final Cut Pro works

Beyond guttered to see it’s only ever in landscape orientation

I’ve been editing video on iPad for about 5 years now and the portrait orientation is so much more comfortable


I’m stoked about Logic Pro for IPad, but I didn’t read anything about using an interface, and midi controller with it like I do with GarageBand.


Finally! 

My ipad first gen will be useful again!


About time they made use of the new chipsets.


Well now that they have done that what will everyone complain about now? It will be interesting if people stick to their word about only using an iPad if they get Final Cut Pro and/or Logic Pro


“Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad will be available on the App Store as subscriptions starting Tuesday, May 23.” — Huh?! MacOS is a one-time purchase. Now we’d be subbing to it on iPad OS?


So can we get Xcode and a complete tool chain now? 

Or just macOS.


I’m betting that they were planning on doing this for at least a year or two or maybe more.


Oh fuck Daddy Apple 🤤🤤🤤


I’m so freaking pumped. Being able to work on both for the same project is going to be freaking awesome


Ok dumb question perhaps, but how do I interface my instruments with the iPad?  All through the usb port somehow with an input box?


APPLE DO FUCKING XCODE NEXT. Please for the love of god do xcode on iPad


Hm, as someone who uses logic pro every day professionally, this sounds not good. Plugins only  from the app-store, so simply moving my projects from my mac to the ipad will not work at all, as I never only use apple-only devices and filters. - Most apple-only plugins like alchemy are only available in a „light“version, like „Alchemy-sample“… bringing your own samples on the ipad also doesn‘t seem to be easy or encouraged, instead you should load the „free sample packs“ from their internal store…  monthly payment tops it off… I don‘t see me using this ever. Maybe if you have another workflow, as seen in the video „wow, strings you can play like a guitar!“


I wonder how they will approach this with businesses and schools. Currently there is no mechanism in Apple Business/School Manager to purchase subscriptions. Maybe subscriptions support is coming?


That’s amazing now just waiting for full adobe Photoshop on the iPads…


Is the subscription model for these two apps on ipad a prelude to what is to come on mac?

I was going to get a mac for logic pro and final cut. The last time I used logic was version 9. I thought in the long run the higher upfront cost of macbook is justified. Now I am not so sure.


I wonder if they'll bring MainStage to iPads now too?


Sounds great, but not doing the subscription thing.


[deleted]


Subscription model! 🙅‍♂️
$5 p/m or $50 p/y. Not that expensive though.


Subscription model..

Also this further guarantees iPad will never be able to run MacOS.


4,99 a month and 49,99 a year is a good price imo.


Not a fan of the subscription-based pricing. But we know this is going to be the future. I’ll likely be trying out Logic Pro over the summer.

(I wonder how well it’ll handle my Waves plug-ins before crashing…)


Yay so all of the content creators that said the “iPad wasn’t a computer” because it didn’t have Final Cut are now gonna shut the hell up for once!

Because the absence of Final Cut was TOTALLY the thing holding back iPadOS. These content creators are so out of touch…


It's about time.  Apple needs to lead the way with Pro apps on the iPad and it's taken way too long for it to happen.


Just put MacOS on this fucking thing and let me use it how I want.

EDIT: Oh my god, these are a fucking subscription? Gtfo.


Everyone complaining that it will be subscription based. The way I see it, since it is subscription based they will be a lot quicker to fix bugs and other issues because they don’t want to lose potential customers and revenue. 

Another thing is, it’s only a few dollars a month. Look at how much people spend on other subscriptions, ie Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and all the other stuff. At least with this, we get a 30 day try before you buy option.


Haha fuck this subscription bullshit. Ever wonder why Adobe gets their shit pirated out the wazoo?


[deleted]


I'm glad my ipad mini 5 gets the Logic Pro. I just hope it will run relatively smoothly.


Lol incredible. I got my 2018 Pro used but I can’t imagine being an early adopter into the iPad Pros and paying the full price and getting almost no pro functionality on it, and when they do roll it out it’s gated to the newer models with almost identical performance.


At least Resolve works on A15 Bionic chipset reasonable well if you need a powerful video editor.


I didn’t see it but my iPad Air M1 should be good right?


As someone whose an audio engineer and dabbles in production, having the ability to open logic sessions from clients or just start something on my iPad that isn’t limited to garage band and then open it on my MacBook Pro is going to be amazing. 

I’m also doing some video work for a social media company in LA and luma fushion is such a go to for simple things on the fly but Final Cut will absolutely be bonkers. 

Yeah, it’s a subscription. But if I even just add 5 bucks to each project I do within the fee, it’ll cover it and pay for itself and my clients wouldn’t give two shits for that price. 

I’m actually excited. Based on the video, the pencil will come in insanely handy allowing me to draw in automation better and write in funky unique text ( I have a good graffiti like penmanship so genuinely I’m stoked!)


Confusingly, on the page I looked at they used the “Third and Fourth Generation iPad Pro 11-inch” terminology. 

I could have sworn the third gen was the A12Z that I have. And if not, that really sucks!


2018 iPad Pro has the most longevity of any device I’ve owned. 5 years later and it’s still getting support for top tier apps like this.


Cries in A12z


They don’t want to steal the show away from Final Cut AR 🤣


[deleted]


Probably cut for time, given this year is (probably) the year we see the headset.


In the more recent years, they have had these “mini announcements” leading up to WWDC.


Yeah, exciting possibility here that they have so much to show that this is just a mere (extremely cool) throwaway.


Major version of Final Cut and Logic have traditionally not been announced at WWDC, and FCP in particular has often been announced at or around the [NAB Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAB_Show) in April. 

Final Cut Pro [major versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Cut_Pro#History) from 2003: 

* Final Cut Pro 4: April 2003 
* Final Cut Pro 5: April 2005
* Final Cut Pro 6: April 2007 
* Final Cut Pro 7: July 2009 
* Final Cut Pro X: April 2011 

Logic Pro [major versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Pro#Versions) from 2004: 

* Logic Pro 6: March 2004 
* Logic Pro 7: September 2004 
* Logic Pro 8: September 2007 
* Logic Pro 9: July 2009 
* Logic Pro X: July 2013 

I guess that's a side effect of the "WWDC is a software event! (so hardware is absent or rare)" myth that I hadn't thought of before. 

Just as some people think that hardware announcements at WWDC are much less common than they really are, there's a converse expectation that software announcements at WWDC are much more common than they really are.


They want that extra month of subscription revenue for May


I’d have expected that too, but I guess it makes sense as these are not for developers, they are ‚just‘ for (pro) users and while these (we) might watch wwdc, they are not the core audience


Perhaps we’ll get Xcode at wwdc which does seem a bit more in place for the conference compared to their media apps which I feel would have been better announced in either a spring or fall event.

Considering they’re willing to bring pro apps over Xcode no longer seems like a pipe dream and with swift playgrounds having app publishing capabilities perhaps swift playgrounds was just being used as a wide range test of publish on iPad before they brought out the big guns with Xcode.


[deleted]


I would like to know more about third-party plugins in Logic. Amp sims and drum plugins are a requirement for me.


Working with samples is going to reach another dimension with this, I’m really stoked about that part


Even the fifth gen from 2019 since it has the A12 as well!


I really want to see this!


“The world” like the 10,000 people who care


I love when media coverage gets rumors or predictions blatantly wrong


actions have consequences


Should show you how full of shit most of these Twitter leakers are, Kuo and maybe Gurman are the only two that have any real sources/info


Lmao they've deleted their account


Recall Mark Gurman's [tweet](https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1648381316302360576) from a few weeks ago: 

>Many of the details I’ve seen from this account are not true


This comment thread has aged like milk.


Mac version is a one off £300


Thanks for highlighting the part that matters.

Looks like I'll be sticking with Lumafusion forever....or at least until it becomes a subscription too, at which point I'll just find another hobby.


I hate subscriptions, however here’s a breakdown

$299.99 AUD on macOS

$59 AUD per year on iPadOS

The prices become even at the 5 year mark


Sigh... Could Apple at least have matched the price of LumaFusion? Subscriptions are ridiculous. I was excited when I first saw the ad and thought it would be a LumaFusion killer, but when I saw that it was offered on a subscription basis, I was like, "Nope, LumaFusion is here to stay."

I wouldn't do music or video editing on a tablet anyway. Touch interfaces for these use cases are too clunky IMO.

Now I hope this subscription model doesn't spread to the desktop version...


Premiere Pro (which only exists on desktops currently) starts with the mid-tier Adobe subscription that costs $20.99 per month.

It is hard to take people seriously who are griping about the prices Apple laid out here. For true professionals who would be making use of this software, the $50 annual subscription would be easily recouped.


Ya this is a hard nope for me. I like owning my software than renting it. If I stop paying for it I can't edit my old projects or start new ones. Not worth it


People who are interested in trying out those applications for a short period of time before making a final decision can now do it with $5 - $15, instead of $300.


Also, if you’re switching platforms, you can let go of the subscription and start it whenever you want.

There’s some good to subscriptions but it’s ideal if they can provide both options.


Good choice … makes it cost effective to play with it to validate use case


Looks like with Final Cut, they are providing a sort of content library instead of just a static product


Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me. It's not expensive, but I am really tired of supporting subscription models for everything. I already bought the apps on MacOS and would have loved to use Logic Pro on iPad. I would have even been down to pay another one time fee for the apps again, but at this point I have subscriptions for pretty much everything and it is becoming way too much.

The cost isn't even the issue. It's the fact that I already have like, 100000 other monthly subscriptions and they feel extremely predatory. It's easy to say, "oh this is only $5" but it definitely adds up.

I got into editing right when FCPX was released and loved it but got out of editing because no one used it for anything professional and now work in live events so have been out of the loop for a while. 

What reason would there be to use an iPad on set instead of a more powerful MacBook? I can see some instances where an iPad with a usbc hard drive stuck to the back could be useful, but a MacBook just seems so much faster.


[deleted]


Honestly - as someone in the ‘industry’ Final Cut lost a ton of ground when they released version 10. So you’re absolutely right - the only people cheering are Apple YouTubers. Adobe is basically swallowing up the industry - even at a high level (those that used to use Avid systems)


That gives me more hope for what I want: more news about the reality headset.

No, not going to buy it, but I want more news about. I want to see where they are going to go with it.

Because I don't want to leave the future of the meta verse to Zuck.


Another 5 years and we may even see Mac OS on the m7 haha


Delete this before Tim sees


if they convert current Logic Pro users to a subscription model people will just jump shit to Ableton or FLat that point.


Just you watch me switching back to Garage Band out of spite.


Better buy it😅


Does the subscription get me access to both the macOS and iOS versions?


If they don't exempt people who already paid, or at least grandfather in some of the original buyers for free...seems like a dick move no?


I doubt it. Subscriptions would discourage many users from upgrading their OS which is a problem because there are times you need your userbase to update: see security updates.


I’ve been using logic for nearly a decade now, and the recent uptick in people getting into audio production has really saturated the market with subscription models; won’t be surprised if there’s some serious backlash to carrying that model to the mac. I know I’d switch DAWs at that point


To seasoned videographers, it’s sounds kinda strange, but to students/newcomers, it’s a good marketing push.

Shoot, edit, export, and upload videos all using a single device.


Final Cut Pro on desktop costs $300 for a one-time purchase, so it's effectively pre-paying for six years of updates.  Based on the version history, FCP desktop has already gotten six years worth of updates, so I guess it's a wash?  I guess it's better if you only sub for the months/years you need it.


Adobe Premiere Pro costs $20.99/mo.
I don't like subscriptions, but $4.99/mo is not a bad deal.


I see it as an emergency edit tool only. 
I will still use Final Cut Pro on my mac for 99% of editing. 
But if there is a case, where I don’t have access to my computer and have my iPad with me.  Sure why not. 
Beats paying 399 for an iPad version of an app I already own. 
1 month free trial too. 

I don’t see anyone becoming a pro at the iPad version.


Subscription means you don't own the product. I don't want my tools to have subscriptions.


Subscription pricing pretty much guarantees I’ll never use these apps. Bummer.

DaVinci Resolve Studio for iPad is a one off payment, and they have a great history of dates for life. It’s also got the best colour grading tools of any NLE, and they feel super natural on iPad with the pencil.


I think the monthly subscription model has found more of a home in the iOS/mobile ecosystem than desktop software (Adobe and MS, excepted). Maybe people can't fathom running software that costs hundreds of dollars on a device small enough to fit in your pocket.


I agree with this point, but even if that's the case, why not offer a lifetime purchase option in addition to a monthly subscription?


I’m happy about it. I use both apps and I would maybe use the iPad versions sometimes but I definitely don’t want to buy them again outright.


Davinci Resolve having an entry cost of $0 kills any other editing software for people getting into media.

Considering there were video editing apps for iPad before this, it’s literally always made sense


The fact that I can just open my GarageBand files in Logic for the iPad is going to be amazing. The Automation limitations of GarageBand for iPad forced me to nest so many projects. Now Logic will just do it in one. AU plug-ins will still work, so I everything I’ve done on GarageBand should just carry over. And it looks like the best parts of GarageBand are in Logic, like the multi-touch instruments and pencil support.


Yeah, the biggest mistake they ever made. Aperture ruled.


Calculator


Xcode for iPad


That is a subscription... lmfao


The subscription model

The fact you probably won't be able to install whatever AUs you want in Logic

The fact it's on a tiny screen

Take your pick! You'll read some combination of all 3 over the next week.


I'm still annoyed about them killing Aperture.


Calculator, Health, Wallet, and. XCode. Oh, and Apple Music classic and the full Fitness app.


My thoughts exactly. Why should we pay some extra fee when we already paid full price on Mac


Enjoy that while it lasts. I’m guessing there’s a future where FCP is subscription only on Mac.


Are you unfamiliar with the many, many subscription services that Apple offers? 😅


I think everything is going to be subscription soon enough. Pretty soon the OS will be a subscription. Hardware definitely will be. Very sad.


Check out 'Olive'. I found it yesterday - https://www.olivevideoeditor.org


You’re not alone.

I have an an older generation iPadPro, I’ve purchased a few creative tools for it (like ProCreate), but I never use it for creative work.

I tried said tools, but working on iPad is just unbearably limiting compared to working on my 27 inch iMac in every way I can think of.


You're probably not alone,. but it's cool now that a new option exists. (Customers who might only have an iPad,. now have an option). Options are always good.


It’s Audio Units v3 and it works in both mac and iPad. And most plugin developers make both au and vst when they develop their plugins


I feel you. At least I can get Logic Pro and mess around with it before I upgrade mine to next year's model.


I’m not sure I agree, I feel like Final Cut has been getting slow and steady updates consistently.


Well, this is one such new update no?

It’s not a simple port. It’s remade for touch right?


Not after 6 years. $50 per year versus $300 for life.


[deleted]


It's not really the exact same app, is it? I'd imagine there's at least a couple features missing


That just means they're going to move Mac version to subscription soon. More money for business.


[deleted]


Well of course. Apple is going to milk it’s fanbase for every penny they have. Apple is showing you that you will never truly own your products. You can only rent them from Apple.


Ok but look at the price. It’s way more expensive on desktop.


Ok but Logic and Final Cut weren’t announced when you bought that iPad. Did you buy a 2020 iPad with the hope that one day you could use Final Cut on it?


One of the main features of the iPad version is Pencil support. Drawing waveforms and trimming tracks is very easy with the pencil. Otherwise, the apps still support keyboard and mouse. Lots of the same shortcuts and plugins are supported too.

USB-C with a dock or hub means you can connect all of your equipment (midi keyboard, guitar, microphone, monitor headphones).

Under the right conditions, the iPad is lighter and more portable.


Need to rebuy all plugins from the apple store, if they even exist. Since the licensing system is completely different from Desktop. Apple forces purchases through the app store, it makes it impossible for developers to bundle iOS and Desktop licenses together in a package. Beyond technical issues, the business decision of generating more revenue by existing owners needing to rebuy will probably win for most developers.


yeah i thought the same thing


They dropped the X from the names of the products on Mac back in 2020.


[deleted]


That’s in the app’s official page on the Apple website. You can plug in MIDI interfaces into the iPad Logic Pro app


They'll complain about the subscription pricing. Oh wait, it's already started.


Probably best for sketching out ideas, and doing the heavy stuff on desktop machines ?


a subscription model for a heavy duty app that needs regular updates makes sense, and apple is pricing very fairly here

the real problem with the subscription model is every tiny app that used to be like <$10 one time purchase decided they're going to charge $50 a year


Even if you are using it as a casual, 4.99 to cut and edit and publish is super cheap.


I agree. Updates for FCP on the Mac have been extraordinarily slow. Probably related to low financial incentive.


Yeah, except pirating stuff on ipadOS isn't as easy


iPad Air M1 seems like the best way to go for iPad at the moment


I was considering the m1 iPad Air, but for 350 extra, I was able to get an 11 inch m2 iPad Pro with 512gb. My iPad Pro 1st gen is in it’s eighth year, so I was looking to future proof the iPad Pro I have now upgrade to. I am over the moon that I can connect the same 8tb external hard drive I use for my Mac on my iPad, but I still need the space as I don’t want to lug that hard drive around with me everywhere.


Final cut pro ran like a dream on the M1 Macbook. This is what we should expect tbh


The whole iPad lineup doesn’t make sense at this point.


Friend , for what its worth atleast you get stage manager, usb c and pencil 2. Imagine my plight as a 10.5 (2017) user...


The performance jump from the 2018/2020 to M1 is huge though.


I mean, pretty pro of it to go 5+ years with updates and not a single hiccup in performance. I still edit 5K drone videos with it and Lightroom Mobile gives me zero slowdowns with 50MB+ TIFF files. 120hz display too. 

Can’t really say the same for the rest of the tablet market..


[deleted]


I bought my 2018 brand new about a month after launch so I could get a small discount. It was state-of-art when it launched and I still enjoy and use it daily. Tim Cook is probably massively pissed off Apple made an iPad this good that users like me have yet to feel compelled to upgrade yet. (And I'm typically a serial upgrader).

In no way do I feel "cheated" by Apple because of this news. Geez it's a nearly 5 year old model. Tech moves forward.


This is funny, but also a really well crafted AR/VR version of editing software would be REALLY cool, being able to drag and drop stuff anywhere you want.


More like they want to distract people from geolocked sideloading only in places that threatened them legally if they don't enable it.


I imagine people working in those traeadmill setups on VR timelines like they’re fixing a railroad


Both of those applications still have a good value proposition with their licensing models.


LumaFusion is more like a way better version of iMovie, it's not nearly as feature rich as FCP and Davinci Resolve.

But FCP is direct competition for Davinci Resolve. Sucks to be Black Magic Studio.


Lumafusion is on iPhone. FCP is not on iPhone & Older iPads. They'll be fine


You'd probably get a good laugh out of it, no one is going to wear a headset 8+ hours a day for work, that sounds miserable.


This has been one of the top feature requests since the iPad Pro was first announced. Really odd to me that this wasn't shown on stage.


Yup. They did the same thing a few years ago in the weeks leading up to WWDC


If any pro software was to be announced at wwdc I’d expect Xcode to be announced first and considering swift playgrounds has App Store publishing support it doesn’t seem completely out there they could bring it over. Perhaps they announced logic and Final Cut now so they didn’t have tons of people asking about it if Xcode is announced but they wouldn’t have to spend much show time on it.


Oh, I know. But the iPad mini’s portability is unmatched. And I’m sort of used to cramped workspaces haha


Same here. I’m only a talentless hobbyist but I’ve got close to £1000 worth of Arturia instrument plug-ins which I’d like to use. But if anything *does* happen then I wouldn’t expect anything for a while. 

At the moment I doodle on my iPad in Korg Gadget, which is an amazing piece of software considering its price and age, then export the midi files and transfer them to my Mac then import into Logic. It works well at my level but a continuous workflow sounds very appealing even if I have to pay for Logic again.


If I can get this sucker to run Helix Native then I'm in business, otherwise it's probably a pass for me.


Especially knowitall nerds like this "I hope everyone knows when I said..."


“Media” this is just a random ass Twitter account looking for drama. So far this sub made that account successful


They clearly meant a Galactic Standard Year, which is what... A Galactic Standard Week is one hour, so a GSY is 52 hours, which is a little over two days.  Yeah, I'll say they were pretty spot on.


lol silly apple never pays attention


I kinda wonder if Apple released both just to throw water on the credibility of that account.


This tweet is most certainly what got their sister fired from apple. We won’t be hearing from them again.


Uhhh It’s pretty clear he has real sources just based on him having this info in the first place. The curveball is Apple giving the wrong dates, probably on purpose to catch the leakers from inside.


Also even if they have sources, leaks for a phone or device that is 1 year out are still not reliable. That is a lot of time for things to change at Apple. So always take what they say with a grain of salt.


they had to. they got into huge trouble

As much as I dislike subscription models for software, for pro level software it feels a bit different as you practically *need* to be on the latest version.

So if $49 per year ends up being 5-6 years to reach the current one-off purchase price, that’s really not bad at all, and roughly aligns with -if not better than- major upgrade cycles.


Was hoping my Mac version of logic pro would just work on my iPad...cause you know I already bought the app. So much for buy one app and use on all your devices.


[deleted]


This is such a double dip. You should be able to buy or subscribe and it works for both devices. Why should someone pay twice just because it’s on an iPad and not out and about with a MacBook?


Only last week did I get the trial for Logic Pro because I was done with the subscription model of Pro Tools. I was ready to drop the $300AUD on Logic and learn how a totally new workflow but now this has me thinking that the Mac version will go subscription sometime soon.


Break even is even further on down if you factor in inflation (assuming subscription price doesn’t rise; which is not certain).


Good point!


Yes, but FCP on macOS has been $300 for almost a full decade.


I’d rather have the option to actually own it


iPad Pro uses a mouse just fine, and I have found that the Pencil is actually pretty cool to use for it. Less clunky than I would have thought.


Honestly, it probably will come to Desktop. About time for me to buy it outright I suppose


You’re using Premiere as an example as if people don’t hate Adobe’s price scheme with a passion

Let’s talk about DaVinci Resolve that’s free for most, and $295 one time for people that need higher end features.


I don’t disagree that $5 a month is super cheap for professionals that make their living with Final Cut Pro, but we should acknowledge video editing isn’t the center of everybody’s workflow.

I don’t blame anybody for subscription fatigue if they’ve got a subscription for Word/Excel/365, Cinema4D/Redshift, Photoshop/Illustrator, CaptureOne, iCloud, 1Password, Figma, Jira, Backblaze etc and that’s before getting into entertainment subscriptions.


For me it's more the principle of losing the opportunity of perpetual license ownership in favor of perpetual license renting.


Software for professionals is priced weird.

Microsofts development system (Visual Studio) costs 45 usd a month for the cheap version and *250 usd a month* for the high-end one.

Its competitor, Intellij, charges about 460 usd a year (first year, gets cheaper) for their product. So thats less than 2 months of the MS version.

However if you buy Rider not as a company, they will only charge you 164 USD.

And if you are a company, none of these prices matters as it will cost you more than that a day to employ me to use them.


Definitely agree that griping about subscription pricing for pro-creative tools feels like yearning for a bygone era, for better or worse. 

That said, I have pretty serious doubts that many professional video editors will find $5/mo of value from Final Cut on iPad - sounds like the macOS project files can't be natively opened by the iPad (and iPad -> Mac only works via an "export"), which kneecaps the practical workflow pretty hard.


[deleted]


You can try Logic on Mac for 3 months free…


Both Final Cut and logic have free trials on the mac!


Exactly!

Plus, for me that is mainly planning to use it while recording away from my studio can opt to pay when I’m doing it as opposed to buying it for a single cost. Since the yearly cost is low, I’m open to it. 

But what’s more interesting is how VIs and plugins will work. I saw a note that it supported AU, but it had to be downloaded of the the App Store.


I would love it if parallels could do that. Two weeks was not enough for me to test what I wanted (not the softwares fault, just busy) but I’m not ready to spend almost 175$CDN for one year of it.


Comes with a 1-month free trial as well, apparently.


Sure, but those versions of Final Cut Studio had tons of software and was making major inroads on being used to edit feature films such as No Country for Old Men (+other Coen brother movies), Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Social Network, etc.

The $300 standalone Final Cut Pro X was the ground up redesign of the app in 2011 that cut tons of software and features and caused Hollywood to abandon Final Cut and re-entrenched Avid Media Composer as the only way to edit feature films.

Prosumer users fleeing Final Cut Pro X also gave rise to the previously unpopular Premiere Pro when Adobe seized the moment and released an emergency CS5.5 update that overhauled Premiere to more closely mimic Final Cut Pro 7. Premiere used to be in the category of Sony Vegas until they jumped on the moment to scoop up Final Cut’s prosumer refugees.


In the years since, Apple has added many of the missing features back into Final Cut Pro X (eventually dropping the X), and in the last five or so years Final Cut Pro has found a strong market with winning back YouTubers from Premiere Pro (thanks to Adobe doing a shit job optimizing Premiere).

FCPX is doing decently well in the YouTuber / prosumer space (although DaVinci Resolve has been the rising star), but at best it’s simply not trying to do the same thing as the incredible old boxed Final Cut Studio of the past.. Although if I’m being honest FCP7 absolutely dominated the prosumer space AND was starting to get real use in more demanding Hollywood productions, while FCPX is just doing decently well in just the prosumer space.

Hell, even any big Oscar winning movies edited with Final Cut in the last few years such as Parasite are still edited with the over a decade old boxed version of Final Cut Pro 7.

Sorry for the too long reply, just wanted to say that the name may be inherited from the old $1000 boxed version, but it’s not the same thing.


They’ll get advanced copies before the public release later this month and we’ll get to see tons of YouTubers trying it out.


I still find it shocking they abandoned the pro industry right as they were starting to see some adoption among professional editors.  But I'm still bitter I paid $1k for FCS four months before they launched X for $300.


As a professional editor I’m cheering for my personal projects, even if I’ll keep using premiere for work.


What are you talking about? Adobe is steadily losing ground to Da Vinci Resolve. And final cut is widely respected as a solid alternative for speed and efficiency.

Your comment sounds like it was written in 2016


Logic isn't exactly popular, either. Ableton, Pro Tools and Cubase are easily king on the high end. FL Studio is popular among hobbyists, and a sizable portion seem to use REAPER and Studio One as well.

And DAWs are honestly the smallest part too. It's easy to own thousands of dollars worth of VSTs for instruments and effects. I own the Arturia V collection, which is worth several hundred right there. I don't see that, or Kontakt/Komplete, Serum or whatever being on an iPad.


Yep, Adobe is a huge unspoken about monopoly problem and for the most part I like using Adobe products.

They raise enterprise rates for Adobe all the time. Had a former boss rant to me about it and problem was there is nothing he could do about it because we relied on Adobe software and the vendors expected files to be delivered using Adobe file formats and compatibility.


It put a lot us in a position where we can't ever trust them again too. The years waiting for FCP 8 only to get X left a bad taste for a lot of people, same as slow 'pro' hardware updates.


They say we’ll see something like that next year


~~You’re~~ Investors are gonna love it!


🙏


Reaper


I think they meant the MacOS versions of this software, as both applications are currently buyable I believe, but the iPad versions will be rentable only.


Final Cut Pro X for desktop has gotten 12 years of updates, which is still absurdly good when you account for the first few years being really really rough


FCP X has been continuously updated since 2012, so over ten years.


And that is how they get you. “Oh I don’t like subscriptions but price XX is better than YY” that other product started pricing like that at some point.


It's fine for me. There are times when I need editing software for a few days but don't want to pay for it for a whole year


[deleted]


The lock-in of the app store must be a big part of the reason for this. If they'd have offered developers proper upgrade pricing then I'm not sure subscription based apps would be the norm in quite the way that they now are


Hard to imagine very many people buying a $300 iPad app though.


Subscription is also an incentive for them to keep developing the app. If they stop improving it, people will stop paying for it.


I remember this exact scenario in high school where I filmed a group project on my iPhone 4 and tried to use iMovie to edit it. Now, I know iMovie has had several updates since, but the feature set was so limited in iMovie that I couldn’t do transitions or have more than one song playing so all I basically got out of it was the ability to crop and stitch videos together. 

For an important video that needs a little more than the bare minimum in terms of production, I’d pay $5 to use Final Cut for a month.


Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro are both very complex and fully-fledged pro apps, they're also widely used in their respective industry. Yet a Calculator is too much for the iPad.


PCalc Lite is free. My favourite calculator app, I just keep it hidden in slideover view for easy access.


Might actually be coming given this announcement


https://i.imgur.com/KG8e6Zv.jpg

Third party AUs are a thing, however it sounds like in the form of an app? These already exist, and are significantly less popular to the already existing AUs that you just download and install. Now a developer has to pay to put the app on the App Store.

It’s not a good look to push even more plugins away. It’s already a pain, but that’s Apple in their “we know best” attitude.


Oh man I didn’t even think about vsts. I’m an ableton user but I respect logic, and I’m looking forward to messing around with it on iPad.


I’m gonna be so annoyed seeing the same YouTubers complaining those apps weren’t on iPad  now complaining that the screen is too small (even though they have been asking for it for years)


A streaming service is different than an application we’re using on our own devices without any additional resource required from the creator of the given tool.

Using subscription model in the latter case is pure greed.


Funny, cause Procreate is on of the apps that I could never replicate on a Mac. It’s THE iPad app.


"Life" is really "until they release Final Cut Pro 11".


All the more reason to just include it under the Mac model.

Have it so that buyers of the Mac version would also get this version and vice versa.


6 years of subscription or one time $300. 

Not bad honestly 

Also pay $5 whenever you need to use it and then stop paying. Easy.


I paid for these apps for Mac one off like ten years ago and they still work perfect today, if I'd been paying a subscription that whole time I'd have paid far more than I have


Paying for 5 years of subscription on iPadOS is the same cost as the macOS app

Worthwhile in my opinion, even though I hate subscriptions.


Makes sense! Thanks for your input!


I love mine. One day I’d like to upgrade to a iPad Pro for the bigger screen size, but other than that I can’t see why I’d need to upgrade for a while.


Provided you haven’t yet been spoiled by 120hz screens.


If you want Final Cut that is

If you don’t care about Final Cut, I’m still team get a refurb/used 4th gen iPad Air for much cheaper and it still does all the same iPad stuff


That makes it extra sad that I had to get the M2 pro for double the price because I wanted the larger screen


[deleted]


[deleted]


Just replaced my 10.5 Pro with an M2 Pro. My 10.5 was a trooper since I got it at launch and I probably could've got another year or so out of it if it wasn't for the near-dead battery and 64gb of storage


That’s where I was. Volume button gave out and decided to upgrade. M2 pro is pretty sweet. Not a huge upgrade for what I use it for though.


Yeah you don't notice too much of a performance difference between them currently but that is because nothing on the iPad can really stress the processors. 

This could also be a ram thing as well I don't think anything before the M1 had 8GB+ of ram.


Not really, though. It's pretty much a normal generational leap. The M1 is exactly what you'd expect to see from a presumptive A14x.


M1 can drive a laptop, I think people forget how huge this was for the platform. People might be too used to incremental improvements that such a jump is forgotten. I feel bad for those who got an intel mac just before the apple silicon came out, the difference was  big.


It's been tried, but 1.) The hand tracking is really hard, especially in detail (Leap Motion has done pretty well at this but it's still not great, and basically impossible in VR) 2.) It's exhausting, very quickly. I built some Leap/Oculus gesture interfaces back when Oculus was still in beta and it really only was practical for a short demo, after which your shoulders would get really really tired if you weren't a competitive swimmer or rock climber or archer or something. We're just not designed or conditioned to have our arms extended forward for long periods of time.


As someone who works in the industry, editing by flailing your arms sounds like pure hell, my shoulders hurt just by thinking about it. And managing a 20 something layer timeline without keyboard shortcuts, sounds like a real productivity killer.


AND JESUS WEPT! For there where no more worlds to conquer.


It’s not gonna bother Blackmagic design in the slightest 

LumaFusion will be feeling the pinch

Their big move over the last two years doing multicamera has ended up being a huge misstep

But obviously they knew this was gonna happen eventually, which is why they’re on android now. 

I just hope they go back to their roots and focus on making a great touch based editor.


This is a long running thing.  Some people love FCP, others hate it.  Since FCP X it has been a very distinctly non-standard approach.

Blackmagic Design/Resolve will be fine.


They’ve co-existed on Max for years.


Davinci has a free tier, though, and it's pretty fully-featured. Apple waited so long to do this that I think some folks have given up on FCP and moved their workflows over and it'll be hard to entice them to come back.


Not so much - if you’re already into their ecosystem with Resolve on desktop this is interesting but not life-changing. 

Now, if fucking ADOBE would get their asses together and get Premiere on there…


BM still has the people who edit on a PC and need an otg solution. Which I imagine is more people than edit on the Mac.

Remember if you are used to davince resolve you are not going to change to FCP. They are more likely scared of the day Premier goes iPad.

Blackmagic is more of a hardware company, isn’t it?


It really doesn't, resolve is on the rise and they're not locked behind a subscription paywall. There's those that love FCP, but I see resolve used far more regularly than the former


also, no subscription model


Who says they're not going to mention it on stage too? They'll likely fit it in somewhere.


They'll probably mention it on stage. And it was probably cut for time since the rumored AR headset is dropping.


I’m betting they’ll announce some sort of Xcode for iPad Pro instead.


Also announcing FCP for iPad doesn’t really mean that much for developers unless it comes with a plugin software story. The D in WWDC stands for developer, not video editor.


The Mini 6 is perfect for porn! *perfect!*


Yep, same boat here! Helix Native and Slate drums, then I’m good. Though a decent alternative to Slate would be fine by me.

I’m also including Gurman from Bloomberg and rumor mill sites like MR and 9to5. I love when any of them are completely wrong, in addition to these twitter accounts that think they’re the next great source.


Lol of course not


Out of all the little conspiracy theories you could have come up with, this is the least likely one.


Literally anyone could have guessed that EVENTUALLY these apps would hit iPad, doesn't prove real sources at all

Reminds me of Jon Prosser once saying in APRIL 2020 that these apps were coming to iPad "within the next year or so". Ended up taking over three years from that tweet. These guys are just guessing


Wow you definitely nailed it, the leaker just said that’s exactly what happened and now Apple is coming after him and his sister who was his source at Apple.


I mean we’ve been talking about this for years in here.


As much as I'm excited for these apps, the subscription model is all the justification I need to continue ramping up in Resolve and Live.  If the macOS versions of Final Cut and Logic go subscription-only (or if I simply end up liking the alternatives better), I'm switching.


at WWDC: “*major changes coming to FCP! now only $9.99/mo! you’re gonna love it, and you’re gonna pay for it!*”


I completely agree, I already have Final Cut on the Mac. Why would I get an iPad over a MacBook? This pricing model makes the iPad less appealing. I am waiting on wwdc to make a purchase and it looks like there will be no meaningful changes to the iPad. So, MacBook Air it is.


Thank you


WWDC is less than 90 days away so if you do purchase, I think they’ll more than likely give you a refund.

This happened with an app I bought recently, and it turned to subscription and I was able to get a full $80 AUD refund


I hope not! One of the good things about FCP and Logic is that it's a one-time purchase and not a subscription!


Resolve Studio also comes bundled with Blackmagic cameras. It's an absolute bargain no matter how you acquire it.

I agree with the sentiment of wanting to just own the thing you use, but at some point the perpetual ownership stops because the software is no longer gets updates and you have to buy the new software. Back before everything was a subscription, you were shelling out money every so often to buy the new version of the product.


that ship sailed years ago


I get that, but people are acting like this is something new.

The Adobe Creative Suite has been subscription based since 2013, not to mention Avid as well. This announcement only seems to be flummoxing people who were never the target demographic for this software in the first place.


But your perpetual license to ownership comes with the expectation of perpetual updates to the software which introduces an inherent disconnect.


There’s a way to reset the trial period too, so you never have to actually buy it


There’s a way to have the 90 day trial for final cut pro on mac forever, all you have to do is enter one command in terminal once the trial period is done and it resets


lol do you really think the people celebrating in this thread know anything about the Mac counterpart


Thats very interesting, and really sad. I like software that is being made better, but I hate it when they gimp professional tools.

Out of curiosity: do you know what they edit the Apple TV+ with?


I guess QuickTime X and the discontinuation of ~~Motion~~ Shake were canaries in the coal mine in hindsight.


I miss how good Aperture was too.


Yep you and I both. The day Apple sought after the mass audience with FCX was the day I started looking for options. Naturally I was using Adobe in my day to day - and they (Adobe) just made it harder to get away from it as they integrated their software so seamlessly into their Creative Cloud Library system. Jumping between PS, AFX, Ilustrator and Premiere - with a team of 10 has been nothing short of brilliant on Adobes part.

Still have my issues with Adobe - but there’s a reason it’s the most utilized software for teams larger than 1.


Oh not in the industry it’s not. In the creator space - sure, Resolve has been eating into Adobe’s realm…but  it for large corporate teams, in my 20+ years, I haven’t worked for an agency that even considers anything but Adobe.  

I use Resolve and used to use FCX for my creator projects - but for anything work related it’s all Adobe.

Us long-timers remember $1100, $700, I think $300 for Logic Express… these prices are reasonable, even if I do hate the subscription model on principal


Do you have to pay again for major releases?


Yeah how dare they undercut competition and “get” me by offering their product at a much lower price point.


Yes it does but we'll see how it works with FCP, hopefully they thought of this. I think if you want to go hard with this though you should still use the Mac version


Not if they've locked in their users, then they can stop improving it, but people will still have to pay for it to access functionality and data. 

That's why I like the traditional upgrade model as well as the pseudo-subscription where you pay for (say) 1 year of updates and after that year you get no more updates unless you pay again, but you keep whatever you have.


You've got it reversed. 

The Calculator that Apple is working for the iPad is so complex and high-end, it's going to make FCP and Logic Pro look like the iPhone calculator in comparison.


Press X to doubt


It's clearly a sketchpad for ideas and not really meant for full-scale production. To that end, it's the perfect travel tool. Start up a rough draft on the iPad, get home and load the file into the desktop version via iCloud.

That, alone, is probably worth it for a lot of people.


You must understand; you cannot ever be happy. Something must always be wrong. This is the way!


The screen functionality actually looks great with how it scales when you are doing things. Apple has been working on this for years.


Are you unfamiliar with the many, many greedy moves that apple pulled for the past few years ?


It’s been 12 years. So that’s $25 a year so far.


And then 10 becomes unuseable ?


I think we are past the point of them releasing new versions like that


[deleted]


You still own your program, instead of it turning into a pumpkin after those years. This is what you aren’t thinking about. You’ve paid for 6 years and then on day - boom - you’ve got nothing, unless you keep paying.

F that noise. Resolve and Luma Fusion all the way!


>	 if I’d been paying a subscription that whole time I’d have paid far more than I have

Thats’s why everything is subscription-based now


And if you stop using the software, either because you no longer need to edit videos, or just find something you like better, you can just stop subscribing and save the additional money you would've paid up front.


if it had 120hz there'd be no reason to go pro. at all.


I have an 12.9" M1 Pro and M1 Air, and I use the M1 Air more because the size is really nice.


I cant tell the difference between 120hz and 60hz


There's a few other things that are M1-exclusive like external display multitasking support, and we can assume that Apple won't be going out of their way to build exciting new pro software for pre-M1 iPads, so I wouldn't recommend people buy a pre-M1 iPad Air or Pro at this point.

The iPad 5th gen would be more excusable as it's cheaper and you wouldn't expect the same level of support


Thank you! I’m also hoping that this iPad will be the machine that I can create and launch my YouTube channel from (hence the 512gb size!)

Couldn’t the AR/VR inplementation be mostly visual, and not include VR controllers/ motion control?

What was wrong with it? Was adding multi cam support the reason why my playback got unbearably slow to start? I’m talking like 2-3 seconds between hitting play and it actually starting. It seems like it got better recently.


I really hate FCP X compared to what it was before. It’s so much less intuitive for me and I feel like I have less control. Was a shame to see that happen.


Everyone I knew jumped off FCP when X came out.


Absolutely.  Davinci resolve was perfect for me. I held out on FCP 7 for years and would use premiere at a job that paid for the license. Resolve is very full featured in the free version more features than the other systems I used.  It works extremely well on the M1s- and if I ever needed to upgrade for higher end workflows the price is still extremely competitive.   For me apple fudged it years ago. Love editing on Macs but when I upgraded to an M1 iMac I switched to davinci resolve easily and have never looked back or regretted it.


People are leaving Premiere in their droves. Their user base is gigantic so it may not be too damaging long term, but as things stand DaVinci Resolve is the one garnering all the attention. This announcement from Apple definitely won’t change that. It’s still the same unpopular software (although of the 3 it’s probably the one most suited to touch screen).


Yea, but a one-timer. 25 for the app, 99 to add in cloud/effects/some other things


Apple has published a lengthy Newsroom article and a 2-min YouTube video for this announcement. I think the whole point was to push it out of the WWDC Keynote. Also the WWDC is primarily for devs, FCP is for video editors. Thus not exactly a great fit.

He’s also the one that started the leak for pill cut outs and the haptic volume buttons (which apparently is delayed to next year) and action button instead of mute switch. 

Let’s not be disingenuous here, these are not random shots in the dark.


I still think my favorite Prosser fails have been iOS 13 going back to being called iPhoneOS around WWDC 2019 or the squared Apple Watch when the Series 7 design was "leaked" and Apple didn't change the design, just the screen


Last year, "Majin Bu" [claimed](https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1504822459446530055) that Apple was developing Final Cut for the iPad. 

>Apple is working on a version of Final Cut for the iPad.  I know it's not on par with the Pro (it doesn't manage plugins locally) and there is no upcoming launch.  I don't know anything else at the moment.  I believe it is an interface to manage projects saved on iCloud.

The one specific claim is the lack of (local) plugins, which he may be right about—I see no mention of plugins for FCP in the press release. But what Apple announced looks like much more than just a project manager.


It was an intentional misdirect from Apple. That’s how they caught them by giving everyone a different release date


[deleted]


I think this is my cue to go ahead and buy Final Cut next time I can afford it. I don’t even use it, but I would like to in the future. It would be lawsuit hell if Apple tried to force users that have already paid to go to a subscription, at least not without an entirely “new” app, so I may as well get ahead of it. 

Or pirate. Because I find piracy morally superior than aiding a subscription-based society.


lol. Live is $800USD. Logic easily has thousands of dollars in native plugins. If you’re looking at it from a financial perspective, Logic obviously wins by a thousand country miles. But this is the iPad version anyway, which Ableton doesn’t have. This argument is weird on every level.


I mean, Live and Logic are *very* different programs with very different capabilities. I feel like if you’re doing the kind of thing that would work well in Live then that’s the way to go, but it feels like a pretty narrow band of music production modes that benefit from its unique design. Don’t get me wrong, I think Live is an incredible tool, but no one is tracking drums or composing instrumental scores with it, you know?


It’s more like free DaVinci Resolve is a free-but-limited copy of FCP, so you still get the full experience with the free version - edit using the same UI, timelines, etc - but when you try to use source footage in certain video formats, or click on half the effects plugins, you instead get a popup saying “buy me”. So as long as you don’t have any use for the features that the paid version adds (or can find free workarounds), it’s practically the same program. 

That’s pretty different from iMovie vs FCP, where the workflows, UI, and even general concepts, are *drastically* different.


Nope, free DaVinci is similar to Final Cut Pro if it blocked a couple of features behind a paywall. It’s perfectly usable without paying.

iMovie is a fundamentally different app with a different workflow


This comment was edited in June 2023 as a protest against the Reddit Administration's aggressive changes to Reddit to try to take it to IPO. Reddit's value was in the users and their content. As such I am removing any content that may have been valuable to them. RIP Apollo


i think that’s still a good option to have available. especially for software that doesn’t *require* the use of cloud saves or other databases. i remember using an old version of sony vegas pro for editing, years ago and it worked wonderfully


I'm fine with that.  See my comments in reply to Fickle\_Dragonfly4381.


It's waning, yes, but not completely gone.  Both Logic and Final Cut have competitors which (at least for now) do not have a subscription licensing model.


Not true for me.  I'm A-OK with versioned software.  I'll gladly take it if an application vendor chooses to make new versions of software with new features available to those are purchased a license for a previous version, but I don't *expect* it.

What I feel is reasonable and fair is to license versions of software with a distinct set of features and support them with bug fixes for a reasonable amount of time.  If/when the developer creates new features for the software I'm completely fine with them version-bumping the software with those features and charging a fee for a license to use that version.  As a customer it'd be up to me to decide if I want/need to pay for those new features or not.  If the older version still suits my needs, I'm fine sticking with that version (missing new features and all).  This is precisely how I currently license Capture One, for example.


Would you mind sharing that command… for research purposes?


I don’t have any insight there, but the behind the scenes tools to make AppleTV+ shows are probably left to the discretion of the production companies / editing houses.

If I had to guess it’s probably Avid Media Composer because the industry is quite consolidated around that, but as I said I have no specific insight into any AppleTV+ shows.


In case you are curious, Avid is built for 50+ people collaborating on the same project and that alone is enough to keep it in use.

DaVinci has stepped their collaboration tools up, but that’s still new.


Also Avid has the benefit of being entrenched in the muscle memory of editors who have been editing for 30 years and have no desire to change, and Avid is happy to cater to those editors. The workflow is quite annoying to get started in, and lots of things are not there because they’re better but instead because they’re holdovers from editing before computers were involved. Avid veterans fly through the program, but if you don’t already have the muscle memory it’s less than ideal. Changing the habits of feature films editors is very much an uphill battle


When was Motion discontinued? I used it today.


Just talked about this the other day with someone. I miss Aperture so much. So much better than Lightroom!


This. The issue isn't about Premiere itself but when you work in a team setting, Premiere becomes the only viable option when everyone on a creative team is also using Photoshop, Illustrator and other apps in the Adobe ecosystem and you need to have your assets match on the same campaign.


Lol I haven't seen this in 10 years thank you for this, I remember being kinda triggered by it as a staunch defender of FCP X back in the day

The problem with subscription is they get you hooked and then steadily raise monthly rate.


No


It’s more about the subscription model. You said you don’t like subscriptions in your post. Then you said that the price is fair. 

My point is that. No price in any subscription model is fair. It’s always a rip off. For decades buying software on a license basis has worked just fine. 

Subscription is BS. Apple should make these apps 150$ straight up.


Well then, it’s going to cost $4.99 monthly and they think you’re going to love it!


[deleted]


Yeah it definitely looks and seems to work well but we all know that will be the next “issue”


I begin to suspect I might be…


No but you don’t get the new features of the next version. So it’s really not an apples to apples comparison


Can you use Final Cut Pro 7 today?


[deleted]


The Air’s size is pretty perfect. The only time I wish it was bigger is drawing on procreate.


I guess it’s what you want an iPad for.

I wanted to like external display + stage manager on iPad, but I’d have a hard time recommending somebody spend an extra couple hundred dollars so they can use those features.

But you’re right, there’s no telling what comes to the iPad in the future, but anything cool is probably not going to be on anything lower than M1


i really enjoy my iPad 5th gen. The external display tools are really convenient. I use it for school so the battery life is also pretty nice, although not the best in the world.


> I wouldn't recommend people buy a pre-M1 iPad Air or Pro at this point.

The benefits of an older pro over a 5th gen iPad are huge though


Yeah I think that is the common thing with most iPads they are so solid for a long time. I know people have always complained about the software not using the capability of the chips. But what it does is let them get updates for a long time because they can still run with no issues.


Mines chronically underutilise and more of a glorified consumption device.  I got it in 2021 second hand for $500 though so I don’t feel too bad.


It’s my least used apple device.  I have a mbp14 for more serious work along with a custom pc paired with a 38 and 24” for wfh.


I remember this reasoning being a critique of the movie Minority Report. If a detective were to find incriminating footage by having to hold their hands in front of their bodies for hours every day, it is a complete no-go. For anything upto a few minutes is probably fine, before you get fagged out.


If the technology is good enough it can track your fingers even with your arms down at your side, which would be way more comfortable.


Looks like Purdue tried it in 2017 and came to the same conclusions. https://phys.org/news/2017-05-gorilla-arm-fatigue-mid-air-usage.html

They often are as has been proven time and time again (and again in this case)


Fav was the *Apple Glasses Steve Jobs Heritage Edition* lol


Live 11 Suite costs $749.  That is like 14 years of this subscription.


Logic added an Ableton-like loops interface several years back FYI


Yeah, the more I learn Live the more I'm finding workflows more efficient as its interface starts to "click", especially when it comes to live loops which particularly appeals to me as a DJ.


Live is good for electronic stuff and performances. I'd say it's more of a direct competitor to fl studio, while logic is more along the lines of pro tools and cubase.


I’m alluding to a concern about Logic on **macOS** possibly moving to subscription model (the comments I was initially replying to add context).  I agree Logic as-is on macOS is a tremendous value and I’m not necessarily looking to drop it.  I am, however, choosing to broaden my skillset and keep my options open in case that value I find in Logic degrades with a change in its licensing model.


I believe it’s this one:

`mv -v ~/Library/Application\ Support/.ffuserdata ~/.Trash`


Motion is still alive and well. The latest release is 5.6.3, which came out in October. The UI has been modernized since FCS, but the feature set is still the same. In fact, heaps of the old FCS-era Motion content files are still available in Motion 5.6 to this today.

u/iMacmatician may be referring to either LiveType (titling software that came with FCE) or the other apps that came bundled in Final Cut Studio, like Soundtrack Pro, Color and Cinema Tools.


Crap, I confused it with Shake. 

(I think I confused those two because there was [a rumor](https://www.macrumors.com/2006/06/21/end-of-shake-phenomenon-in-2008/) that Shake would get a successor codenamed "Phenomenon" based on Motion.)


Yep exactly. I get the feeling there are a lot of ‘lone shark creators’ in here who aren’t passing off creative assets around in an environment where time is money.  Getting assets from A to B in a streamlined way between apps is the only way


Yes. Final Cut Pro massively improved in even just its first couple of years.


That’s surprising, but nice to hear!


Subscription model isn’t always a rip off, though. Sure, it’s frequently more expensive than standalone applications but it does have its upsides and scenarios where the value received by the customer is equal to standalone purchases.


see personally I’d never buy FCP for 150$ cause i’m not a professional making money from the editing. 5$ a month though? i can afford that, and i’m not making videos that will get me paid anyway.


You’re confused. I didn’t say anything about not liking subscriptions.


Yeah Logic Remote is pretty huge! What a dream combo


Of course we do. There will always be something someone doesn’t like, people like to complain and voice there opinions. People have been asking for logic on iPad for years and people are already freaking out and talking shit that’s wrong and it’s not even out yet lol. I for one can’t wait


Yeah it doesn’t sound like much but going from 11-12.9” screen is a big difference. I went from the bigger screen to smaller and I always noticed it and didn’t like it. Felt like having a really portable flat screen tv with the 12.9


The 12.9 inch ipad being so big is actually a negative to me. Its like holding a giant slab. I like my 11 in Pro. Feels like the perfect size that allowed me to watch stuff easily but also use it for minor productivity stuff like taking notes


My iPad was my main device when I had a shitty phone and laptop.
 When I upgraded my laptop I moved all my pro stuff to my MacBook (even photo editing - where the Apple Pencil makes a big difference). It became a YouTube & reddit machine 

After upgrading to a phone with a better screen & battery life, I stopped using the iPad completely. My phone can show hours of YouTube and it's so much easier to pull a phone out of your pocket than to carry a bag with an iPad in it. 

It's now become an overpriced external monitor & document scanner for my macbook


[deleted]


Holy shit I can’t believe I forgot about this one


Live has been better than Logic for over a decade. I had both in the mid 2000s and used them both a lot...and then settled on Live because it was better. I've gone back to Logic just to try and learn it better...but Ableton is still better.


$300 is 5 years of $5/m

$800 (for live) would get you over 13 years of Logic at $5/m.

What’s the problem?


Definitely try different DAWs. Live does things perfectly that Logic does poorly with too much complexity. I love both.


It’s also complicated because FCPX was originally introduced with a very limited feature set that was ridiculed by everyone. I think part of the reason Apple hasn’t ever charged an upgrade price is simply because they do have some shame from releasing such a failure of a product.


If the value is equal then why would I want a subscription lol, just let me buy a license


Having the 12.9" on the road is a life saver with Sidecar. Editing and  having access to a 2nd screen of that color quality is expensive on the PC side as a monitor alone. But to have that screen for Lightroom with a fast turn around needed some sample photos, also doesn't hurt for Netflix on flights.

Gotcha.


What phone did you have before and what about now?


I’m on a nearly 5yr old xs max I’ve had since release :) I got the battery changed over December and it’s a great phone :)


Lower barrier to entry, always on the latest version.

Not to mention that expensive apps can be hard sell on iPad. Especially since it’s not exclusively catering to the pro market; with these apps being more likely to appeal to less experienced users looking to break in.

Subscription models can be predatory but they’re not all bad. They do have their place.


Oh yea I love how much easier going to class was once I switched to using an iPad instead of actual pen and paper. No more accidentally forgetting to put a certain notebook back into my bag, being able to snap a photo of a whiteboard or projection and add them to my notes to make them better, being able to search specific text from my notes, etc

Which notes app do you use? Before I finished school I used Notability


My previous was a Huawei P20 lite. My current is the Samsung Galaxy A54.
iPhones are hilariously expensive here in South Africa. For the same price as My A54 I'd only get a XS 256gb or a used 64gb 11.

I'd love to get the full apple ecosystem but I feel like I'm being ripped off paying so much for a 5 year old phone


The iPad hardware is so far ahead of the software that there’s no point in releasing new models. More power under the hood is pointless when it’s not going to be used.

Seems like 2023 will be a somewhat quiet year for apple


The operating systems really need to be better… I’d rather get meaningful QoL updates to IOS and iPadOS for the devices I already own so I can continue caring about their products.


I would love for Beats to get updated to the Pro 2’s chip. I want a cheaper alternative to the Maxes.


I wonder if this was a decision regarding the economy right now, and when that decision was actually made. We all know the design cycle takes a couple years - did the plan out this pause or did they just decide it recently?


You know what that means: New colors! 

Hopefully we can get Space Black stainless steel again without the absurd Hermés upcharge.


AirPods Max needs USB-C


How about small updates, AV1 support?


This just in: we have no news.


Maybe they need to take a year back and focus on software quality again anyway.


these annual upgrades were a thing once tech companies realized they could start upselling people constantly. they're hardly \*needed\* upgrades for most cases. 

the iPad especially is just weird because they gave it a desktop-class chip, with no desktop-class functionality. i dont get upgrading this thing from m1 at all if they're going to keep it as just a big iphone with macbook hardware. apple's insistence that they know best with their software to the point of a stranglehold keeps their devices from being as powerful as they can be. 

apple tv in its latest form is really, really good. super high quality 4k remuxes loaded across my home network will start instantly. given that 8k is still far out from being useful, their major upgrade here would be internals if they wanted to turn the apple tv into an apple arcade console for higher quality games.


* Ipad pro are rumoured to be jumping to a huge upgrade: dual-oled stacked panel in 2024 + new SoC
* Apple TV, frankly unless we have a new type with a homepod + apple TV, the current apple tv is a powerhouse and more than capable of handling 4K and HDR..and apple arcade.
* Apple watch, they need to add new innovative sensors but those things take years of validation and certification

The only viable thing would be an airpod max upgrade: USB-C, Apple H2, revamped design for more compact "standby" form, better design to fight condensation, lighter etc.


Honestly, fine with me. Putting out a device every single year only ensures that the improvements between each model become more and more granular as the technology slows down. If you want people to be excited about your thing, you gotta have a little bit of time in between releases, in my opinion

Obviously, the Apple Watch and the iPhone at the very least are going to have new models in 2023, and this report is just referring to internal improvements in those models, but I would honestly be fine with them skipping years altogether when nothing exciting was going to happen anyhow


I just want to game on my mac… is that too much to ask? Why can’t Apple Arcade have more than just silly mobile games?


AirPods: just had multiple refreshes

Apple Watch: probably just means the Series 9 will be up this year but with only minor updates and tweaks.

iPad: what’s the point? It’s already overpowered for what it can do.

AppleTV: also just got a refresh.


what about Qi2?


I want my iPad to be waterproof.

Why you might ask? Same reason they make a kindle waterproof.

I like to take baths and watch my shows.


The regular updates and “leaks” seem to have paradoxically hurt sales.  Rather than just buying new every few year cycles, consumers have gotten wise and decided to wait it out to see what the next model brings.


Apple Watch Ultra aside, it feels like that and Apple TV haven't had a major update in years.


Hopefully that means major changes for the iPhone  Pro


New AirPods Max would be nice… it has been over 2 years since the OG’s came out.


[deleted]


Cool. Then don't release new devices. Do it every other year. How often do we see articles about over use of resources and over population and it's going to get worse. But yet we keep putting out new products every year. If you don't have a major update then don't release. On top of not making products that last. Everything is just going to get worse. And the same people who complain about over use of resources want a new phone, watch, pad,etc.., every year.


[deleted]


I agree with much of what’s been said already. I’d rather wait a little longer for a product update that wows versus like, a minuscule camera improvement. That said, they release new iPads every 2 minutes and that specifically has become more annoying than appealing.

Nonetheless, I thought to mention that maybe they want to expend effort and energy on AR stuff. And their recently reinvigorated car efforts? Not sure but all in all, I’m cool with it.


We need usb-c AirPods


So glad iPhone wasn’t mentioned seeing at the 14 Pro wasn’t a big improvement over the 13 Pro to me at least.


Lazy garbage. Apple Watch S8 was the same thing as the S7 which was the same thing as the S6 outside of the slightly bigger screen.


I’m hoping for another Apple TV update where they don’t decode the audio and pass as PCM bitstream. I don’t know if that can be changed at hardware or just software though.


I just want a refreshed mac mini so get 24gb ram with the m2 and the m1 is limited to 16gb. Come on apple !


Apple can not get away with yet another year where the standard Apple Watch has few new improvements. The competition is starting to catch up now - I imagine Pixel Watch will be better on their second attempt - and they can't sit on their lead forever.


Cries in too much disposable income


I’m curious what their selling point will be for the next iPhone.

Edit ok so why would I get downvoted for asking this?


If there’s no point why do it? Minor updates are fine


they have reached their potential


Why doesn’t Apple offer product red iPhone in the pro and pro max option?


Sometimes products are ok the way they are.


Still rocking a Series 4 watch. All I really want is 5G on a watch then I’ll upgrade


Just sitting over here waiting on an MacBook Pro 16" M2 to be released...


I would gather that is has something to do with the the fact that they have lost 50% of their manufacturing capabilities in China


Excellent. Can we get an updated Mac Mini then please??


I’m okay with almost all of that, but I’m not going to lie new AirPods Max that brings forth the upgrades from the latest AirPods Pro 2, compatibility with Lossless audio, and maybe some cool touch functionality, would be great.


Probably waiting for Foxconn to build more factories outside of China and for all the related Taiwanese suppliers to move with them as well. iPhone and Macs need prioritization.


They’re definitely counting on their VR/AR set then. That or they’re screwed


HomePod plz


Series 7 looking better and better


For Apple Watch they are probably holding back for Apple Watch X


Only thing that can make me upgrade my ipad is an OLED version.


I think most of the hardware exceeds the software at this point.  The operating systems really need some bug fixing and UX improvements to take advantage of the hardware.  I would like to see the rest of the Mac lineup brought up to the M2+ chipsets thought.  I want to buy a MacBook Pro and it's weird seeing it's on the M1 still while the air is on the M2.


Hopefully they take this year to catch the software up to the hardware. Especially with the iPad.


Just expand the iPadOS features. The hardware is capable enough.


iPad and Apple Watch haven’t had a big update in about 5 years.


What a coincidince, me neither.


phones these days shouldn't be released annually too.. they're just like TVs and monitors now.  the tech has plateaued pretty much.


Apple Watch only needs a blood glucose monitor and it would be perfect. Hoping Apple can finally crack that but after 10 years of research.


Here’s a major update they could do: 

Modular phones. So we can hot swap to the new awesome terrapixel cameras or whatever without having to buy a whole new phone. 

That’d be innovative, Apple! Get on it.


Good.  I’d like to see a 2 year product release cycle.  

Hardware and software.


Good. Those products are fine and don’t need yearly updates.


Lol there’s been no major updates since the legend Steve Jobs died. Been same shit different year


So the Apple Watch will have no real updates in 3 years.


Just looking for a iPhone with usbc please


Good. Now Apple should focus on making their software more reliable. Jesus.


It's disappointing people expect and want to buy new products every year. Wasteful consumerism.


Keep buying the same shit, at higher prices. 

The shine is going to wear off apple and they’ll never get it back. It’s just taking forever because they’re so big.


[deleted]


Back in the day we had to wait years for updates and leaks were nearly non existent, so we're back to the norm.


Apple Watch could use some more exciting updates; it’s a fashion item and its design stayed largely the same for almost a decade. There should have been a round/flat/whatever variant years ago.

Ultra doesn’t count, most people cannot make that their daily driver (or at least that’s what I assume based on the size and weight, I’d like to be wrong though).


Good we need to get away from this cycle there is no point anymore


Just give me an iPad with an even bigger screen. And preferably it should not be from the "Pro" line. And I don't care about the rest of the updates.


They’d legit make record sales of the iPad in 2023 if they simply enabled macOS on the iPad.


i’d love regular airpods with swiping for volume control though, hope that qualifies as no major update


thank god


I, planning no Apple purchase/upgrades whatsoever in 2023-2024


honestly the only thing  i want on ipad/iphone is something like samsung dex, connect your ipad to a monitor and boom it turns into a mac.


Been holding out with my Series 3 for a new design. This was the year I was hoping they’d finally switch it up. Fingers crossed. At least give us a black/ space grey color.


Good. Spend more time actually innovating and less time re-releasing the previous year’s leftover product with minor upgrades.


They all had updates in H2 of 2022. No need to update them again without pissing off everyone who bought the late 2022 model.


And thats ok. Yearly releases isnt healthy


Your forgot iPhone getting minimal updates


Good. We don’t need the “annual upgrade no matter what” thing. Now if only they could apply that principle to the software side…


A software upgrade for iPhone 13 Pro Max to get dynamic island.


So the Apple Watch Series 9 will be the same as the Series 8, which was the same as the Series 7, which was just a Series 6 with a bigger screen.

I know Apple Watches don't need a super powerful chip, but keeping the exact same chip for 4 generations feels wrong.


This proves Apple has run out of ideas and has nothing to offer.


Possible M3 MacBook Pro?🤞🏻


Really taking it easy lol. Don’t release new products if they aren’t big updates.


Can’t get over the fact how far behind Apple is with their Apple TV in comparison to google tv…


Good! If anything they should plan sunsetting all these options sizes colors etc. keep it simple Tim Apple


How is this “reportedly”? I thought this was backed by official information. Thanks for nothing, Macrumors.


No need to wait everyone, i looked in the crystal ball and I can fill you in, ready?

“This just in— all of Apples incredible amazing updates for 2023 will consist of releasing 3 new colors for all products. AND— the iPhone won’t change shape, it will be given another f’n useless camera. IT’s unbelievable!!”


Good, these products absolutely do not need yearly releases.


The Apple AR/VR headset looks like it will be hot to wear. And that I will look like an idiot while wearing it. Admittedly I look like an idiot anyway but I certainly don’t need to accentuate this.


too bad.  ipad mini needs 120hz and more ram.


Good. Stop consumerism.


Need to save all their money to buy Lucid at the market bottom in September/October.


With the exception of new product launches pretty much what Apple has been doing since like the iPhone 4?


Why they release same phones watches and iPads every year?  I can’t tell What’s different between iPhone 13 and 14. Heck even 12 works & looks same as 14 . Watch too there is almost nothing new  from AW 6,7 to 8. Yeah there should be some difference but it’s so incremental  that no one can tell unless they go to the website to check the spec sheet. 

iPad pro 2018 is 98% same as this new M2 iPad pro except for the chip and Price But then iPad pro 2018 get its job done just as fast and fine. Literally no reasons to pay 1k for a phone and pad that is 1sec faster than what you got 3years ago 

Why don’t we have 1phone 1 iPad and 1watch every 3years so that when i upgrade , it’s actually an upgrade and less E-wastes so good for the environment too if apple cares about it as they say


That's fine by me... The only annoying thing would be if Apple decides to USB-C on the iPhones this year, it would be dumb for the airpods to still use lightning.


Of course not. They’re screwed because they doubled down on China.


The display tech of the 11” Pro could use some upgrades, but it sounds like that won’t come until OLED is sorted out in 2024.


There’s more to the hardware than the processor though, the displays could clearly get an update


I would love for them to increase the stability of Sidecar because I found it’s a feature I end up using a lot more than I expected.


I dream of a day when I plug in my m1 iPad I can use full OSX, then I unplug it and I have iPad OS.


My 2018 iPad Pro feels like it’s ahead of its time


[deleted]


I am disappointed with my iPad Pro 12.9" w/ a M2 for this reason.

I didn't think it was going to be...so...iPaddy.  I had higher expectations.

Owned it 2 weeks and it has a significant battery drain issue.   50% in like 5 hours sitting on the chair not being used.


I’d love me some oled mini.


Wouldn’t make it stronger last longer? If it has a better chip it can run using less power and thus end up having more battery, no?


This. I’m actually moving away from the iPad because of the software. Recently got a Surface Pro and it’s amazing. I just wish it had the hardware of the M1…


More power under the hood and how iPadOS functions are two totally separate issues


More power under the hood can always be utilised by high end apps


There is. Screen size. I need an even bigger screen. I don't care about the rest of the features.


I don't even know what they would do with Apple TV. The hardware is feature complete.


The advantage of frequent minor updates is that people can buy the product at any time and get one that is not much worse than the average in terms of dated technology or value for money.

Infrequent updates are good if you buy the product right after its release, but two or three years later it becomes a bad deal. The Mac Pro is an example, even before the cylinder. I think that Apple should have released a minor Mac Pro update in 2021 with Ice lake CPUs and an upgraded base GPU to tide us over before Apple Silicon. Instead, the Mac Pro hasn't been upgraded since 2019 (except for BTO GPU options) and is currently a horrible value, arguably worse than the cylinder ever was unless you want expandability or high-end graphics.


[deleted]


I think the updates should be spaced further apart. I’m ok with this. Their product line is pretty good. Longer gaps between may mean better updates too instead of constantly meeting an arbitrary deadline.


Sure there is. The people with FOMO will always buy the newest model. Apple knows this.


I disagree. Updates on a regular cadence is what the entire tech industry has been about since Apple's founding. If the Apple S9 SoC for the AW is another design built around  TSMC N7P 1.8 GHz Dual-core Thunder that would be seriously disappointing. Only having a single upgrade since the Series 4 is stagnation. That would be like going from the A12 in the iPhone XR, to a variant of the A13 in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 pro.


i completely agree. it would help their environmental cred a lot if they just committed to releasing a new product every 3-5 years or whatever it takes to actually make meaningful changes to the hardware.


I also saw an article that they’re scaling back plans for the next versions of iOS and macOS as well. 

Sounds like they’re focusing 80% on the new AR/VR headset this year and ignoring most everything else to get that done


It’s gonna be an iPhone year. We haven’t had a redesign since iPhone 12 and based on their 3 year cycle I’m betting it’s gonna be a big one


I’m going opposite. Like they roll out some crazy secret product that blows everyone’s minds. Haha. We can hope


iPhones get USB-C this year and side-loading. Big year for iPhones.


-	Update every device to USB-C
-	Reality headset and xrOS
-	Long rumored improvements to Siri


sad


Seriously! Ever since Tim apple took over, apple has gotten so fixated on making the best hardware, and they honestly have. But like so many people point out in this thread, all the hardware perks mean nothing when macOS can’t game and iPad OS just gives you a M2 powered iPhone. 

They are the ONLY company on the market with a desktop class SOC in a tablet that doesn’t run desktop class OS and it makes ZERO sense


Ugh I’ve been wanting an update to the Beats Studio for the longest time. Can’t we just get an over ear option with Spatial Audio, Transparency, and better ANC that isn’t a $500 AirPods Max?


Apple TV and AirPods don’t usually get annual upgrades. Apple Watch will likely get a minor upgrade (headline says no “major” updates). This isn’t that odd since this year apple is rumored to be announcing some major updates to other products: VR headset and many Mac updates for example


you may have gone too far ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `


Likely has to do with China dealing with Covid causing disruptions in manufacturing. Also, the politics of working with China as tensions with Taiwan increase over time.


Also, when’s the last time these updates made a noticeable difference to most people? 

I’d rather be able to find a phone with a fucking aux jack than have some overblown, inconvenient minor changes every year


Ceramic edition series 8 please


.


I am once again asking them to match all of their product lines to the iMac colors. I would ball out with orange everything.


Make the iPhone 1/4 inch smaller. The innovation is just astounding


Not gonna lie, would be happy if there was a Product Red variant of an iPad or a MacBook.


And a power button.


It needs a major update. Noise cancelling is worse now, it needs the updated chip from the APP2. Too heavy, trim some weight. Lightening needs to go, USB-C all the way.


It needs lossless audio


AirPods Max needs a total design overhaul. It's a absolute waste of money because of the design flaw that produces condensation behind the ear cushions due to the natural heat of your body. The bacteria and mould that produces inside the ear cushion is a health hazard, and the fact that the liquid gradually seeps into the circuits, frying the whole device - but usually the Bluetooth first - means that it shouldn't have been allowed to go on sale.

I got a bacterial AND fungal infection in my ear canal due to it; had to get my ears cleaned and was put on some fancy prescription omni-cidal ear drops to deal with it.

I now own a pair of XM4s, which feel extremely cheap to the touch, sound worse, has a fake happy robot lady that interrupts your listening experience for every little thing, and are incredibly fidgety with its controls that I had to turn half the features off just to not go insane. But at least it doesn't try to kill itself and damage my health in the process.

If I could get a pair of AirPods Max without the catastrophic design flaws, I would buy it in a heartbeat. Because otherwise, it really was the best consumer-grade bluetooth headphones on the market.


I'd love to be able to wear those. But with the fact that they don't fit larger heads, and they squeeze like a vise...not really tempting until something changes.


They don’t use USB C? What lmao


As do the AirPods and AirPods Pro


Why?


Being a codec, it could probably be added in software for now. M1/M2s certainly have the muscle for it.


no news at 11


Apple has different departments, and the software engineering org can work on software quality while the hardware engineering org can do their own thing. Not like the hardware engineering org has to take the year off.


bro I just want walkie talkie to work again on my Apple Watch. it was so nice to have going to the store with my girlfriend.


Just buy one when you need one. They shouldnt slow down improvements.


MagSafe is Qi2 I think I could be misunderstanding though.


We know what you're doing in there


Ive been a yearly upgrader on the iPhone since the 6 came out, but this was the first year I skipped because I felt like the iPhone 13 Pro and the 14 Pro were too similar.


Imo the watch doesn’t have any update-worthy features ever since the Series 5 with ECG/Always on display.

6 added blood oxygen tracking, which is not even medically accurate.

7 added a slightly bigger screen.

8 added crash detection and a “thermometer”.

Unless you got spare money and/or find a good deal, there’s (again, imo) no reason to upgrade other than faster charging and brighter screen.


I'm holding out for the Glucose monitor, whether that be AW12 or AWU4


I mean they they redesigned it just in 2021. AW so far has a 3 year redesign cycle so I’m betting 2024 is the redesign


If it feels like it, your judgement must be severely impaired.


airpods max desperately needs a second gen to fix its first gen woes, i just hope apple doesn’t scrap it like they did the homepod


incremental updates are fine, look at how car manufacturers do it. major refreshes every several years, but there are often minor improvements between model years. as smartphone tech continues to mature, that makes more and more sense.

have you considered just not buying a new phone if you don’t need it?


Glad someone finally said it lol.  I was expecting everyone to be like "oh, they're actually being honest for once" but everyone's acting gaslit af.


If I’m not mistaken, the iPhone is like 50% of their revenues or something. A new one every year is a pretty sure bet.


I went from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 14 pro. It was like looking into the future. I used the new phone for a few minutes, then went to check something on the 8 and wondered how I used it for so long.


Definitely due for a CPU upgrade with the Apple Watch at least. It’s still running on 7nm.


Yeah but they also released the Ultra at the same time with some really unique upgrades/changes.


Still rocking my S5 and I see no reason to upgrade. Always-On Display was what got me to upgrade from the S4, a feature which I consider essential on a watch.


Can confirm.  Finally got an Apple Watch a couple weeks ago and picked up a used S7 after doing lots of research on all the latest watches.  Can’t imagine needing anything else other than heart rate monitoring, fitness tracking, playing Spotify on runs and checking message/email notifications from time to time. I don’t even use always on display because I like to check notifications on my own terms.


Better camera zoom because of the periscope, USB-C, maybe remove the pill for all screen display?


I have a feeling 5G on a watch would be awful for battery life


Why would you even need 5G on a watch? You’re not gonna be streaming 4K videos or downloading large files on it.


What do you expect to get from 5G in the Apple Watch?


I was still wearing my original stainless steel with Milanese loop until the battery swelled up last summer.


What do you want 5G on your AW for?


Bluetooth doesn’t support lossless. You need cables for that.


glad I picked one up at a very nice price after the series 8 is out


iPhone X would like to disagree. It completely changed how we saw iPhone. It got rid of the home button, and the entire front of the phone was screen, except for the notch, it also changed the aluminum edges to stainless steel, just like the iPhone 4.


I use the Beats Fit Pro in the SKIMs color that matches my skin tone. Works exactly like AP but blend in better. Although the ANC is slightly worse.


How would new colours solve this?


ultra is fine tbh… its surprisingly comfortable


I have the pros and this feature works very very poorly.


Capital (G). :)


Sorta like keeping the Series 3 in production so long that both Moses and Jesus wore them and Apple was still selling them new the whole time.


That’s not how companies work.


What is behind?  I have never used google tv


I’d take it but it’s still a really nice display


It’s a shame the 11” never got an updated screen. I had the 12.9” 2018 and I just found it was too big.


I want the 11" Pro so bad but the display just looks so terrible in comparison to most other modern portable devices.  I was crushed when it didn't get updated this year as I had been waiting.  I can't go from the beautiful OLED on my iPhone to the iPad without it feeling jarring every time.  Especially when the 13" looks so vibrant and colorful right next to it, really night and day especially in brighter settings.  At the same time the 13" is just a little too big and unwieldy for how I like to use the iPad.


Oled will never be sorted out. It’s a deeply flawed technology with a very short usable life due to burn in.   MicroLed is the future. We finally have it on a commercial product with that 110” tv that was just unveiled at CES. Its only a matter of time until MicroLed is the most common screen type.


Yeah it's flaky on wifi, but great when wired.


I would love to use it but since my iPad has my private Apple ID and the MacBook has my work Apple ID, I can’t. Thanks, Tim Apple.


This is the one. I use it often but don’t think I’ve had a day yet where I don’t have to reconnect every 30 minutes.


They don't want to do that because they want you to buy an iPad and a MacBook


If they do that, I’ll stay in the Apple ecosystem. Otherwise, it’s back to Microsoft for me once my MBP 2021 craps out.


Same. 

Even though I want a new one, I can’t think of a single reason to upgrade that would justify the cost. 

Shit works like magic.


As an android fan, one if the very few things I envy about iOS.
Even the latest samsung tab s8 has ways to go


Same - apart from the display not being mini-LED.


[deleted]


Especially with the lightning charger ridiculousness. You can’t charge the pencil with the iPad because it’s on USB-C instead of lightning now. Also, the USB-C connector uses a *USB 2.0* bus!!!


I mean m1/m2 still doesn't change the fact that its still running ipadOS.

I haven't used an ipad regularly in ages (basically only had the 1st gen ipad) but my wife has the latest mini. I was in a pinch and was going to travel on a flight and wanted to throw some movies to watch. Thought that since it has a usb-c port now and I own a usb-c pendrive, it would be sooooo easy to just put a movie on the drive and go. 

The number of walls I hit was unreal, files app is slow to access large files, it doesn't open the movie in the apple tv app (you have to sync it the traditional way), instead files app opens its own video player, it barely supports any common video formats and third party apps can't access the attached mass media. It was unreal how bad it was. At the end of the day I said i'll just take my macbook with me.


Pro Mini would be nice.


depends what you are looking for. My Surface pro's face recognition login worked for a few weeks, then stopped working, and I didn't get plastic surgery. It lags every time screen orientation changes. the entire OS is built for keyboard and mouse the touchscreen interface is an after thought. The software keyboard takes up way too much space. Basically it's not a tablet.


There’s no apps seriously pushing that hardware. The limitations of the OS also restricts high end apps from existing in the first place, as it doesn’t make for an efficient professional workflow.


Surely if the screen gets much bigger it’s going to lose its portability?


Find my remote?


TrueHD Audio and Passthrough Audio sure would be nice! nVidia does it with the Shield. I’m sure Apple can too.


Just off the top of my head:

* Far-field microphone array so we can use 'Hey Siri' without the remote.

* Integration with Philips Hue to enable Ambilight without needing a sync box or Philips TV.

* Wireless charging for the remote using a MagSafe pad on the top of the device.

* Find My support for the remote along with some capacitive button on the Apple TV itself.

* Proper widget support to allow for it to function as a smart noticeboard (group calendar, notes, emails, Home status).


DTS support maybe


How about let me watch the movies I paid for without an internet connection?


Maybe I’m dumb and I didn’t figure these things out (I got Apple TV for Christmas so I’m still discovering it) but there’s a couple of things I would really want to be added:

-Switching profile should actually work like a real profile imo. If my wife switches to her profile I think she should be able to have her own apps, it should use her own accounts or profiles on the apps where it’s possible, she should be able to see her own photo library, play her own game saves, etc… I was a bit disappointed to see that in the end outside of a name in the top corner it makes no big difference

-Send pictures from the Apple TV would be cool too. Sometimes we look at pictures or videos and someone says “can you send it to me?” and I wish I didn’t have to reach for another device to do it. It’s a detail but during Christmas this happened a bunch of times and when I enter the living room I leave my phone at the entrance because I don’t want to pollute a social moment, a movie, a game or whatever so having to constantly get back to my phone/tablet/computer was a bit jarring.

-Files app. I’d like to be able to drop a movie in there, or a design my designer sent me and look at it on my big screen for example.

These are only a couple of the top of my head, I know I had more but can’t remember at the moment but while I think Apple TV is great, it could definitely use some more work


IMO using the latest chipset couldn’t hurt for gaming. Now that you can hook up an Xbox controller to the TV, it could function as a game console also


FaceTime support with an optional camera module.


8K


There was a rumor hardware upgrade that would include a FaceTime camera and front speaker bar built in. I think that would be awesome for family calls using tv and a camera that can sit on your tv stand or integrated into the sound bar.


A Home app is conspicuous by it’s absence especially considering the Apple TV acts as a HomeKit hub and is also capable of receiving and displaying HomeKit notifications.


[deleted]


Idk, it’d be nice to hook up an antenna. A nice TV app with local guide overlay like Xbox used to do. That’d be cool


they could, you know, make an actual TV


I feel like they could jazz up the OS a bit. It’s been the same forever. The setting menu I don’t think has ever changed.


Make it cheaper.

>There is already a popular narrative that Apple products are instantly obsolete because everyone is already talking about the next model basically as soon as review embargoes lift on the new model. 

Infrequent updates will just shift the narrative to the current model being obsolete because it's been in the lineup for a few years. (Example: The Mac Pro.)


Aka, me. 😩😖

Apple hasn't cared about major SoC upgrades for the Watch because frankly SoC performance doesn't really matter as long as it can handle the UI well enough and provide good enough battery life. No one's doing anything that demands high performance on the Watch. The Watch's function is fitness tracking/health monitoring and showing glanceable info. Features like better displays and more health sensors are far more important.


Reliable reports today indicate the opposite, no major updates to either physical hardware or iOS with a focus instead on AR/VR headset launching in the fall.


I think the Dynamic Island was the big one


USBC and fast transfer rates will be big enough


They’re supposed to release their AR/VR headset in spring, according to reliable leakers


A next gen Console, runs on 2 M2 Ultras, and it’s the only other console to play Nintendo games.


I just want a fit band. I don't want to wear an apple watch with my mechanical watch. Apple, please!


You’re right.  iPadOS has to get more like macOS.  However, Apple seems to have got that backwards lately.


AirPods Max are two years old now, aren’t they? I’d expect to get a second gen of them.


That’s a great point, thanks!


>Apple Watch will likely get a minor upgrade (headline says no “major” updates).

New Watch band options perhaps


Major iphone updates hopefully


It's time for the return of [the Blue Dalmatian and Flower Power decoration schemes](https://www.cultofmac.com/468313/flower-power-blue-dalmatian-imac/) for two of the 2001 iMacs. 

P.S. Was I the only one who unironically liked Flower Power?


Yes. At least let me be able to turn the damn thing off and on again.


And a proper case


Wtf seriously? You can't turn them off?


Never really seen the issue with this. I like them just being on when I need to use them


I don't know why people keep talking about how bad the noise canceling is. I use mine while getting treatment. A very loud large room with machines constantly beeping and nurses constantly talking around you. When I turn on noise canceling it's like pressing the mute button. I don't hear anything in the room. Noise canceling on the Max is second only to maybe Sony.


Agreed about the weight. Waaaaay too heavy. They also clamp too tight (which is a side effect of the weight probably). 

People should go put on some Bose Quiet Comfort of Sennheiser HD 600’s. Those are so much more comfortable than the AirPods Max it’s laughable. 

They also need to fix the audio “tunneling” issue which is where you can hear your own heartbeat. They fixed this on AirPods Pro. They need to fix it on AirPods Max. 

I also don’t like that the ear pads are scratchy. 

To be honest I’ve never felt like Apple has been great at ergonomics. They design beautiful devices but when you build a device that has to interface directly with the body you have to compromise beauty for practicality. This makes me concerned for the upcoming AR headset.


This is why you never buy the first generation of any product.


And a built in DAC so you can plug it directly into a MacBook and have it actually work!


I don’t think so. Lossless only matters when you use good wired headphones with good dac and amp. This way you eliminates all the more prominent factors that can affect the sound quality, then with some training, you can maybe hear the difference between mp3, flac and dsd (even with the right setup, you still need to know exactly what you you looking for to appreciate the difference). Codec is the last thing Apple need to improve on the AirPods Max.

Have you tried them? My head is massive and I think they’re the most comfortable headphones I’ve ever worn, and definitely ones I can easily wear the longest uninterrupted. Particularly after having them I find the ear cups on every other wireless noise cancelling headphones way too shallow.


For the same reason all Apple accessories need to move towards USB C charging


Youtube app on tvos actually deliver av1 when possible. This is on second gen 4k. But i doubt anyone want battery power device to have software decoding


Yeah but do M series chips support hardware acceleration for AV1 like they do for x265? I doubt they would add support if it was just a half baked software solution.


Hardware decoders are *much* faster and more energy efficient than software solutions so I don’t see them doing it.


Sure but we all know that Apple will sell it as a hardware upgrade.


Yes they should. Releasing a new model phone every year is so unsustainable, the never ending chip and material shortages is clearly showing us that


As i said, just my opinion. I obviously only buy a new phone when my old one is on its last legs, my only point is that the larger gap in time and technology would drum up more hype than expecting something big every year. Especially in the past few years, the conversation around iPhones has largely revolved around how few improvements there are.


Actually, the fact they release every year can slow down improvements because they need to focus on the release and add some minor improvements instead of going all in on a new tech or major improvement in a 2/3 cycle. The fast you try to go the slower you will go in long term. You also get half features and bad hardware because they don’t have time to ditch and redesign something because in 5 month before the release they need everything finalized. If they have a 2 years cycle this means they can play around for a 1 then build what they really want in 6 month and prepare the mass production in the last 6 month. This also means the software will have more time to adapt and iterate over a hardware that isn’t on production so they can be more agressive on changes and features.


The other way around: Qi 2 implements Apple’s MagSafe, meaning it’ll likely be backwards compatible with it.


If they ever figure out blood pressure monitoring, I will upgrade instantly.


I’m still rocking a Series 4 waiting for glucose monitoring.  At $75 a month for the Freestyle Libre 2 I could pay off the new watch in less than year and be money ahead.


[deleted]


I found a watch on alibaba called the h band that does glucose monitoring. I think it's accurate enough to demonstrate trends but the actual numbers vary notably from meter readings (higher and lower) where I wouldn’t consider the watch to be a replacement for a conventional cgm or meter blood draws. If the Apple Watch was 90% accurate that would be very welcome for me.


I’ve never owned a pair but my eldest daughter is saving up to buy herself some… and she’s almost there.

I’d rather she got new tech rather than 2+ year old stuff.


Do they? Seems like they haven't been popular.


I know one is coming it’s just that I’m hoping for a worthwhile upgrade. We are due for a redesign this year.


Apple need to go back to the Tick Tock release schedule.

Release the iPhone 15, which is a visual and hardware change, then release the iPhone 15S the next year, which is a refinement.

Those who want the next big new and interesting thing can get the Tick cycle of products, and those who want something refined, with theoretically less problems, can get the Tock cycle of products. And those who buy the latest product regardless of what it is will continue doing so.

You can still have your size differences and the Pro model which makes purchasing the regular versions redundant; but it's about being honest with your customers. They're basically doing a Tick Tock cycle, or even a Tick Tock Tock cycle anyway but are calling it a completely new product each time anyway.


I can’t last that long I absolutely love my 13 Pro but if the 15 Pro lives up to what is rumored I’ll be ecstatic. I try to just sell my old phone and buy out the new one so it doesn’t hurt as much.


This was the year's actual "upgrade" 

s6 & s7 are already high performing watches 

s8's really big upgrade is being part of the crash detection feature


They just rolled out dynamic island, the pill is here to stay for the foreseeable future.


The pill they just came out with with dynamic island? Remove they? 🤔


I’d be cool if they gave the option to toggle it off


Coverage. Now that 3G networks have mostly been shut down, LTE is the next one to shut down. And while that's a long ways off, carriers are continually re-farming LTE spectrum for 5G. When that happens, you have more 5G capacity in an area and less LTE capacity for that same area. I have some areas near my home in the more wooded areas where T-Mobile used to drop from 5G to Edge or 3G because they had zero LTE coverage there. Those areas after the shut down are 5G only now (to clarify, they were re-farmed to 5G, so they have 5G instead of no coverage). My watch can't get a signal but my phone can. Heck even my car, which runs on AT&T LTE, isn't doing as hot as it did 2-3 years ago.

I used to be able to go on a hike with just my watch and still have a line of communication. Now I need to bring my phone.

This is a rare use case, IMO. So right now even I don't think the inclusion of 5G in a watch makes sense. But as the spectrum re-farming continues, at some point it is going to make sense for a larger number of people.


Well, there have been rumors for over a year that Apple was working on their own standard that would allow AirPods to work through a Bluetooth-like standard. That’s what I’m hoping for.


I have it and it works great once you get the technique.


Google took content out of the streaming apps and shows them off forefront with rotten tomatoes score… Apple just shows you app icons on you homescreen… and the viewing queue doesn’t include Netflix.


I am not sure if it helps but I have 14 pro and 11” pro ( went to see 12.9” and it was way too big for me to use daily) and I honestly don’t notice the difference with the screens straight away in real time use. I would say give it a try for 2 weeks and return if you still fail the screen is lacking. Otherwise the M2 iPad is simply overpowered.


it doesn’t look terrible at all, cmon lol


The 11” Pro has an amazing screen. My 2018 iPad Pro looks exactly the same as my iPhone 14 Pro except for HDR content.


oled is fine. iphones have had it for a while now. and microled on consumer TVs is still a decade away, phones even longer possibly


OLED is about to change big time with the new quantum dot tech coming out. They use only blue oleds and quantum dots to bring them down to the correct colors.

Micro led in something like a iPad is still many years away


My 4 year old OLED with zero burn in disagrees


I use to say this. Bought an LG Oled 2 years ago and still runs fine. Basically I learned to shut up about saying burnins unless I experienced it. Just giving you a tip also.


This isn’t 2010 lol


This is definitely a L take


I have a years old OLED, play hours and hours of XBOX on it, leave paused bright colors on screen for hours, zero burn in. 6-12 months, I’ve been doing this since 2018.

Actually, the Screen right now has been paused for 1 hour+, zero issues


Would the wired version work then? I can understand why Sidecar over WiFi would not work because you need some form of credentials for it to work. Try using the wire and seeing if that works?


My MacBook Air m1 is a ffing powerhouse of a champ! But man I would love the dream ipad


How so? I bought an S8 because I was sick of waiting for Apple to make iPadOS capable. I think Samsung's tablet UI is better actually...


Pretty sure stage manager includes the 2018 as of iPadOS 16.1


A whole Pro in a mini size is probably an overkill, though.


Oh there’s definitely room for improvement. However I need functionality over ease of use. Apple went too far into ease of use with the iPad that they didn’t include enough functionality for it to be useful other than a media consumption device, and maybe some art stuff.


That’s just silly. 

There are plenty of apps that will peg the M1 or M2 to the limit

For portability, there are models with a smaller screen. Many people mistakenly view the 12.9‑inch iPad as a device to be held in their hands. No, it is a device that is used on a table or stand. [My 12.9-inch iPad](https://sun9-41.userapi.com/impg/XebQ8usfa2HSNGRKy_Xv-hmOWdXgsNxLOxUulw/mfEZnQ14Cxw.jpg?size=1748x2160&quality=96&sign=65dc66143eb79d709bf81316d06013e0&type=album) looks ridiculously small on my sheet music stand.


1000% yes


I’ve settled on getting a sleeve that has an AirTag holder for the remote but to have the Find feature built in would be great! Our couch tends to “eat” our remote.


don’t need a whole new unit for that, just a remote


Am I the only one who hardly gives a damn about and/or uses the remote, and prefers to use my phone to control the ATV (swipe down>control center>ATV remote)?

But also—related—the “quick” find-my-iPhone ping feature on the Apple Watch control center is one of my TOP most used & favorite features/reasons to use an Apple Watch. Literally use it daily. Momentarily losing/misplacing my phone is a thing of the past, thanks to that.


That had that chance and decided not to do it.


Why? Just put it in the same place every time?! How do people lose it so often?

Either its within reach when watching or (in my case) put it in a little remote box on a table in the watching area. 

I mean my box is a woode limited edition dvd box of the wicker man but even my kids and puppy know that the remote goes in the box (or that its off chewing limits). 

Whaddayamean ”find my remote”?!!??


I get why you want it, but there is no service, that streams TrueHD. Also these files is massive, so I really don’t see this feature coming to Apple TV.


TouchID on the remote main button that changes the AppleTV profile based on who’s using the remote.


-	Screen Time support
-	Not annoying the fuck out of me by showing a notification that my remote’s battery is low until I interrupt my movie to go plug it in

This! I would love support for Philips Hue to forgo the need for the Sync Box.

I’d add to this list a dedicated USB-C port so you could physically connect a webcam and use it with FaceTime/Zoom/etc. Paired with support for Center Stage, that would make the Apple TV a must-have smart device in every classroom.


Widget support is a software feature.

The Phillips Hue one might also be... not sure. But Apple would say the answer is for your $smart_whatever to switch to using Matter, not for them to support some proprietary third-party system.

Microphone array and wireless charging pad... sure, but some of us have our appleTVs inside a cabinet and don't see the thing for years at a time. Also I have to charge my remote 3 times a year; might be wasteful to build in all kinds of charging tech that will only be used 15 times over the entire life of the device.

I guess the one I'm strongly onboard with is Find My for the remote, so I can pinpoint find it with the uttrawideband chip in my phone.


Thank you — people have commented that for years like there’s literally nothing else, just because they are content, and *of course* there’s plenty things they can add.


Not sure why they can’t just enable hey siri from your phone to communicate with the Apple TV.


Safari would be amazing too. I know it's niche but there are times that I really want it and screen casting isn't the solution.


Does Apple TV allow you to show slideshows of albums as a background like Google chromecast does? A video version of that would even be nice. I’ve thought it would be cool to put videos of family trips and drone stuff on my screen on repeat while it idles.


that can be achieved through a software update. no need to make a hardware update.


[removed]


None of these are hardware


this will only work if they open up to AAA studios and make it attractive and worth it to develop games for tvOS


Apple x Nintendo. Let Apple do the hardware and Nintendo can focus on games.


8K isn’t going to happen


That would be awesome. I'll be able to stream Xbox Gamepass on it. But I don't think it's gonna happen.


There would be no point… there’s nothing they can do to differentiate it


That’s not hardware.


[deleted]


I think that by upgrading the SoC, not only would it be more performant, which you may be right and it may not need better performance, but it would have better battery life if the SoC was on par with tech used in the A15 or A16 instead of the A13. And improved battery life is something it still needs.


Last year there were some GPU features that failed to ship because of some last-minute bugs, and I would expect those to ship in this year's new A-series chip.

The big one I heard is real time ray tracing, a la Nvidia's RTX.


Yikes.


So nothing really then...


I heard the dynamic island was some last minute decision to have something to present with that wow-factor. They had other things lined up but they weren’t fleshed out in time.


Ooo yeah, nice!


People hate when I say it but apple buying Nintendo makes sense.  The switch 2 on apple silicon would be amazing.


😍


No chance.


Airpod Pros were 3 years old before a second gen came along, my guess is that it could be even longer for the Max since they sell much fewer units.


Yep. December of 2020. The article states that an updated version is **not** expected this year.


I wouldn’t really say the Apple Watch has had a major update since the series 5 except for the ultra. The SE is unlikely to get an update as the original SE was released with the series 6 so that will probably be a 2 year minimum between updates. The ultra is probably going to be like the AirPods Pro and only get an upgrade once’s every 3 years or so. 

The Apple Watch series 9 will likely be the only release this year, it’ll probably have no new sensors and no new screen technology. What they might do is upgrade the CPU inside to the either the 5nm or go right to the 3nm process(as far as I can tell the Apple Watch is still on the 7nm process due to limited manufacturing capacity for 5nm). There would be no noticeable external differences but it may improve battery life, maybe sensor updates to improve power efficiency, these efficiencies wouldn’t have it match the battery life of the ultra but may give a few more hours. If they add a feature and they upgrade the CPU they may add on device Siri(by using the extra space from 5nm to add neural engines). They’ll probably also refresh the colors for the Apple Watch cases.

If the ultra gets an “update” this year they’ll probably just add a new color for the case. 

Watch band options are released seasonally and not limited to apple events unless they’re introducing a new watch band type like a new set of ultra sport style bands.


Slightly better camera and screen as ever.

How long can yearly updates to iPhones be a thing for?


What would that be? Seriously. All these products are beyond mature now and well into gilding the Lily territory.


What are you hoping for?


Lol 😂 yea.. just like how the marketing guy in charge has really come through updating all their other products 😂 


I’m done buying apple for the next decade, innovation = 0. 

You get offered the exact same F’n products in different colors now which come with their own 2 hour keynote. 

Jobs would roll in his grave


Yes. Resetting it several times a day gets old quick.


Ideally, one that doesn’t look like a bra.


Nope.


Same. Coming from the WH-1000XM2 having them work in the same way as the AirPods was a huge selling point for me. Turning my headphones on and off manually feels archaic at best.


There must be something going on, but it’s not happening to mine. I bought my daughter other headphones for Christmas (Bose quiet comfort) because of cost and online reviews. They’re absolute crap. I feel bad about it. 

The noise cancellation on my max are amazing. All I can guess is there’s some sort of part failure or maintenance issue, because clearly there are plenty of people who think they’re defective.


Not saying it’s bad, but the industry has improved since it was launched (you mentioned Sony) and even Apple itself has (APP2 has a significantly upgraded chip and algorithm). Time to bring this to the Max.


Try using a vacuum or in a different environment. I sold mine because I could definitely tell the difference between how it sounded presently and how it sounded when I first got them and there’s definitely a big difference. I didn’t want to believe it


Noice cancellation is weird on Max. It’s very sensitive to head position. Like, I turn my head and the noice cancellation very noticeably changes. There’s only one position where it’s good and it’s weird to have to look for it. I never noticed anything like this with Bose 700, for instance.


Damn that is an awesome use case scenario. Must be quite comforting to be able to zone out like that. Hope your treatment is going well.


Also needs to fold as small as possible


I think perhaps the clamping is subjective. I find them very comfortable and the 600’s tight. My wife thinks the Max are too tight, by my friend does not.


I also agree about the weight. At first I didn’t think it was a big deal, but my headband is pretty worn out despite 2 years of being extremely careful with them. They are so bad they hurt to wear for more than 30 minutes. I’m sure anyone who has used them nearly every day for 2 years like I did are in the same state. 

The headband should be easily and cheap to replace. Officially Apple says it’s not replaceable even though you can pop it off with a SIM card tool.


[deleted]


Agreed, but I made an exception for the Maxes because while they are 1st time over-ear headphones for the AirPod brand they aren't first-time ear phones for the AirPod brand.  In this particular case my dissatisfaction with them are reflection of Apple and not a reflection of being a 1st iteration in a line:

- Proprietary/non-standard connectivity port
- Limited customization (equalizer)
- Little-to-no control over performance modifications (you don't know when they're going to update let alone have the ability to decide when and whether you want updates)

That's all "Apple" and not "first generation".  There's gratefully just good enough audio phone alternatives out there for me which makes these "Apple" compromises easily unacceptable.


Agree, returned it. Not the polished Apple product I expected.


It already has a built in DAC


Ok now we’re talking!


There was a report last year of apple working with Bluetooth on an update for the protocol to support higher bandwidth. Read: lossless. Wireless and lossless would be a huge deal to many of us. 

Im not going to argue about if Id be able to hear the diff, I don’t have AirPods at the moment and have switched to wired for all of my listening unless I’m traveling for work. I can easily hear the difference with varying setups and tested with quality settings when plugged in to verify it myself as well as looking at the spectrum.  

I’d even bet a lot more people can tell the diff than you might give credit for. 

Plus it’s another thing for apple to brag about that nobody else could until they’d be too late to the punch


You just have to google: "AirPods Max condensation" to see how niche it really isn't.

Condensation affects every single AirPods Max; that's what makes it a design flaw. Wear them for an hour and them remove the cushions and see for yourself. Eventually the condensation will destroy the internals of every AirPods Max that is used.

But if you just want to bootlick the most successful company in the world, then by all means.


Ok, why?


i feel like having smaller updates every year would lead to people spreading out their purchases more, which would smooth out the supply chain compared to everyone buying a new phone all at once every several years.


It’s not unsustainable. But there’s no requirements to have massive improvements every year


I’m sure apple has multiple teams working 1-4 phones ahead at any given time


[deleted]


They would be if it weren't for the condensation corrosion and headband fabric deformation issues, lack of USB-C charging, lack of an off button, nonsensical case and noticeably heavier fit compared to plastic headphones (although to be fair that one's more down to personal preference) etc.

For something that costs more than double the price of the Pros, the least Apple could do for its appeal is to ensure that they're reliable.


[deleted]


What’s so great about the 15 pro?


That’s like Siri being the main upgrade feature of the iPhone 4s. S8 is a weird release.


It’s not that easy. 5G modems have more complex circuity and draw more power and take more space.


5G still kills battery life on a phone, and brings very little speed benefits in pretty much all real world deployments unless you're using mmwave, which the watch would definitely not have. 

Even without the insane battery drain, the watch has zero practical use for 5G, you will be waiting a while I think.


Yeah LTE will be around another decade or more.


We’ll see it when it happens. It doesn’t seem likely to me as they released lossless music without anything that can play it and now several AirPods released after that fact.
You won’t hear a difference anyway.


What if you don’t care about rotten tomatoes score?


Viewing queue doesn't include Netflix on any platform, not just Apple TV. It's a "design choice" on Netflix's end


Apart from Netflix integration, that sounds a lot like the Apple TV app.


for once I prefer apples method, I hate android tv interface with passion and its just one giant ad with hardly any functionality.


Except the meh contrast and the blacks are grey.


Age is irrelevant without usage. An OLED tv used for movies once a day will likely never suffer burn in. But use it 8 hrs a day for a PC and it will have it within 6-12 months.


I mean, a TV usually has content that is always moving around so burn in is minimal, with phones and tablets you have elements that are always in the same spot so burn-in is more common


2 years is nothing. I run my iPad Pro all day every day for 2 years with static elements on screen and max brightness. No issues because mini led does not suffer burn in. 

You can’t use an oled in that way. They overheat and they suffer burn in when static elements are used. No amount of pixel shifting and cleaning can stop that. Only delay it somewhat. 

Just because your screen doesn’t have burn in yet doesn’t mean it never will. It’s the most prolific problem with oled. It will not be fixed rather oled will be abandoned in favor of MicroLed.


It didn’t when they introduced it, would have to check again. AirPlay works without your Apple ID. Don’t see why this would be any different to check credentials. But same with the iPhone as webcam feature. 

“Multiple IDs? Get fucked.”
- Apple


And yet you can't actually multitask with it.


I think a 16” iPad Pro would be extremely popular.


I would fully ditch my Shield if it had this. My wife and kids lose the remote daily.


How is it 2023 and not a single major tv manufacturer or set top box OEM made a remote that will ping or be trackable in some way? Has no one who’s worked at these companies never lost a remote in their life?


I almost strictly use my iPhone as a remote, even though I got one of those sleeve cases with an AirTag holder. For me, it’s just more inconvenient to reach for a second device, I guess


I hide mine and forbid any of the kids from using it. They can only use the regular TV remote that’s been programmed to the Apple TV.


I could see them adding this on the Siri button.


If you speak into the remote “Change to my user” it does just that


Even just a PIN would do. Something - anything - to make profiles useful.


Notifications to connect your AirPods are also pretty intrusive especially when you walk past when someone else is watching


Said this in another comment: I have to charge my remote 3 times a year; might be wasteful to build in all kinds of charging tech that will only be used 15 times over the entire life of the device.


With the new remote camera feature we shouldn’t even need a port. It’s crazy the ATV still doesn’t have FaceTime.


It can.  

It also works with the HomePod minis.


The technology doesn’t exist yet.


I would be willing to bet that’s not true.


[deleted]


I think that’s the plan. I noticed Capcom been working with them because of the M series chips. (This is major speculation from what I’m seeing.)

 It really wouldn’t be a shocker in 5 years that they would be competing with Steam.( Not in total game catalog, but with new releases.) By then it would be over a billion devices powered by the M series chips. Plus those chips are gonna to be used to power their VR & AR devices.


ProMotion would be nice for tvOS, meaning seamless transitions from 24hz (movies) to 120hz (UI)


Apple basically used to do that with the S-Tier iPhone releases every other year.  Bigger feature changes followed by an S model the next year that was more of a spec bump with minor feature changes.

The problem with only updating products every two years is that only a minority of users ever upgraded every year in the first place.  But regardless, every year there is a pool of users with older phones or computers who want to upgrade, and if they want to upgrade during the second year of a product cycle, they are likely to feel boned when a few months later the new version comes out and it represents a 2-year leap in technology and performance.  Annual release cycles mean the consumer is always getting the latest tech when they buy the product.

And to that point, Apple is just one company.  The rest of the tech industry is constantly advancing and Apple has no control over that.  Tech progress has not slowed so much that longer release cycles won't still result in users getting less useful life out their purchase if they buy late in the cycle.


What would the iPhone do with Ray Tracing? Sounds like a battery drain with no front end user benefits.


AR headset all year long


It definitely feels like it. They’re running out of things to do with a metal and glass rectangle unless they really go crazy with something like a foldable or back screen or something, but that’s not very on-brand for Apple.


of course not. I can’t think of any industry that Apple could disrupt if they made their own version of it. Like the AirTag for example.

Maybe Apple could make a Toothbrush 🤷🏽‍♂️


Also don’t they have larger batteries? The reason I went for the 2nd gen AirPods Pro’s was because my 1st gen pros had significant battery decay and the release lined up with my Apple Watch ultra purchase however I was considering buying a new pair of 1 gen pros however wasn’t committed. With the larger battery of AirPods Max it can make the decay of the battery much slower so less people would think “let’s just upgrade because the battery is going”.


I want usb c and the supposed rtx capacity.


USB-C is probably the most exciting potential update for iPhone at this point.


Gilding the lily is a lovely term to use


USB c, ray tracing, more storage, possible thermal camera?


USB c is top concern. Ray tracing would be a fun gimmick. Higher resolution camera. A new lense for thermal imaging perhaps? More storage and lower prices.


Why do you have to reset them?


> Not saying it’s bad

I'm saying it's bad, both in itself and relative to alternatives.  At least mine are.  Maybe they've gone defective or my hearing has somehow gotten better, but I can sit in a relatively quiet pizza parlor (I'm the only customer in there) and still hear its gently playing dining room radio with the ANC turned on (as recently as yesterday).  I can wear them with audio and ANC while washing dishes and hear the water running, typing on my Mac and hear the clicks, walking on a treadmill and hear the belt, in the backseat of a car and hear murmuring from the two people in front having a conversation.

The only value they have for me at this point is how they can save me some taps when moving from Apple device to Apple devices (switching active connections).  In terms of audio isolation (poor ANC in my experience), physical connectivity (Lightning), customization (limited equalizer), etc, they suck in 2023 in my opinion.


Yeah not sure what that's about. I don't have that issue.


I always wonder if this is by design.

It would be so easy for Apple to release ‘the perfect device’ by addressing all of these issues in a single generation update, but they trickle them out so there’s *always* an update to look forward to.

Are you really gonna wait several years for the AirPods Pro to update with USB-C? Or are you gonna buy them now and enjoy them, then somehow justify an upgrade when the updated versions finally do ship?

Seems like a good business strategy to always *almost* release the perfect device, but never entirely.


I'll admit I'm not a subject matter expert but I do know that the only way I can get audio to pass from the Lightning port in my Max to the USB-C port in my MacBook is by using a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter ($35, DAC included in dongle) that is plugged into a separate 3.5mm to USB-C adapter ($10). Ideally I could just plug a Lightning to USB-C or USB-C to USB-C cable and have it work without two additional dongles to work with two Apple devices.


So that we can charge all of our apple products with one cable and so that we can get faster charging speeds


Because I, and I’m sure thousands of other people, just come back from travelling to see family and friends for the holidays. Lightning is a hinderance and a pain in the ass. 

You’re clearly itching for a discussion (ok, why?) when there are hundreds of articles written about this. I’ll sum up my position. I won’t be responding to you. 

My iPad, MacBook, Chromecast (with Google TV), battery bank, and Nintendo Switch all use USB C.

My iPhone and AirPods don’t. So I have to carry a separate lightning cable for them. I don’t use all these devices are once, but even having multiple cables it’s incredibly annoying to have to find a unique cable when I bought a 6-pack that works every device except for those two.

MagSafe is not a replacement for cabled charging, and is wasteful when you’re using an external battery bank. 

The delays made it necessary to have a physical connection, or I could MagSafe and let my phone heat up while I’m trying to navigate the mess in December. Ignoring that the iPhone 14 pro doesn’t work with many MagSafe-compatible accessories because of the giant camera. 

My car rental had wired CarPlay. Cool, now I need to bring/buy an extra cable to leave in my car or take it with me everywhere. 

When Apple is pushing a digital wallet solution have a proprietary physical connection is stupid - no matter how common place it is in North America. Their new Apple TV remote uses usb c, one of the least portable iOS devices. 

I don’t care that lightning predates usb c. 

I don’t care that people are going to have to replace their accessories. 

I don’t care that it will create more e-waste temporarily. 

I don’t care if *you* like lightning or wireless charging. 

USB C has fit in places where lightning was, either by apples’ design or mods. There’s no argument to keeping it.


Advancement is cumulative.

The theory behind it is sound. It has been proven in concept.  We’ll get there.

Important to remember it doesn’t have to be medical grade accurate for a consumer level device. It just has to be accurate enough to show trends and alert on possible emergencies, similar to the afib/ecg functionalities.


> Non invasive blood glucose monitoring would be such a monumental game changer. 

Not to simp for Apple but it probably doesn't have to be non-invasive. A smaller/better/longer lasting implanted chip/device under the skin for real-time blood sugar monitoring integrated with Apple Health tech is probably enough for many people to buy it.

But yes, I agree that non-invasive blood sugar readings are a tech definitely not ready for consumers anytime soon. I'm pretty sure the O2 sensor isn't even all that reliable but I could be wrong about that.


Yeah they seem worse than every other high end over the ear cans.


Apple uses a 3 year cycle for their iPhones, 2023 is the 4th year. We had the rounded design from iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8. Then an absolute complete redesign happened with iPhone X to iPhone 11. The squared off design is in its 3rd and usually final year starting with the 12 to now 14 Pro. Before this it was every two years for a refresh. I think the 14 Pro was their start of a redesign in stages as the display was first and then the chassis will be next with the 15 Pro. Hopefully we see a redesign similar to the Apple Watch Ultra. I would love a complete titanium frame.


I think you just meant crash detection right?

the 4S brought nice camera improvements and the first dual core processor, in terms of performance it's miles ahead of the 4.

The s8 on the other hand...


siri is an AI assistant that can streamline device interactions. 

the crash detection is a safety feature that has already saved lives. 

they are not the same, "like" is not a word that can at all describe these two things. 

"hey siri, call 911" is a great thing to have if you need to do CPR and try to get emergency help if no one is around to be delegated the task. 

crash detection is great to have when your car goes off a cliff, and your phone automatically reaches out for help (an actual event that occurred.)


>  and brings very little speed benefits in pretty much all real world deployments unless you're using mmwave, which the watch would definitely not have.

I just wanted to touch on this because, while it was true when 5G initially deployed, it's simply not true anymore. But we're going to travel back in time to the 3G --> 4G (and LTE) transition. This was true back then as well.

When Verizon switched LTE on, they initially advertised speeds of 5-12mbps. I was on T-Mobile which, at the time, wasn't ready for LTE so they were deploying 3G UMTS HSDPA+ 42mbps, with real world speeds of about half that. I was getting speed test results of 15-25mbps. This was a 3G technology (and the pinnacle of it) matching or beating out LTE at the time, so T-Mobile (and AT&T with their 21mbps version of it) decided to call it "4G." HSDPA+ 14mbps and slower (real world speeds of about 7-8mbps) was branded as 3G (or 3G+), and 21-42mbps HSDPA+ were "4G" (lovingly called faux-G back then).

Over time, LTE got much faster and, me living near a tower, I was able to pull 200mbps+ on speed tests. When I got my first 5G phone, the difference between the two wasn't very pronounced. It is now. Here are speed test results run via Ookla at my home with the iPhone 14 Pro limited to LTE, and then on 5G Auto.

* LTE - DL = 261 mbps | UL = 15.1mbps
* 5G - DL = 676 mbps | UL = 103mbps

Some notes on this - I don't have MMWAVE at my location, and carrier-aggregation (T-Mobile's new CA method) is only enabled on like 1 or 2 Samsung phones at this point. But the speeds are so good we switched over to TMO Home Internet. We get DL speeds of 400-700mbps typically, and UL speeds of 80-115mbps.

So while there was definitely a time where 5G's slowest speeds matched 4G's fastest speeds, that time has since passed, just like the similar transition from 3G to LTE.


It’s not about the score alone. Its about the fact they present content more prominent. It’s not important which streaming service is used. All that count is I get quicker to the things I want to see…


https://www.flatpanelshd.com/pictures/chromecast2020_2_large.jpg it is different… it looks like inside of Netflix. Just with all you streaming services included. And more over its selected things according you interests


I too have a years old OLED, play hours
and hours of XBOX on it, leave paused bright colors on screen for hours, zero burn in. 6-12 months, I’ve been doing this since 2018.


That is not true in real world usage. Mine is on ~10 hrs a day used with a HTPC and lots of apps with static elements like twitch, photoshop and spotify etc. Burn in isn't a problem if you apply common sense.


totally different factors


could have sworn that rumor was reported a few months ago so went googling and found it: https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/26/16-inch-ipad-next-year-report/


why? then it's just a laptop but you have to buy an extra case to keep the screen safe and/or type

i have physically hidden the remote in order to force myself to use my phone instead. it's way better, or at least way harder to lose


My new Roku has it, it's great.


[deleted]


Can’t you just use your phone?


Me personally, you’ll have to pry my shield from my cold dead hands before I go back to AppleTV. I used an AppleTV for several years and switched to Shield on a whim. It’s amazing and I love it. Not having to use Apple’s gated App Store is soooo nice.


What do you do for volume?


Same. mostly because my wife monopolizes the actual Apple TV remote.


Yeah, honestly profiles will only be truly useful when apps can be aware and you don’t have to select an individual app profile once you’re in an app.  It’s nice to see all my stuff in the TV app without the kid’s stuff but then each app asks who I am anyway!


I’m surprised more people don’t understand this.


It’s kind of wild to me that they haven’t done it yet. In and of itself that relatively inexpensive hardware addition (yeah camera stuff gets silly expensive, but that’s much bigger sensors and glass, and they don’t have the space constraints phones do) would make the thing a powerhouse of a device. Once the TV has the hardware, you’d quickly get support for the major other video providers, too, and TV to TV video chat is just more than phone to phone is. 


Plus apple loves people using their devices in ways that make people notice them. Putting the TV where it can get a decent camera angle means it’s front and center under/over the TV instead of tucked away somewhere.


What is the use case of a home streaming device being able to download and watch movies while not connected to the internet? Most will always be connected unless there is a outage and the rest may use a phone hotspot but that's definitely not a large chunk of users, with the rest always have their device at home


Which is funny as it's just basically apple finally catching up with the rest of world! 😄


> lower prices

Of all the things you list, this is least likely to happen. That ship has sailed. They've canceled the next SE for christ's sake.


Because they stop working. They’ll show connected to my phone but I can’t get the audio to play through them. Or they just don’t connect at all. 

It literally happens multiple times a day.


Perhaps your pads are wearing out?

Yep, this is also why both political parties don't make common sense changes that populace legitimately wants... They'd rather use those key issues as carrots to dangle in front of voters to get them to the polls (while blaming the other party for their inability to pass said changes).


I don’t know why Apple blocks digital audio from USB-C to the lightning port on the APM’s. I’ve used other headphones that do this USB-C to USB-C. If you are wired through 3.5 then back to USB-C you are converting to analog, then back again to digital, then again to analog. Not ideal from a sound-science perspective. Out of curiosity, why do you use the dongle on the MacBook, can’t you use the headphone jack?

When you are using them wirelessly though, the digital audio gets sent from the MacBook to the headphones over Bluetooth, then the headphones have a DAC that converts the signal to analog for the speakers in the headphones.


So you travelled for one week and had to include one other cord and it was a hinderance?


I just got the new Libre 3, and it's nearly perfect. Much smaller than the previous models and automatically updates. I mean, I guess a longer battery life would be nice, but two weeks is pretty good.


iPhone 15 pro should have improvements across the board, they played it safe with 14 pro.


I guess I'm in the minority, I hate the watch designs, I love the squared edges on the 12-14, and would love to see that come to the watches


Ok relax. I mean in the simple sense of the two being slightly marginal upgrades. My series 5 has crash detection. Presumably the iPhone 4 wouldn’t have had a hard time processing Siri commands. The two aren’t massive feature driven upgrades in my opinion. Not enough value for a complete hardware revision if you already own an older version.


Siri is trash. Crash detection as an upgrade feature is trash.


Ok, what is the speed you get to your service?  I feel like it only takes me a few seconds to get to mine on Apple TV


does it only suggest shows/movies available to you?


Who wants a high-powered unitasker, though? iPadOS should be able to mop the floor with Windows, but it hasn't substantially improved in years.


Yeah there have been rumors floating around for a while. I expect that Apple has made internal demo models iPads in many different sizes. I hope they decide to release one!


Digital artists using the iPad as a canvas (mostly at a desk), musicians using it for sheet music, designers, reading books or newspapers with larger print for people with sight issues. Lots of pretty niche use cases.


I have a little silicon sleeve on my Apple Remote that holds an air tag. As a bonus, it keeps the remote much cleaner from my children.

However, if they released a new remote with built in AirTag, I’d probably buy one.


They just need to add a beeping sound to the remote. Can have it activate by double tapping the Apple TV box or on your iPhone.


Why not just use the remote until you lose it?


It’s convenient but TV is too old to control the volume :/


I know, that’s why I said I’d switch from shield if apple had it


Volume buttons on the phone control the TV volume if your TV supports CEC (most TVs in the last decade do). I have a surround system hooked to a receiver and the AppleTV controls that volume via my phone.

If you have a 14 Pro, you don’t even need to open the remote and can open the dynamic island and use the volume buttons there to control the tv volume.


That’s because developers didn’t add support for it. Apps can be aware.


Traveling on a cruise or staying in a hotel somewhere which has shitty WiFi. Being able to download all your movies or shows as you can on a iPad or iPhone would be great.


Never had that problem, and I work with them 8 hours a day. I’d get those checked! Or make sure it’s got the latest update


Oh, just like my regular AirPods.


I replaced the cups fairly recently.  Didn’t make a difference.  While they make the phones look a bit restored (cleaner), from a functional perspective they ultimately felt like a waste of money.


Have you tried others, and are they substantially better?

Because one thing I’ve learned by people discussing ANC is that they usually don’t understand the limitations of it. The higher the frequency of the audio, the harder it is to cancel. Running water is a pretty high-frequency noise, much harder to cancel than, say, airplane drone or traffic noise. No ANC headphone is ever going to make *every* noise go completely inaudible. The amount of money you pay is irrelevant, the technology only goes so far, and especially with Apple you’re paying more for very high quality audio and build quality, leaving features like ANC the same as much cheaper products regardless. 

I feel like a lot of people simply have extremely high expectations and come away disappointed when really no other product would have been better anyway.


>	Out of curiosity, why do you use the dongle on the MacBook, can’t you use the headphone jack?

The issue first cropped up when I was using my iPad Pro (which does not have a 3.5mm port). I thought it would be nice to get improved audio quality while charging before discovering that they can *only* charge when directly connected. Then I thought, well, maybe it’s a limitation of the iPad or iPadOS, so I tried on my MacBook and of course saw the same result. 

I didn’t even own a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter at the time so it was a bit of a kick in the shins to drop $550 on these fancy Apple headphones and then learn I need to spend another $35-$45 on dongles to use them wired with other Apple devices.


Imagine some tiny chip implanted underneath the wrist location where the watch goes that's reverse wirelessly charged my the watch itself or something. The options are out there that would be so cool.


You can turn on and off which services are shown.


Same… and bonus if you use the AirTag as an NFC tag in Shortcuts, people in your house who have iPhones can tap their phone against the remote to change the AppleTV to their profile.

This would be a killer feature built into the remote if they add AirTag-like stuff directly into it.


Have a 14pro, thanks for the tip. I didnt know this.


The original comment was talking about the apple tv hardware, yeah on iPad and iphones that would be good but we weren't talking about the service but the hardware


Yea, I’ve been meaning to do that. Once I reset them though they work fine for a few hours.


The Bose NC700s (at least when they first came out as I returned them for usability reason), the AirPods Max when I first got them when they first came out, the Sony WH-1000XM5 and especially the Sony WF-1000XM4 (those are likely aided by their natural in-ear noise isolation design) have all noticeably performed better in that scenario.  In fact I recently wore those buds during a family holiday get-together with "Cocomelon" being played by grandparents to try to get a little toddler to dance.  I didn't want to hear the Cocomelon and I was actually washing dishes at the time.  I stood over the sink with running water, Cocomelon being played from a TV in a nearby room and Lady Gaga playing in my ear.  All I heard was Lady Gaga and *maybe* a low audible *shhh* of the running during gaps between tracks.  Cocomelon was completely blocked out of my world.  My AirPods Max on the hand?  Oftentimes I have to press the button to toggle between transparency mode and ANC ***because I can't actually tell which mode is currently active without confirming the corresponding sound effect from the headphones***.  That says a lot to me (in particular, it says to me the ANC sucks).

Two major sources of my frustration with AirPods Max are:

1. I know from hands on experience other products have better ANC performance at lower prices
2. I know from hands on experience my AirPods Max have worse ANC performance than it had when I first got them.

It's not really about having unrealistic expectations.  I know from experience products can be better than my AirPods Max currently are.


If they had better isolation + ANC they should be able to block out most background noise. My Senheiser HD25s can do it without ANC.


I didn’t think about doing that.


I’m talking about AppleTV. I’d love the ability to download movies and shows onto the AppleTV just like can on a iPad/iPhone. Then you can can easily take the AppleTV with you on trips and watch your content without WiFi/Cellular.


That sounds like a Bluetooth lease timeout failing to reset. 

If the headphones connect well to another device, I’d look into resetting the phone Bluetooth to factory settings. 

Essentially, whatever “keys” the phone is using to track the MAC address of the headphones is corrupted (perhaps it’s in there twice but one is broken and hidden). A zombie entry. 

So you reset, it says “oh, headphones, connected!”

Then after a period of time, the headphones come back from rest and say “iPhone, you there?” And iPhone says “zombie? Is that you? Connecting you to nowhere.”

Factory reset forces a clean Bluetooth database (look at the reset settings area). 

Also, beware that factory reset wipes ALL entries in BT, so you’ll have to reconnect anything else. 

Also REALLY beware that I’m talking about factory reset the BLUETOOTH, not the phone itself. You’d lose everything if you did that, like photos and apps.


Ok but then the person said "that's a pretty niche usage" and you said no it's not but most apple tvs don't leave the tv they are plugged into, I've heard of travel Chromecasts because they're cheap and work well enough but not of an travel apple tv


Guessing these will be minor with new processors, nothing more.


I'd love to upgrade, especially now that they have USBC but £499 for 64GB seems a little much.


Sadly, Gurman has just said the opposite. Hopefully, they will update the iPad Air because I'm thinking of buying one.


introducing, new ipad, now with ability to open all apps 0,00005% faster than last year


Great news, almost ordered one yesterday but couldn't decide between the air and the pro.


No! We want a 27 inch iMac!!!


Curious. My current pro is getting old at almost 7 years.


the things i’d do for an ipad mini with 120hz. doesn’t seem likely though


Only two things will make me update my iPad Air 4:

- OLED
- ProMotion

So it’s going to be a while.


Time to get yelled at by the wife for bringing home a iPad mini.  I have been warning her, I will get a mini this a year and not a new iPhone.


Put 120hz displays in the air lineup and make promotion 240hz


People trying to upgrade is it for a specific functionality which is missing in your current device or something else?


Agh, so annoying. My 2017 iPad Pro kicked the bucket 3 weeks ago and I needed to replace it but the prices here are insane so I got an air 5, and now there are better ones incoming? I wonder what I can get for a trade in.


Having a 2018 11” iPad Pro, I think the only thing they could do to make me strongly want to upgrade is to launch an iPad that runs macOS (and adapt macOS to work simultaneously with touch and non-touch screens).


really want refreshed 24 inch iMac :(


What do people use iPads for mostly? I’ve never found a use for one in my life and I’m curious. They are neat little devices though


well, well


Damn I just bought a base model iPad because I read someone say a refresh this month wasn’t likely. Guess I’m returning lol.


I could use an iPad mini for on the go.

Anyone have it with a cellular plan? I'm thinking of using it for the car and work.


Guess me buying an iPad Pro 12.9 three weeks ago caused the universe to release new iPads 🤪


Might be worth an upgrade. My Air gen 1 is near impossible to use because of lag


An army of r/ipad users preparing their best versions of the ‘iPad doesn’t need new hardware iPad needs macOS’ takes now


Unless they give us a new base iPad with USB-C and support for the gen2 Apple Pen, I couldn't care less.


another year, another disappointing update


Excellent. Time for an upgrade.


Still clinging on to an iPad Air 2 from new. I know I got 8+ years out of it but looking at the cost of updating, £669+ seems ridiculous.


Been wanting the gen 10 hopefully price goes down


All I want is for base iPad to get laminated display but that would make Air kinda pointless.


[deleted]


The IPAD mini really needs a 120 hz screen


I do hope the iPad mini gets a better display akin to the iPad Pro. That display is lovely.


I hope they drop the price of the base iPad 10th gen (or 11th gen I guess), and remove the 9th gen. The lineup is confusing af and needs to be simplified.

Oh and get it the 2nd gen pencil or create a 1st gen with usb c while we’re at it. This current solution is a MESS.


Not happen


iPad Mini “update” is disappointing.


Tbh I don't believe in the tablet form factor at all. It's a mixture of a phone and a computer that seems to result in the worst of both worlds: Less powerful than a computer and less portable than a phone. Everyone I've seen purchase a tablet has stopped using it within a few months, simply because it covers a middle ground that doesn't really need to exist for most people.


Gimme gimme minnie with 5G and 120hz and typec.


Hoping they fix the dust ingress to the front camera problem. Both my last two iPads were in cases and went from a backpack to a desk, and yet the cameras became so blocked by dust that they were unusable.


[deleted]


Pretty sure this has been debunked already. They think it will just be a new Apple Pencil only


No iPad pro?


I need a replacement for my 2015 ish mini, but if no M chip, no buy.


The only thing that will make me open my wallet is an OLED screen


I wanted an air but €790 for 64gb is such a joke


Question. My wife got an Air about a month ago. Will Apple let us trade like for like?


Don’t they mean next week? It’s Sunday


Lol


Just got a mini 6 and like it, im nervous of fomo :(


Anyone in this thread that regrets buying an iPad Pro and it’s been laying around collecting dust…. Throw it on eBay and hit me up and I’ll give you $50 for it.


Who cares? Not me….


Galaxy Tab s9 series absolutely smokes the ipad series this year. The OLED is a huge advantage for a tablet.

And snapdragon 8 gen 2 is not like any slow compared to A15 in fact it has a better GPU. Sure M2 is faster but it's useless on ipadOS.

Not to mention expandable storage on the s9 and starting from 256gb. And meme ipad Air at 64gb. What a clown line up. ipad is by far the worst product lineup apple makes. Only the 9th gen ipad is worth buying.


n4etgbdvs


I would love an iPad Pro 11 with micro-LED display. I still have the 2017 model.


I wish that iPad have an option to run MacOS now that they have the same chips since M1 found in MacBooks.

Either that or bring Pencil and Touchscreen function to MacBook.


Might be time to upgrade, my 2018 iPad 6 is going through it. Just dropped 30% in 10 minutes the other day


I highly doubt I’ll move up. Just got the 12.9 inch one last month after upgrading from the trade in for the 11 inch pro.


I’m hoping for an iPad Pro with the X70 modem. No love?


When new airpods max?


would love a face id on mini. Sadly it would arrive here at double the price of the current mini (that is almost double the usa price anyway)


I've been thinking about buying an iPad for a while. Is it worth the money if I mostly want to use it in the sidecar mode?


Headlines with no "rumor" or "likely" in the title should be banned. I think it's certainly likely that they'll be released, but these headlines are clickbait and false if it's not on Apple's website.


My gen 10 iPad  64 GB from December 2022 works nicely.


I want an Ipad to go along with my mcp for when I'm working outside of home, but shit the prices are stupif. $500 for less than 128GBs? I'm not drinking that kool-aid Apple


A15 ipad, A16 mini, and M2 air there you go.


I got excited thinking it was likely a new Pro.


*And here I am with my 3rd gen iPad.* The chonky boi still works.


They need to make them dockable and able to run osx. They have to much power to be so crippled


If it's true that they're only putting an A16 in the iPad mini 7, then I am SO glad I didn't wait for it and that I just got the Mini 6 when I did. The only thing that would make me even consider selling my Mini 6 is if it had some variation on the A17 that still has all the gaming benefits as the A17 Pro. I don't care if it's a lower-clocked A17 Bionic or whatever, as long as it still has the hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading.  (I would love to be able to play the upcoming Resident Evil game on my Mini.)  


I personally don't notice jelly scroll and performance already feels buttery smooth on the A15 to me, so at least whatever Apple unveils is unlikely to give me buyer's remorse; I only bought the Mini 6 a couple weeks ago! lol 😅


If they don’t release a 30 inch iPad I might as well kms


ipad pro m3 32gb for just $650 or upgrade to ipad pro m3 256gb for $1200.


I’m waiting for iPad mini to have m2 chip as well. Somehow apple doesn’t want this to be the best device…


All I want is the smaller pro to get the better screen of the bigger one. That’s it. And they’d have me immediately.


What's the point of an M2 chip in an iPad Air


I hope the Mini gets upgraded to an M Series like the Air.


New iPad mini!! Sweet!!


I always trust Super Charged News for the latest scoops


My family and I have had an iPad for about 10 years. I'm wondering if there's any reason to get another to be honest since I recently got a MBA M1 2020.


My A10X chip in my ipad Pro 10.5 keeps up with pretty much anything that i need to do on the ipad (watching media, browsing, note taking). So, I expect the A15 in my  mini 6 to stay relevant for even longer as I only really use it for media consumption, browsing and light games. I dont even notice the jelly scrolling any more, so none of these rumours have any interest for me


Really hope they come out with a m2 air with the hover pen features


The fastest iPads ever!!!


Excited to pickup a new iPad mini. My mini 2 just died on me


mini


Just upgraded to a pro yesterday… will there be a big difference for that? Going to read the article now

Edit: mini, air, and entry level are getting spec bumps with air getting an M2 chip. Pro was already upgraded in 2022.


GUYS WE ARE INTRODUCING INNOVATIVE NEW COLORS TO THE IPAD LINEUP


14.6 Inch IPad?!?


iPad Titane don’t bend it anymore


I’m not sure what can be done more to improve the iPads. I don’t foresee myself moving on from my iPad Pro 5th Gen with 12.9” screen when it came out for at least another half decade without significant innovation and I’m not sure what more can be done at this point. An iPad with the M1 was already quite the jump


The only feature that will make me drop my iPad Pro and buy a new one is having the 3.5 jack back.

It's freaking annoying having to find a usb c hub that also has an audio jack. I need this to plug in my headphones and midi controller.

The iPads are great for music production otherwise.


Now the iPad Mini just needs a better screen and 120hz.... I love my 6th gen but man, that definitely would justify it for me to upgrade.


This is the apple way


I bet the iPad Air front facing camera is reoriented


I'm sure I'm the minority but after using a Galaxy Tab Ultra I want a bigger iPad than the current Pro.


And what did you expect? A holographic 3D projector from star wars? Built in USS Gerald R.Ford? AI girlfriend?


What do you expect then?


The article says the air is going from m1 -> m2 chip. That’s a pretty stellar upgrade.


All I’ve wanted


It’s the none pro right?


What other improvements does the iPad need?


not just another camera upgrade? s/


In before they drop OLED displays and updates design


since they are not hyping the ipads, it seems like the updates will not be significant.


I feel like they are going the way of the ipod touch.

Apple probably have way more tech up their sleeves but you can’t release that every year otherwise they will not make money. Spec bumps are what gives them profit


A 16 inch iPad Pro for artists maybe??


Apple struck gold with that M1. Everything since has been minor upgrades


They didn’t even bother to do an event so its probably a spec pump.


At least the 10th Gen iPad will go down in price so score!


Apple should be ashamed of 64gb offerings. It’s 2023… 64gb was terrible more than 5 years ago, now it’s comically bad.


You could always use it as an opportunity to pick up last-gen for cheaper. either you can spend less and get an already very refined product, or if the refresh is groundbreaking it's even more of an upgrade for the money.


Do all iPads not have it already? My iPad I bought like 3 years ago gas USB-C. I have a pro, maybe it was the pro only that got it?


My iPad Air 4th gen (2020) has a USB-C connector.


That’s the biggest change needed.
I love having an iPad mini for the kids but 64gb isn’t enough and 256gb is £750+. 
So as it stands. The kids will be getting an android tablet when the mini 5 dies.


[deleted]


They've had USBC


It already has M1. Most likely pros will be upgraded with M2 pro or something similar ~~and base iPad will get USB c~~.


If iPad Air is updated and it means current gen Air will get cheaper that would be the one to get. M1 and M2 isn’t that big a difference on iPad OS


The smarter move would be to get a 2018/2020 iPad Pro, which will be cheaper with significant benefits over the Air, like the better display, FaceID, and camera system


Don't tease me


\*camera zooms in on Tim Cook

"This is the best ipad we have ever created!"


And we think you gonna love it.


Maaan, sounds too good to be true.


but the box is new!

Still making jokes fit for children eh?


Get a 3rd gen pro, Best Buy has them on sale (including stupid discounts on the 1tb and 2tb models). A base model is often cheaper than the base model air now.


If you are on the fence then just get a pro.  The air is going to get an m2 chip, that’s it.  It’ll literally be useless as an upgrade.  For $100 more you can get a better iPad with a better screen.  Makes no sense not to.

Apple has lost its touch.


wait for 5 years, m6 is gonna be fire !!


32inch!


21:9 5k2k \~30” thank you very much!


Five inches Tim! Make it the smallest iMac ever! Give the people what they want!


Ah fellow OG Pro user. My 9.7 pro is showing its age now for sure. Should’ve stayed with ipadOS 15. Excited to see the new pro lineup


Wanna use my 2018 pro for 5 more years. (Sorry Tim)


2018 iPad Pro is godlike.


No pros coming out. I just bought a 12.9. Beastly boy.


Also curious. My current iPad 5th generation is 6.5 years old. 

I’ve almost purchased a new iPad many times but have vacillated between an air or pro. Ultimately I get angry at apples memory price ladder between the air and pro and I just say f it and keep using the basic 5th gen. I have other devices I use instead. I would love a current gen iPad Air with 128gb.


Mini is perfect and I’m hoping for a refresh.


for real. they need to focus on the display on smaller models. when i got my m1 pro, it sucked having to get the 12.9 inch to get mini led but even with the blooming it was so much better than the smaller lcd. but it's so insanely big and heavy that i hate using it.


Battery life would be terrible, 90hz would be  a nice compromise.

Speaking from experience, I always found the battery life on my M1 iPad Pro abysmal.


You’re describing the 2024 iPad Pro…


I love the mini for traveling, easier to read/ watch than on a phone, smaller and lighter than a full sized iPad.


I just got a mini, i really like it so far hopefully the refresh isnt toooo much of an upgrade


Apple gives one upgrade every time, never everything together. So you'll get first OLED, then OLED ProMotion, then ProMotion becomes 240 Hz and AmateurMotion becomes 90-120 Hz.


Can anyone really distinguish 120hz from 240hz other than spec chasers?


"Sure, that will be additional $600" - Tim Apple


[deleted]


Jesus Christ are people clamouring for a refresh rate higher than 120hz now?

What a complete waste of battery life

Honestly do any of you actually do anything with these devices beyond just scroll lists and personalise your Home Screen?


Right, it feels like iPads plateaued even harder than iPhones - given that camera being mostly irrelevant, there is very little reason to upgrade, unless you are using an ancient iPad.


My current and only iPad is almost a decade old - iPad Air OG. It still works and has amazing battery life considering, but benefits stops there. I need a modern device that’s faster, supported by iPadOS, and will last the next 5-10 years. Every year I keep meaning to upgrade, but always gets put on the back burner. Maybe this is the year (will at least wait  until holiday sales)


Good question. I’m using a 2018 Pro and I’ve never felt the desire to upgrade. It handles everything I throw at it exceptionally well.


I just bought a Mini yesterday. Love everything but the screen refresh rate. Just my luck a new will come out this week with a higher rate. Can’t decide if I should return it and 🤞🏻.


I am on the original ipad air ( yes, THAT one ). Need to say more ?


\> I wonder what I can get for a trade in.

&#x200B;

Ripped off.

&#x200B;

Seriously, trading in a brand new iPad just so you can get the next generation in a few weeks would be a huge waste of money.


There are rumors everywhere. Were you not curious about new iPads? I decided to go for it because reportedly no pros this year.


Air 5 is the best price per value ipad they’ve ever had imo, I don’t think you should be disappointed (sucks that they’ll probably get a price decrease though)


Where did you get it from? If it’s from apple or Best Buy you can just return it


I just got the same one and I’m loving it. Honestly, the new ones won’t be that much different. If you’re feeling FOMO just head over to r/appleswap. I’m sure you’ll find someone to give you more than what you’d get anywhere else for it.


That would cannibalize their laptop sales so I doubt you’ll ever see that.


I have the same iPad. Only reason to upgrade for me would be OLED (not happening this year) or a huge battery life upI have the same iPad. Only reason to upgrade for me would be OLED (not happening this year) or a huge battery life upgrade.


You mean 27 :)
24 is bullshit and everyone knows it. The 5k 27 iMac was amazing value and of course they took it away to force us to spend 4x for a Studio and the Studio Display, which costs almost as much as that iMac. What the hell are they drinking?


Anything a smartphone with a decent screen can do, but bigger and potentially less distracting. Like I’ve personally seen with friends and family, laptops and computers have been outpaced by phones in what people use them for. The confusing part for me is how expensive and premium the higher end iPads are now. Unless you’re just rich and buy whatever you want (respect), I can’t see spending more than $300 for a larger screen to dick around on.


Hugely popular among artists and illustrators with software like procreate


I use it for portable computing where a laptop isn’t feasible


I use mine all the time!

I read ebooks (in fact I very few physical books now), sheet music (I have other music practice apps on there), take notes at meetings, use it as a screen to fly my drones, FaceTime my family, create cricut designs, watch porn, use it as a star chart when I take my telescope out, and it acts as a microphone for Siri/homekit when it’s plugged in and not in use in my office.  

I also have an iPad mini on my windowsill above my kitchen sink to watch videos or listen to music while I cook and clean. Yeah I could set my phone there and use that, but I have a 13 mini so it’s not the same.


Me neither. I can't even hold a tablet comfortably. It's too big. The Mini is nice but the OS and websites display too small.


Yep. Just got a new mini cause I read it wouldn't happen


I have a cellular iPad mini 6 and it’s so nice not having to worry about setting up a mobile hotspot, especially since I take it with me everywhere.


Only ipad mini and air will come


You want good features on the ipad for broke people lol


What’s left to update? They’re kind of a mature product without much left to improve outside of software.


[deleted]


I’m planning to get the battery replaced. Is your SOT acceptable?


What OS do you run on your kids?


Netflix in the bathroom is a middle ground that everyone needs


It’s not for everyone, but it definitely has its uses. For example I use it a lot for my work (I read and mark up a lot of PDFs, much better on the iPad than reading on my laptop or printing it) and for reading books or watching series in my free time. But yeah, if it wasn’t so handy for my work, I wouldn’t be able to justify the purchase just for media consuption. So I agree that most people don’t need a tablet, but if you have a legitimate use for it, it can be really nice and useful


iPad is great for specific use cases. Note-taking for school can be great. Mine’s my go-to Netflix to fall asleep device, you can just leave it lying down next to you while your head is resting on the pillow. My parents use it as their main computer because their uses are minor browsing, reading the news and Facebook.

The problem is people expect it to be great at tasks for which other form factors are better. It’s great at what it is, a content consumption device primarily. You’re not going to do heavy duty computing on it, and that’s okay.


I agree to some extent. If you’re an artist, it’s a great thing to have. But, it’s really just a pain for workflow compared to a laptop for other tasks. It really just shines as a media consumption device more than anything else, imnsho.


I’ve transitioned to traveling with an iPad instead of a laptop.


I need a bigger screen to read on — I spend a large part of every day doing the rounds of my newsletters, newspapers, etc. Phone is just too small, I’m scrolling constantly.


For me they’re perfect for travelling, feels less fragile than a laptop, but has a bigger screen to watch comfortably on a plane or train.


Yeah, I bought an original mini way back when and I hardly used it after a while. I always think maybe a pro, but I think I’d just stop using it. My grandparents use theirs every day for mail and news, I just prefer the phone or computer. The tablet size is just awkward enough for me not to carry it around.


Nah, one of my use cases is reading manga, I think tablets are the best devices for that content.


Same here. My friend got an iPad Pro with pencil and Magic Keyboard as he thought it will be perfect portable device for him to work on but he kept using his 4 year laptop and eventually gave the iPad to somebody. Apple needs to put a proper OS on it. Same with my parents who I got iPad Air and keyboard and they just don’t use it at all and I have to remind them


It's a nice couch, kitchen, or bed media consumption form factor. It's also good if you're using it to draw


> Tbh I don't believe in the tablet form factor at all. It's a mixture of a phone and a computer that seems to result in the worst of both worlds: Less powerful than a computer and less portable than a phone.

* Phone = <8"
* Tablet = 8" - 11/12"
* Laptop = 12"/13 upwards

Phone primary form factor = light to hold in single hand and put in pocket

Laptop primary form factor = large enough screen to be productive, long battery and keyboard-touchpad mechanical UI and desktop-OS features

Tablet that is 11":

* half the weight of a laptop
* notebook size screen so good for notes with pen or touch use
* screen is usable for books or art or productivity though is small screen for such use
* battery is small for laptop use but becoming better each generation
* optional bluetooth keyboard/mouse for laptop use in addition to tablet use

My opinion is the tablet form factor mainly weight and screen size makes for excellent portable device for tablet use and productivity laptop use but is set back by the iOS/iPadOS for the latter. A soution is Remote Desktop Software. But a better solution would be native use of MacOS-Lite option.

This probably accounts for why most people end up not using it for productivity and a phone is more convenient for casual uses eg web surf for info or contacts.

It's also hobbled when with 5G modem it is not possible to set up cellular phone capabilities either.

This explains your observation: It's fundamentally hobbled by Apple though there are work-around which few people probably use although those come with concessions eg smaller battery, smaller screen.

New hardware won't resolve these issues until the CPU efficiency and battery technology converge more with laptops and materials become lighter and thinner still more. Although providing either:

1. Cellular
2. MacOS-Lite in conjunction to iPadOS

would go a long way to upgrading iPads significantly though they would then cannabalize other hardware lines Apple offers.


Such a bizarre comment.  You don’t “believe in it?”  It’s not a religion, it’s a piece of hardware that exists.  Millions sold and used daily.  I’ve been using them daily since the first iPad was released.  I’m guessing you haven’t seen many people purchase one if they all stopped using it within a few months…


But it’s more powerful than a phone and more portable than a computer


Mine sits on my desk at work unused 99.9% of the time.

I had a short stint of using the notes app to take notes during meetings. But ultimately it is just easier for me to write on paper. I do see people take them to meetings with a keyboard attached which is really basically turning it into a shitty laptop. I'd rather just bring a real laptop because I'll often need an HDMI port and the HDMI to USB dongles are not reliable IME.

I can imagine tablet use cases for games or video but for me that's when I step up to laptop or TV. Ages ago I used to play lords mobile on the tablet and thats a pretty good platform for it. But that's so specific and if I recall correctly LM moved to a laptop version so that's gone too.

Anyway, I tend to agree...I've struggled to find any consistent use for the tablet. I do want to have it because it's good for long airplane trips or train rides. I also may want it when I'm visiting someone and just didn't feel like dragging the laptop along. So it will always be in the lineup but those are pretty narrow use cases.


I agree. If you look at how people were viewing iPads and tablets when they first hit the scene, consumers, analysts and Apple acted like they were a new product that everyone needed to have. Fast forward and tablets really just fill a niche between phone and computer use, they aren't necessary at all, especially when on the Windows side there are hybrid laptops, some fold others detach, offering both a laptop and tablet experience for the price of 1.

If you look at Apples own earnings reports, iPads and Mac are barely selling. They have been surpassed by iPhone accessories (watch, ear pods) and digital sales.

If Apple makes the iPad more usable, by allowing MacOS, then Mac sales will decline. If Apple makes a hybrid MacBook then iPad sales will decline. It's a lose-lose situation.

With the Vision Pro, it's clear Apple is trying to create a new revenue stream, not one that is simply hardware but also completely new digital sales and accessories, because the iPad failed to be that.

As it stands now the iPhone and it's related accessories and services is around 80% of Apples revenue. It's their golden goose, iPad and Mac are nothing in comparison.

If you already have a decent computer, Mac or otherwise, there’s a good enough demand for a tablet as a play device. Not everyone has room or the desire to own a giant TV, and consumers have consistently demanded for more in-home portability. So many people bought Nintendo switches and never play them outside of the home, for example.


My experience is opposite. Other than some times when I need extra screens, I use my iPad Pro for 90% of my daily work. My JAMF-crippled MBP sits unused quite a lot. I carry my iPad to customer meetings and never need a charge for a whole day of email, browsing, Teams, Outlook (OWA), and Office app usage. The magic keyboard transformed my usability experience when it came out.

Yes, I wish it had more MacOS features, but it fits my lifestyle impeccably. I’m not sure I can justify upgrading to whatever this new version will be. I’ll look it at though.


That’s like this sub when iPad first came out lol. “Why would anyone want a big phone that can’t do calls or a small laptop that can’t do productivity”. 

Turns out a lot of people want that.


Reading and writing on ipads>>>>>


So an iPhone pro max?


current mini has 5G and USBC


I’ve been finding that I want an iPad Mini but I don’t see the M chips or ProMotion coming to the device in a long long time. For me, a super high end chip like the M series is not too important in an iPad mini, but I would absolutely love 90hz-120hz refresh display. I can’t go backwards


Downvoted for the truth. Reddit all over


Pros have always been out of sync, I think usually around March time.


Sadly not- unless you are within the return window.


no, return it if it's within the window - but otherwise you'll just get the regular mid trade-in value.


Not just Apple

This IS the way these days.


does another major company release insane updates every year? samsung phones haven’t exactly had a ‘killer feature’ in years, some cool new features, sure, but to act like this is simply apple? it’s the entire industry. what would you improve on in a new tablet? what can be added that isn’t already there?


Look up the definition of diminishing returns. It was bound to happen.


If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.


Why do you think they need huge upgrades annually????? They’re already great. Wtf else do you want.


Just buy a 15in macbook air at that point it would be just as portable with a much better battery


ProMotion display on iPad Mini PLEASE


Id like to see more improvements with the LiDAR. That is a pretty cool addition and the uses are already pretty awesome


I'd like to see proper Firefox support, running on Gecko. Won't happen, but I'd like to see it.


Hoe about a good Siri? Most valuable company in the world (stock market anyway), and Siri is still shit and useless.


In the context of iPad, is it though? iOS is the bottleneck here, not the hardware.


Not really. M2 was a minor upgrade from M1 on Macbooks, on an iPad with iOS, there is zero chance people actually notice the difference in daily use.


Really? I really appreciate my M1 Macbook Pro because it's a quantum leap from my Intel Macbook which heated more yet performed much less. Aside of the compatibility with Docker, pretty everything is satisfying.

However M2 doesn't seem to provide a significant performance gain compared to M1, at least not enough for the current gen users to replace theirs.

That being said I'll definitely buy the new Air or mini.


Lol how exactly. What will you be able to do with an m2 that you couldn’t do with an m1


No, iPads are still a significant revenue product - long way from being in iPod touch territory. Apple sells almost as many iPads as Macs. Also the iPad Pro (both models combined) make up about 45% of all iPads sold from sales surveys.


I wasn't making an opinion, just stating fact. But the Air could use Face ID - won't get it because it would hurt iPad Pro 11" sales, but should have it really. Face ID isn't a "pro" feature.


The FaceTime camera needs to be at the top instead of on the side. And thats it.


I second this. I have an iPad 8 that is purely for consumption but it only has 32GB. I have to delete everything and wipe it to make enough room for every update. It’s sad.


It’s just Apple. They sold 16 GB iPhones even when they were virtually unable to update due to the tiny storage


Seriously, 64gb/low storage defending is insane here. If it works out for you, I’m glad your glorified Chromebook suits your needs perfectly


It’s because they want you to buy iCloud storage so they can get a monthly payment from you on top of the cost of the iPad…


Their purpose is mostly to say "Prices from". They are marketing.


It depends on what you’re using it for. Kids homework? Working in the cloud? Field research? 

64gb is plenty for a lot of people. 

Not me, but a lot of people.


Plenty of iPads are used as cash registers or kiosks or other single purpose applications where even 64GB is overkill. Why be mad that someone with a different use case from you is offered something that suits their usecase?


Weird to watch a company with such a positive reputation produce trash and sell it for three figures.


Apple knows they got the golden goose and will milk it til it’s dry


Especially when every app under the sun is over 500 mb


It’s the last “easy” way for Apple to get you into their tiered ecosystem. It preys on those who don’t know anything about technology. I say that as someone who has an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, Apple watch etc.

iPad starting at $399? Deal!

Oh, double the storage for +$100? Sure.

Better model for only another $100? Now we are at $600

Let’s double the storage for it! +$100

…its how Cars work as well. It’s genius, but goddamn does it border on being manipulative when the avg consumer is an idiot (tech wise, no offense).


Yes but because the current, soon to be last, gen is so elevated I'd still be looking at £400+ for last years model (excluding the keyboard and pencil). By contrast I could get a Duet 3 for £399 (and often on sale for £299) with a keyboard and possibly stylus. True, iPad OS is better than Chrome OS, but I regularly find myself merely using my tablet as a basic consumption device in which that limitation isn't a significant factor.


I’m trying to find out, “ground breaking”, so from your point of view, what feature would this be? I’ve had an iPhone since 2008, so I lived through the groundbreaking iterations.


🤡💀


the trouble with that is that the 10th gen iPad handling of the Pencil support is ridiculous and safe to say not many people want to deal with that terrible design. so even if 11th gen isn't much of an upgrade but adds gen2 Pencil support and charging, it will be a much better buy for a lot of people


The base iPad, I believe, still used lightning until gen 9 (we are on gen 10).


They all do now if you get the latest gen (they still sell older gens new from Apple). Just got a baseline one for my daughter and it's USBC. The pros had it first though.


M1 iPad here, not much I could ever ask for. Apart from going OLeD but you ain’t getting that peak HDR these days so nothing else needed.

I’ve tried most current OLED in production around that size and resolution and they still don’t come close to the miniled.

I want to update my iPad but goddamn all I do is watch Emby/Infuse these days. It’s my perfect 4:3 content consumption device.

Maybe if they went 16:10 would be cool.


My 2018 iPad Pro has USBC


I think the older Pros had the USB-C. My 2019 iPad Pro 11” has USB-C.


Mine is 6th gen iPad. I think I will upgrade this time provided it's priced accordingly.


And Apple no longer sells a new iPad Air 4th generation (2020) in the UK.


Me: I think a £499 device should come with 128GB onboard storage especially a device which doesn't come with mobile as standard.

You: Just spend an extra £180 for cellular (implied since cloud storage is non-local) and £2.99/month (£35.88/year) problem solved.

The problem is after OS usage, any large games and especially hungry apps there isn't much storage left, if it was cheaper that'd be fine, a reasonable compromise, but it's £500 ($600) for an amount of storage that can be found on phones that sell for £100-£200.

Here's a Motorola G22 for £88.85 with 64GB.

Congrats on the stupidest comment of the weekend.


my kiddos aren’t taking photos at all and easily hit the 64GB barrier from the random apps they install. it’s a huge pain and not really something fixable with iCloud.


Base iPad has usbc


It's been 600 days since the last update. A spec bump (storage/M2) and new colours should be enough.


iPad Pro's are already on M2, and presumably they'll drop the $330 iPad instead of forcing USB C on its design. 
That leaves the Air which will once again make the Pro redundant if they do M2, and the base iPad which they could fix with the Apple Pencil issue and maybe adding Face ID to both models, but they don't seem too keen on fixing these issues to encourage up selling. Theres also still the lack of Mini LED on the 11 inch Pro, but again that seems to solely exist for up-selling purposes.


With your …


We worked hard to improve the packaging (leaving more stuff out)


Do you have a link? Can’t find them on their site


And here I am thinking “unless you need the 12.9 screen real estate, just the the air. Both are super overkill on hardware and the air is plenty for 99% of people.”


[deleted]


I like the air but god it needs more storage options

At least 512gb max, 256gb sucks if you do big side projects and want to actually download stuff to your massive glass slab that’s perfect for entertainment. It’s still a good middle ground for artists not wanting to spend pro money since the 11in pro is hardly any better


48 inches!


I have the 12.9 OG pro and it is showing its age in the worst way.


I have a 2017 10.5, and apart from battery degradation and a screen that is getting harder to keep clean (I think the oil repelling layer is almost gone or so) it is still a beast. It runs 17.0.3, and is still fast for what I use it.


Maybe I’m gonna downgrade. I use it only for browsing, music and youtube. So a Pro is not absolutely needed.

Because of that I bought a S6 Lite, but that absolutely could not match the old 10.5 Pro.


I have the 12.9" pro and feel the same, it's fucking great, but it's bloody cumbersome.  I'm actually debating a mini so I can have it's portability and still use the same pencil on it.  If it gets the M2 chip, I'm gonna be on it in a heartbeat.


People who buy Pro devices just for the screen is why Apple won't put 120hz screens in the base models. Why cannibalize Pro sales by offering a feature that any user can benefit from on all models? Instead, force them to buy the Pro, which is overkill for almost everybody.
Their coffers are full. They're doing ok


If they can use an LTPO display then battery life could be even better than the 60hz display. The iPhones with ProMotion have longer battery life for video playback vs the non-Pros.


Rumours point to just a spec bump


[deleted]


Yes


Absolutely, while it is diminishing, you can tell on its own up to about 300hz, side by side to 480, and past that you can’t tell a difference cause the response time of LCD panels can’t really get under 1ms.


[Can’t believe I get to use this two days in a row.](https://reddit.com/r/apple/s/vhxpg97VLx)


My only reason to upgrade is my iPad is stuck on iOS 15. So I can’t use the data encryption options.


Exactly, except for the PRO functionalities I don’t see major upgrade reasons to move from regular iPad to the higher versions unless and of course there is a “slickdeal”


If you don’t game on iPad, there’s no reason to upgrade. I use gmail, maps, streaming, and Reddit. None of which requires any more power.


Hey me too! Same device but refuse to buy anything new with 64GB.


I suggest return.


Yeah probably. I remember a sales rep saying that my 14 pro was worth something like 500 dollars even though it would fetch like 900+ over here.


Yeah it's good. But I feel like the battery life is worse than my old Pro especially in safari and when watching videos.


It might if it was sold as it currently is but if Apple bundled it with a Magic Keyboard  it would cost as much, maybe more than the 15" MacBook Air, so I don't think Apple would care then which Apple product you are buying.

Make it its own product: iPad Pro Plus. It would be a true convertible laptop. Then keep selling the iPad Pro which would remain iOS only. At the higher price point it wouldn't affect MacBook Air 13" sales, and with no Mx Pro or Ultra chip it wouldn't affect MBPs either.


Among a very small sliver Mac laptop buyers. 

I don’t know anyone that would replace their Mac laptop with an iPad just because the iPad could run macOS. 

Pro MacBooks are actively cooled and significantly more powerful. 

And for the laptops that aren’t actively cooled the form factor and design of a MacBook Air is way way nicer than an iPad with Magic Keyboard.


Yes. Iphone and ipad pros cost as much as a MacBook Air. It's nuts


So a niche


You have an ipad for each room?


[Peak r/apple. Can’t believe I’m posting this a third time.](https://reddit.com/r/apple/s/vhxpg97VLx)

Not much else to improve? No? Not screen improvement like OLED/microLED? Not better camera? Better speakers? Not improved battery life? Bump base model memory? Decrease bezel? Waterproofing? Promotion to 240hz or just giving promotion to lower lines?

Really, not much to improve. Ok then.


The camera. My Air 5 struggles to take a clear enough photo of chalkboards and documents. In my experience, any photo that's taken indoors (regardless if it's a well-lit room) almost always turns out bad---very noisy, poorly focused, and desaturared. I can only get the quality I see in iPad ads when I am outside under direct sunlight.

I am not expecting iPhone-quality photos. I just need iPads to take photos that don't look like they were taken back in 2013.


Are you actually serious? Better screen? 240hz promotion, and 120hz on air/mini? Improved battery, speakers. More ram. Higher storage base model. Less bezel. Lighter. Better front camera. 

Like are we serious here?


M2 is barely an upgrade over the M1, and in iOS it won't even be noticeable


Battery is acceptable for the amount I use it, I’d guess I’d get 4/5 hours out of it if used heavily. It can hold its charge for days when not in use. My issue is light bleed down one side from the official magnetic cover, lack of storage and how sluggish it is.


Tell that to my hemorrhoids ☄️


Talk about first world problems


I have always wondered what the hell is going on in there that it takes so long a movie seems like a good idea. For me, I sit on the toilet, I poop, I wipe, it's over. Usually this is a 30 second affair, maybe less. If I'm severely constipated maybe it's 5 minutes. Longer than that and I'd give up, it'll still be there later lol


"Needs" is a strong word. But maybe that's it, maybe a tablet is purely a luxury purchase, doesn't really enable you to do anything that you couldn't do with your other devices but improves the user experience in a few situations.


A bathroom phone can work better than an iPad and will be cheaper too


Just use a laptop


Which app do you for PDFs? I need to find one that will let me annotate and save over them from Google drive or OneDrive without needing me to import and save back onto the cloud as a new file. I tried a remarkable and the import, open, save, delete OG process was too tedious.


I guess if one travels a lot, a tablet makes sense. I watch series on my 27 iMac. It's the 2010 model ans still going strong. 

My phone is much handier around the house for casual browsing, I can use it with one hand.


Its also extremely useful as a second screen with a macbook. So, mainly a content consumption device for flights, watching videos in bed and sending off a few emails, etc, but occassionally a way to seamlessly double the screen while working at a desk.


IMO a Chromebook is much better and easier option for parents than an iPad. But that could be just my parents


> minor browsing

This is a good way of putting it.

iPad is not for browser power users. Safari is so user unfriendly to me because it doesn't allow switching between multiple browser windows from the magic keyboard.

On my Mac devices I have between 100 to 300 Chrome tabs open simultaneously  depending on how many projects I have going on (organized by named windows across multiple virtual desktops).

How is it possible I can't switch Safari windows using keyboard shortuts (like Cmd` on Mac)? This is such a  basic feature.

I'm guessing this is an artifact of the iPad originally allowing only one browser window so it's technically difficult to shoehorn this basic feature into iPadOS.


I just wanted a consumption devices (owned iPads in the past) and got a Kindle Fire and put Google Play on it and apps. It's great and a lot cheaper than an iPad, aspect ratio is excellent.

Base iPads are great bang for the buck for most anyone.


It fills a gap that doesn't exist for most people, so when most people buy them they end up not being used to a point where if you asked the person "Was this purchase worth the price" they'd answer positively. You cannot tell me that you're happy to have spent $500 on a device to watch Netflix on the shitter on a large screen, when you already have a phone and a laptop. Obviously, there are situations where they are useful, such as note-taking on PDFs and artists, but these are not situations that most people find themselves in.


And my point is that that isn't a very useful middle ground FOR MOST PEOPLE.


Why aren’t you taking notes with the Apple Pencil so you can sync them to iCloud and reference them anywhere anytime?


This guy gets it. Everyone else in this thread is grasping at straws to justify their personal purchases.


They kind of are the worst… you require two drivetrains so one will always be powering the dead weight of the other


That's a terrible analogy, but I'll play along and ask you: If you already have a gas and an electric vehicle, is a hybrid car really useful to you? Similarly, if you already have a phone and a laptop, is a tablet really useful to you?


The iPad mini.


Got it.


True, Samsung does still try to do new things with their tablets (see the S8/9 Ultra) but it was last generation when they brought something really brand new to the table.


Theoretically, doesn't have to be. Companies are too settled in to try new things. They're raking in cash, so their thought process is "why change what's working", even though they could be making more than just camera changes -_- (think new sensors (i.e. the Pixel 8's temperature sensor), better battery life, a true P2P/decentralized networking or messaging protocol, built in hardware stands, etc)


Spot on, tablets have almost reached the peak of innovation where the one thing that can consistently be changed would be the processor


I mean realistically what can you even do to an ipad / iphone to make it legitimately *better*? Foldability is a gimmick. Short of holographic keyboards and screens, and better battery life theres really not any possible innovation in this space that excites me.

its kind of like how cars for the last 50 years have just had incremental improvements.


Doesn't every major manufacturer now have the Intel Style Tick-Tock cycle?

Feature updates, then incremental performance updates, then feature updates, in alternating generations?


>what would you improve on in a new tablet? what can be added that isn’t already there?

&#x200B;

Face ID would be a nice.  I don't see that as a "pro" only feature like ProMotion.


FaceTime camera on the top. And that’s about it.


TIL MacBook Air is an iPad


Also OLED


Oh, can't say I could relate to this, cause never used one, my bad. Could you explain, how they could make it better and is it not good enough now?


Indeed, it means nothing. "stellar upgrade" makes no sense


Yeah I’ve had the M1 iPad Pro 12.9 from the day it came out. Performance is rock solid. I’m not updating until they massively increase resolution or get bigger.


I have the m2 iPad, my mom has the m1.  I’ve used hers a fair amount.

I am 110% sure if you had me do a blind test choosing which was which it would be down to dumb luck.


Not a lot of thing you can do on iOS


I wouldn’t expect huge leaps between apple silicone.  I expect them to just be a little further ahead than the closest windows competition.


Things like sidecar should be faster. More headroom for professional desktop apps directly on iPad. 

As of today you can’t point to a difference, but the m2 would allow you to take advantage as that becomes a reality.


Heads up if you are able to, you can plug it into a Mac or PC and usually update the iPad without having to remove a bunch of things.


u/Agreeable-Weather-89 u/chads3058 u/darrevan Totally agree. Apple wants you to spend hundreds of dollars just to have more internal storage on almost every product, especially when it's basically cheap nowadays.


Even if 64GB works for them, arguing that Apple can't be assed to add $5 to the BoM to have a usable iPad for all users is peak corporate boot licking.

Yes, I know Apple does this to ladder customers up the price tiers, but that doesn't make it right or helpful to the customer.


Agreed. Even my kids are complaining with 64GB storage. And this is on top of our 2TB iCloud storage


[deleted]


And a better operating system/device is often situational.


Honestly, 2018 iPad Pro is still miles ahead. It’s a glorified e-reader and Netflix machine with some browsing for me and 120hz with usb c already. Never slowed down and you could get hold of one super cheap.


My "groundbreaking" would be an iPad Mini pro with M-series chip, Thunderbolt, and maybe even 120hz. On the normal iPad there's not really anything I can think of that I know I want, but something like a new way to provide input would be interesting. 


I don't think there's any specific feature I'm dying for vs. just certain products that put them together, but the iPad is just a great product as-is and I have no urge to upgrade.


At this point, my "ground breaker" would be MacOS on the iPad. Otherwise, it is still going to be seen as same old iPad limited by its software.


The base iPad just got it last year in the tenth generation.


I understand, but the 5th gen actually in sale does have it too. Just saying that iPad made the USB-C jump a couple of years ago.


Buy the refurb, it’s better than the iPad 10 and cheaper


[deleted]


They still sell the 9th gen with Lightning, if you consider that the base model.


My bad. A chip upgrade perhaps. Base one will stick with A series chips. Air will have M series. Pro will get M Pro series.


The base Air at 64GB is basically pointless and bumping to 256GB you're now at "might as well get the Pro" pricing.


For me it’s the screen. The screen on the pro is totally worth it


I have a 2018 12" iPad Pro and an iPad Air 5. I Air 5 is nice, but if I could only have one I'd keep the 2018 12" even though it's 5 years old. I just love the 12" screen, even for just consumption. It makes reading and browsing so much easier on the eyes and to have useful multiple windows.


Ultra wide


Yup same I got the 12.9 og pro too


Sure it’s noticeable on applications like gaming but for other applications like web browsing , note taking won’t be noticeable and the battery drain is going to be more significant


“These studies have included both stabilized and unstablized retinal images and report the maximum observable rate as 50–90 Hz.” 

While under certain controlled conditions some participants perceived up to 500 hz I seriously doubt most phone users are in perfectly light controlled environments to justify the extra cost and gpu load.

[Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07861)


I’m using it for basics stuffs and yeah the device is sluggish still. The Air 2 puts me in a weird spot : the today’s standard aren’t betters except the chip meanwhile the airs’s cost is exaggerate


I believe every iPad starts with productivity in mind and then transitions to toilet Netflix within 3 months of purchase

The only productivity use case for me is Sidecar, using it as a second monitor for my MacBook. In which case it is a portable smart monitor


Too unwieldy and heavy.


Drops on the screen? Negligible 

Drops on a keyboard? F


PDF expert, it should be able to do exactly what you’re describing. I don’t use it like that, but yeah you can acess and edit files on your gdrive (not sure about onedrive, maybe too) through the app


They must be selling dozens of them then!


> You cannot tell me that you're happy to have spent $500 on a device to watch Netflix on the shitter on a large screen, when you already have a phone and a laptop

Generally, yes I am. And in the kitchen. The screen and speakers are a huge step up over a phone and it's a much more space efficient form factor over a laptop. And I'm a bit less worried about touching the iPad screen with, say, greasy hands compared to doing the same with my laptop


Over 50 million sold every year.  Just Apple iPads, not counting other tablets.  I wish I could have invented something like that even if it “fills a gap that doesn’t exist for most people”.


Then don't buy it.. millions of people don't agree with you. 

I don't touch my phone when I'm home, everything is use a phone for is better on an iPad. 

Foldable flip phone (something like the latest razr) + iPad is the dream.


That sounds great but in practice it's just easier to have it in real notepads. I had all my notes electronic and in theory it was great to be able to search them but in practice I almost never did.

There were also times when the tech failed and the apple pencil would not work or the app got wonky, so that would suck because then I'm asking for paper and a real pen etc. It wasn't frequent but it was enough that when it did happen I was annoyed.


Apple has sold 589,000,000 iPads since 2012. Who’s gonna tell all those people that their device is useless? I wish someone had told me back in 2014. I’ve been using an iPad HEAVILY the last 9 years and had no idea it was useless.


If even go one further and ask is a tablet really useful if you just have a laptop?  MacBook can open iPad apps…


[deleted]


Aside from the size, what the ultra did that their normal size tablets can’t?


Honestly it feels more tick-tick-tick-tock to me at this point. I remember being floored by the iPhone X and that first 11 inch iPad Pro. The Moto Razr and the first Z Flip and Fold? cool as heck. Its all kinda been the same and just refinement since then.


it isn’t but it’s powerful af and does much more than the iPad


He said pro not air lol they’re much more comparable


The resolution on their LiDAR sensors is pretty bad. I've attempted to do some 3d scans for designing models of things to interface with pre-existing objects using my iPhone 14pm and found that I was better off figuring things out with my calipers and radius gauges and whatnot. 

The flipside to that is dedicated LiDAR scanners are often a couple hundred bucks+ for a decent one that can do that level of resolution. iPhones (and I'd assume iPads run a similar/the same sensor) are fine for like, room-scale objects. If I wanted to model new furniture for my living room a LiDAR scan with my iPhone would probably be sufficient, but for human-scale objects it's blocky and messy.


One example is PolyCam where you literally scan environments or items to make them into textured 3D models

Other options are scanning interiors and having it converted into design files like CAD with a paid service. 

idk just cool stuff


But, but, how can I use buzzwords to make it look like I know what I’m talking about?!


I’ve had the A12x iPad pro from the day it came out. Performance is rock solid. Im not updating until it breaks.


I have my iPad 6th gen since day 1, and I never knew this. Thank you kindly.


Nice. I have a Mac. Thanks for this!


But second hand is a whole other can of worms, I'd still be looking at £300 for a used 9th gen iPad (lightning). The Duet 3 (USBC) is £200.


Exactly. I got the 2020 iPad Pro 11 for dirt cheap and I don't plan to upgrade it in the next 5 years. It's an amazing device for multiple tasks.


Got mine as a refurb for $550 the day the 2020 models were announced. It was definitely the best move. The extra horsepower of the newer models doesn't mean much when it's a YouTube and browsing machine


Me too, and I'm usually a serial upgrader. But Apple just made the 2018 iPad Pro too damn good. Aesthetically it doesn't show its age either.


I loved my iPad mini.


Ahh yeah that be pretty cool! I think we’re beyond the time of new ground breaking capabilities. I would like to see a further differentiation between an iPad and iPhone, to me, and I may get downvoted for this, I still feel like an iPad is just a larger iPhone?


> iPad Mini pro with M-series chip, Thunderbolt, and maybe even 120hz

What is with this sub’s strange obsession with smaller devices? Apple has tried making smaller devices in the past and they just didn’t sell well…

We are more likely to see pigs fly than get an iPad with the specs you posted


[deleted]


But they made it only compatible with the first gen Apple Pencil which you’d need a dongle to charge it lmao


The iPad made it with the 10th generation (2022).


No, do you live in a cave because if you're taking so many photos on an iPad that you need iCloud then you most certainly are a Neanderthal.


While they still sell it it is not the current gen base model, ex : they still sell the iPhone 13 and 14 but they are not considered the current base model iPhones


If the iPad Pro got M2 Pro that would genuinely be hilarious


This is the *real* Apple way. They're masters of the product ladder.


I have a 12.9 Pro and my wife has an air, both M1. I can’t really tell a difference between the screens if we’re using them indoors.


Literally


96 inch


Yes it is. The whole OS if smoother, not just games. It's especially noticeable using a pencil.. 

And it's a negligible battery hit.


That’s the beauty of promotion/VRR. It won’t run it at 240Hz when “note taking” for the exact purposes of battery drain.


Yeah that study is absolute bullshit or you’re interpreting it wrong. 120h-144hz is *very* easily noticeable by the layperson in almost every circumstance. Some might not care about it but it’s absolutely noticeable and observable


Wouldn’t a portable monitor be significantly cheaper than getting an iPad ?


So you would agree that you're not extracting the value that you paid for it, correct?


Been taking my laptops into the bathroom since my first iBook in 2001.


lol what the heck? Pencil 1 or 2? Pencil 2 on iPad Air is flawless for me.


I never said it was useless. I said it's not worth the price for most people who already have a phone and a computer. If you do have a use case that justifies the price tag, then you're an exception. It's mindboggling how many people like you are trying so hard to misconstrue my original comment.


You can sideload emulators onto the iPad but you have to renew it weekly. Kinda sucks but it’s doable.


Burned by Samsung?

Galaxy Note 7?


they are trying didn't you see RE and AC? /S Apple is the biggest gaming company in the world, the vendors just realized they would make way more money with easy to run games with micro transactions than with AAA experiences.


You would still need devs to create for it. You aren’t replacing the switch because you’ve got AAA Nintendo titles. You aren’t replacing the Steam Deck until you have AAA PC titles. 

Technically it might surpass those two devices. But not by user adoption.


A notch


Not much really. They're more useful than iPads (subjective if you use a platform-locked app) but nothing different from Samsung's own normal sized tablets.


Total things it can do yes, but maybe there are certain things this person wants that you need a touch screen or a pencil for. I think they probably knew about the existence of MacBooks before this thread lol


[deleted]


[deleted]


iPads are currently just larger iPhones with pencil capability. Better screens and speakers make for a more comfortable viewing experience for consuming media or browsing.

The real draw is the pencil being an excellent input device. If somehow it's dead or I've left it behind it actually feels awkward to putz around the OS - just second nature now. Not to mention it's really nice for written notes and drawings with lots of pressure levels.


The Pro models upgrade the experience and add 120hz, Thunderbolt, and M1 for more connectivity and power.


It's a vocal minority. They complain because they're upset and want to see XYZ in the products Apple sells. The majority have their needs met, don't particularly care, and don't have much to say on the topic.

Thus, you get a lot of loud, pointed complaints about niche issues that have little impact in the wider market.


I don't know what you think is so crazy about a product line that already exists getting a CPU with 30% better multithreaded performance (that they've put into Air models) and a better microcontroller for faster transfer speeds. Most of the R&D and software optimization for either would be already complete so it's just a minor parts cost.


This also is just my opinion on something I think is reasonable & would appreciate. A little smoother Lightroom performance, ability to connect to a secondary monitor & have the display fit dimensions via stage manager, and a little faster I/O performance for backups are overall minor things that would improve my experience.


Yeah, I had an iPad mini and liked it but for my actual use the 11" Pro that replaced it was a huge step up

I’m very curious what academic study backs up your claims? I provided mine.


Why would I spend money on a portable monitor that I would only use occasionally when I can have an iPad that I can use every day


I think it’s been great value, especially during Covid, since portability hasn’t been a concern. $649 11” iPad Pro, 4 years old. Every iPad OS update has near full support and adds new useful features. I pretty much always have it in a stand on my desk in landscape mode and I use it most days for media consumption. The latest feature with widgets helps me control the lights in my office straight from the lockscreen without digging into a menu. I use it for SideCar occasionally but only on my personal MacBook, so it’s not something I depend on. 

You could say, yeah, pretty bad value for a portable monitor if I don’t use it. But as a whole package, I’d say it’s just about right and I’d do it again. People will happily drop $649 on a TV but for some reason, $649 on Apple’s creative/productivity tool that turns into a portable home TV looks like a waste of money to them.


These days you can get USB-C portable monitors for like $300 that do what Sidecar does, minus the pencil input, but for any device with HDMI.


You said:

> it covers a middle ground that doesn't really need to exist for most people

Aka useless. 

It’s mind boggling that you’re trying to walk back what you said. But tell me, why do you think tablets are so popular if they’re useless for most people?

Sent from my iPad


Most no longer work properly on i(Pad)OS 17, the old way of enabling JIT was removed.


Nope, buy a developer account and then its renew once a year


It’s an older reference sir, but it checks out


Care to show me these iPad Air 4th generation for £200.


Well you’ve only had it for a few hours if you’ve had it since lunch


Would you consider upgrading by supper time?

I don’t know about you, but I would really like to play Angry Birds at 240 FPS.


Oh, I’m sure that’s true. Neither of us do art on our — we’re both musicians so the refresh rate (which doesn’t make a difference for consuming media content) isn’t very noticeable.


I just read the study and it’s painfully obvious you didn’t. It’s stating that the maximum noticeable one frame flicker is 50-90 hz and a perceived “stable” picture with no interruptions. It has literally nothing to do with perceived smoothness

The general population makes it very clear you’re wrong. The study says you’re wrong too. Have you even looked at a 120hz+ screen yourself before? It’s an incredibly obvious phenomenon to observe. People wouldn’t be raving about promotion screens, 120 hz wouldn’t be the standard for nice screens and tvs if people could only observe up to 90hz.

It’s painfully obvious you’re


Because you said sidecar is the only productivity you are doing on it and it will be available for 1/3rd of the price


my guy, FOR MOST PEOPLE. Learn how to read.


AltStore still works for me


Well TIL. That's some shit, but I'm not surprised.

It not like they're wrong about the complaints. It's just good to keep in mind that just because a point is valid doesn't mean it's a particularly widespread complaint. Aka, just because you see it posted on /r/Apple doesn't automatically mean it's a common ask from Apple's consumer base.

It's a bit of a reddit issue in general, /r/Android has the same problem with headphone jacks. Yes, it's a valid complaint, but the market at large doesn't care about the issue as much as they wish it did.


Give me 720 FPS for angry birds and the M2 Ultra chip power for my third party calculator app please


I have a 14 pro.. yes I noticed the screen is more responsive than my 12 mini. But i have also seen 260 and it was the same to me as 120. I assume that means i fall in the 90-ish frame rate. I can tell when it’s higher than 60 but not grater than 120hz.

(Before you go off that i have no idea what im talking about.. i’m a software engineer currently working with navida’s next gen graphics cards) specs are specs people chase and will make them buy the latest and greatest hardware but real world perception matters more when making mass market products.

If you can’t tell when a frame is flickering then you also can’t tell it changed ever so slightly :)


iPads are not just productivity devices


Oh my...the irony. It’s like you either didn’t or couldn’t read my last comment. I literally quoted you as saying “most people”. 🤦‍♂️


AltStore itself still works for sideloading apps, but you can't run more recent emulators like Dolphin untethered.


Yes but if your willing to compromise on 'new' then that should be a compromise applied equally in which case the gap doesn't narrow.

£300 for an Air 4 vs £200 for a Duet 3.


What is Apple doing with the iPad line up? 

This new iPad has USB C but only supports Apple Pencil Gen 1, so you need the adapter. It also gets a landscape camera and new keyboard with a shortcut row, neither of which come to the new Pro models. Also what is the point of getting an iPad Air now? Just for the M1 chip? Very confusing.


Wow that pricing is terrible. I can get a 9th gen iPad today for $259.99 and the 10th gen starts at $449.99 lol


I don’t understand. The appeal of the original iPad is the price point. And now it’s just as expensive as the upper tier iPads


>	A new USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is required for pairing and charging and is included in the box with a new version of Apple Pencil (1st generation). For existing owners of Apple Pencil (1st generation), the USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is sold separately.

I’m shocked that the already clunky Pencil 1 experience is being made even clunkier with a lightning to USB C adapter.

I’d really not recommend this for anyone looking to use the pencil at all.


Honestly the USB-C adaptor for the Gen 1 Pencil has to be the stupidest thing ive seen in a while


They could've AT LEAST added in support for the damn Apple Pencil 2 if they're shipping it with a USB-C port…smh, that's a dumb move and basically just encourages more people to spend that extra bit of extra cash and  get an iPad Air instead (which I'm sure was their intention from the start)


It doesn't support Apple Pen 2 and you need a fucking adaptor for the pen? 

WHAT????


>	Wi-Fi models of the new iPad are available with a starting price of $449

Damn, pretty big price jump from the $329 of the 9th Gen

Edit: For anyone in the UK there’s also been huge price increases across the whole iPad lineup. 9th Gen iPad is £369 (up from £319), new iPad is £499, Mini is £569 (up from £479), Air is £669 (up from £569), 11-inch Pro is £899 (up from £749), 12.9 inch Pro is £1249 (up from £999)


Well that price jump was ... Unexpectedly high


[deleted]


$449, no pencil 2 support. Wow.


Yikes, the new starting price almost kills it’s appeal as the budget iPad that most can just buy.


Well, that was underwhelming


Darn, that price jump is kinda harsh.

I wonder where this leaves the iPad Air tho. It’s overlapping with it both in price and design now, and the Air doesn’t have enough differentiating features.

Edit: Also, Apple Pencil 1 support only? That’s… Weird as heck.


No fully laminated display or antireflective coating.


It doesn’t support the second-gen Apple Pencil?

[EDIT: Jfc lol](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MQLU3AM/A/usb-c-to-apple-pencil-adapter) Instead of being able to charge it from the iPad, that’s just not an option anymore. Horrible idea


What in the world? A price hike of $120, yet still no support for the new Apple Pencil? Worse still, it only supports the original Apple Pencil which, thanks to its lightning connector, can’t even be charged by the iPad anymore without an adapter?

>Apple Pencil (1st generation) is compatible with the new iPad. A new USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is required for pairing and charging and is included in the box with a new version of Apple Pencil (1st generation) for $99 (US)

What in god’s name were they thinking?


$449 for 64GB of storage? Come on…


This is the strangest Apple launch in a while to me. 

New base iPad is more expensive (boo), but features a much better-centered front camera and a keyboard with a function row (huzzah!), BUT only supports the old Apple Pencil and requires a dongle to use it? And the new iPad Pro has a great screen and processor, but the front camera is still off to the side and its keyboard does NOT have a function row. 

There's no "best of the best" option. Very un-Apple.


FYI 9th gen still being sold at the same price.  
Also I would guess this has USB 5Gbps (aka 3.2gen1 or whatever) since the specs aren't specific


This will probably be the biggest product bomb since as far back as I can remember. This is way to expensive of a jump for the base model and the air is far better of a value. Most people will just hold out until the product line gets fixed or go with the a cheaper gen 9 one or air if they really need to upgrade.

Edit: The pen situation is idiotic.


[deleted]


What a bizzare update. The pricing is insane. The idea of a 64GB base storage SKU in current year is bonkers. At that price point you'd expect at least M1 but it's A14. The handling of the apple pencil is atrocious.

What a huge disappointment. I'll just wait for an air to go on sale.


don’t see why anyone would get this over the air


Clear pass at that price point.


£499 for base 64GB iPad, HAHAHAHAHA.

Also Air got a £100 price bump.

Good luck selling any.


Lol did they really fix the camera for the iPad 10 but not the new iPad Pro? Price raised to $449 for 64 Gbs though - gonna have to think a bit more about this vs a new air.


Apple really turning on the heat with the pricing.

What no competition does to a mf.


so you have to connect your usb-c cable to the ipad that connects to the adapter that connects to the apple pencil. make it make sense.


[deleted]


“Completely redesigned”


How does Apple still sells anything with 64GB base storage. Jesus christ.


Intentionally crippled by Apple to not support the Pencil 2.

The original iPad Pro supports it and only has an A9X chip. This new iPad has the A14.


This might be the dumbest product apple has ever released. I’d rather buy a refurb iPad Air 4 that has Apple Pencil 2 support. Tf is this


Apple Pencil 1 support is a bizarre and interesting move.


No Laminated Screen, No Anti reflective coating, No Apple Pencil 2 support, extreme price increase, big fail by apple


Ouch at that price increase. The new basic iPad is a pretty decent upgrade, but with that price it’s so close to iPad Air territory.

The biggest appeal of the basic iPad was just to have an iPad experience at the lowest price.


Pffft, I would've considered the 10th generation but not at that fucking price. They're smoking some whacky shit. £499 base and increased the price of every other iPad? No thanks.


Only 1st gen Apple Pencil support? Are they mad?


This genuinely baffles me to see the base Ipad has a (1) price increment, furthering making it inaccessible for the masses (2) an outdated 2 year old bionic chip (3) a usb C connector with a lightning connector pencil. Poor execution and consideration for this year model.

I get it, it’s a base iPad - but Jesus Christ absolutely no empathy being placed in “redesigning” the base model. 

The 9 minute video showcase an extremely minor yet petty update (I dare say on all models) that they themselves knows it isn’t worth considering to have a proper recorded keynote.  

I’m sorry but this release is just utterly disappointing and underwhelming.

Edit ; typo.


£499 in the UK???? Wow


Re-designed? Look like iPad mini ate a super mushroom to me. And the price jump. Damn.


This iPad is possibly the worst thought-out product I've seen from Apple in a *while.*

* Why would you switch to the modern flat-edged design but not include Apple Pencil 2 support?
* If you're going to keep Apple Pencil 1 support, why would you switch to USB-C?
* Why would you change the dimensions *ever so slightly,* breaking compatibility with existing keyboard folios?
* Why would you make a new keyboard folio... that is broken in two?
* How can you justify things like a non-laminated screen, sRGB over P3, etc., at this price point?

It makes no sense because this iPad is worse in basically every regard compared to the iPad Air 4. 

***Why not re-release the iPad Air 4 with minor updates like Center Stage, and call it iPad?***

That would fix basically every problem that I can see with this iPad.

It's *baffling* that this product made it out of the brainstorm phase.


So bittersweet. The design-update I hoped for and the price hike I feared. The real dealbreaker is the Apple Pencil 1 with this ridiculous dongle. The Pencil 1 is such a sh*t design and I can’t believe they go through such lengths to stuff it up our a$$.


This is by far the worst product upgrade they've had in YEARS.


I hate the 64GB or 256GB storage gap. No 128GB option, just forcing people to spend more.


Finally, good riddance to the badly designed iPad pencil v1…

Oh wait, it still uses the v1 pencil?

And now you need a usb-c adaptor for it to make it an even more finicky collection of small loose-able parts?

At least it’s cheap…

Wait, it starts at £500 in the UK??

What are they smoking there at Apple. I will even defend the harpooned Magic Mouse charging, and the slow/inconsistent move to Usb-c, but there is supply chain re-use shit going on that’s making the products appreciably worse at this point.

If you spend almost £600 for this and a pencil v1 at this point in 2022you are getting a bum deal. That pencil needs eviscerated from the lineup. Spend the overhead money to make all iPads use pencil v2 ffs.


Jesus Christ the price is ridiculous. And then to add insult to injury, they've increased the price of every other iPad? What fucking bullshit is this? £500 for a 64gb iPad lmao. Guess I'll buy a android tablet instead, this sucks


Non laminated, srgb, support for apple pencil 1 only, and only with an adapter. 590€ for the 64gb version.


I’m sorry… how much... just shy of £500 for the cheapest iPad? That’s an increase of 34% on the 9th gen model in the UK

Goodbye Apple, it was fun while it lasted.


449 for a non laminated display, no p3 color, and no second gen apple pencil support. Is this a joke?


Apple’s pricing for their devices has gotten idiotic lately.


An sRGB, 60Hz, non-laminated display for nearly $500 in 2022 is beyond unacceptable.

I really hope the pixel tablet takes off and gives Apple some serious competition, cuz this entire iPad lineup is way overpriced and under spec’d.


super weird from apple. they bumped up the price and now lost the differentiation with the ipad air. This doesn't support gen 2 pencil so you have to buy an adapter and it has a landscape camera but the new pros don't? 11" still doesn't have mini led either. I don't understand what apple is doing at this point. Tbh if promotion wasn't an ipad pro thing I would've bought the cheapest ipad possible.


No wonder they did a simple press release. The 1st Gen Pencil and price jump would be annihilated live


Price hike is crazy i bought new ipad air 4 last year for the same price in my country as this ipad


[deleted]


Whoever approved the final design of the 10th iPad needs to be taken around back.

- USB-C and 1st gen Apple Pencil so it needs a dongle
- Different POGO pin location so it does not support the iPad Air and Pro’s keyboards
- $130 price increase
- Still just 64GB of storage


[removed]


Pricing is fucked. Older model prices have **gone up** by 8-10% in India.

Madness.


>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today introduced the new iPad (9th generation), featuring the powerful A13 Bionic chip that packs even more performance and capability into the most popular iPad, all while retaining its all-day battery life.^1 Starting at **just £319**, the new iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display with True Tone, a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Centre Stage, support for Apple Pencil (1st generation) and Smart Keyboard, the intuitive iPadOS 15, and twice the storage of the previous generation. The new iPad is available to order beginning today on apple.com/uk, and in stores beginning Friday, September 24.

#

The new iPad 10^th gen starts at £499 for the same store.

Oof.

And their European price is €579

Again base model, wi-fi, 64GB.

Also charging €10 for the USB-C pencil adaptor.

Let's add it iup

iPad 64GB €579

Apple Pencil €119

Apple Pencil adaptor €10

Apple Folio Keyboard €299

Total: €1007


These European prices are insane... oh and to get 256GB of storage that's... another €200.

For the UK it's slightly better at £896 (€1,029.10)


Lmao they kept the 9th gen around but with a $50 price increase too


I like the look of that magic folio keyboard, though. I would love if it worked with the Air 4. I have the folio keyboard at the moment, but this just looks a bit better.


Still uses the 1st generation Apple Pencil…

Edit how are you meant to charge and pair it if it’s a usb c port?


Ah was looking forward to buyibg one but guess ill pass..


As someone due an upgrade, this is just a baffling product.


No support for second gen pencil, higher base price, no real reason to upgrade... Giving this a pass for now. Pretty shocking.


Between this nonsense and the M2 "Pros" I'm really starting to wonder if Apple actually know wtf they want to do with iPads.


Stupidest thing apple has ever released. Apple is truly going downhill with their crazy pricing and stupid adapters.


You'd have to be pretty stupid to get this over the iPad Air. So expensive for old processors and an even older Apple Pencil. Plus dongle city. 

Just why? Why did apple waste all their time and resources making this junk?


Old Apple Pencil

Non laminated display

No P3 Wide Color support….

Why does this exist?


This artificial segmentation is a mess and extremely anti-consumer of Apple. The colors are nice and it's wonderful to see USB-C come to the entire iPad line, but for fucks sake just drop the Air. I love my air but at this point it has absolutely no home in the lineup, especially with prices like this. Why is the mini more expensive than the normal?? Why can I buy a gen 4 Air or a 2018 Pro for 10-30 dollars more??? Why are we still wasting time, money, plastic, and energy for the stupid fucking first gen pencil??????? It feels like Apple's forgotten their customer's needs and are intentionally trying to get people to shell out a little more for the Air or the mini. It's exhausting.


Ok which one of you asked for a redesigned base IPad on a monkeys paw?


>completely redesigned

As in “device we sold you 2 years ago but now without some of its features”?

I mean, I like this design, and you could’ve called it “completely redesigned” if the only other iPad was iPad Pro, but it’s  just a reissued 2020 iPad Air without the support of gen2 Pencil and a proper keyboard. 

That’s not a redesign, it’s not even a new device


The real shocker for me is that the 9th gen is now being sold for £369 when it launched last year at £319! I know US dollar has strengthened a lot lately but I thought Apple usually discounts older gens when debuting the new model, but here it seems that this 10th gen is just slotting between the old iPad and the iPad Air in terms of pricing instead.

The Apple Store specs list confirms this new iPad lacks a laminated display, which is kinda disappointing considering the price jump to £499 in my opinion.

Edit: looks like iPad Air also went up in price. £669 vs £569 previously. Ouch.


The lack of compatibility with the second generation Apple Pencil is a weird omission.


I was excited to buy one but no Gen 2 Apple Pencil support and price increase has me reconsidering.


I hope this sells terribly. This sucks


At $450 and everything it’s lacking is doa for me.


This is like a mishmash of everything Apple offers lmao. You got a non-laminated display with the iPad Air/Pro design with USB-C but gen 1 Apple Pencil?


The European prices are INSANE. I maxed out an iPad Pro for fun and it came down to almost 4k euros.


Gen 1 Pencil and USB-C. Gotta buy an adapter. So much for the e-waste propaganda… lol


How does the ipad mini support the 2nd gen pencil but not the newest base ipad??


Holy shit. 36% price jump?  Wow.


Nah, screw this. This original Apple Pencil is 7 years old now. It’s beyond outdated and the fact you need an adapter to charger the pencil contradicts their environmental bs.


Spend another $20 and get a new 4th gen Air from Walmart. This thing is a waste of money.


$449..when an air is regularly on sale $499-519, has an m1 and gen 2 pencil support.

This is an oddball release. The whole point of the old form factor iPads is that you could get one for $299


“The stunning 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display extends to the edges…”

Uh no it doesn’t. Those bezels are massive.


Magic Keyboard Folio is so much better than the regular magic keyboard imo


Base ipad Display is still not laminated.

This is just grim at this point.


“completely redesigned” 
lol ok sure


I’ve always wanted an iPad in bad piss yellow


>	A new USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is required for pairing and charging and is included in the box with a new version of Apple Pencil (1st generation). For existing owners of Apple Pencil (1st generation), the USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is sold separately.

Seems weird


These new prices 😬. Air now starts at £669!


They could have just used the iPad Air 3 chassis for a slightly bigger display and called it a day. But no, they have to make a dumbed down iPad Air and jack up the price. This makes no sense.


Feels like they’re moving towards a more simple iPad / iPad Pro dual tiers, similar to the iPhone. Been a messy few years with the iPad Air but if they drop it, there’s a much clearer gap between the available models. And as the base iPad models get older, that fills out the low end, same as the iPhone.


They made an umbilical usb-Cord for the pencil lol


The price hike is very unfortunate, especially in Europe. I could get Air 5 at the same price before markets update their pricing. But I'd probably just go with refurbish Air 4? It's cheaper, with laminated display and pen 2 support.


Those look a lot like the iPod touch 5th generation colors


$100 price hike??? Apple Pencil 1 only??? Hardddddd pass.


Why would anyone buy this over an iPad Mini 6 which frequently goes on sale for $399?


A cheaper iPad Air but still starts at 64GB. I know it’s leaned towards education but I think it’s time for the 128GB baseline models


I'm flabbergasted Apple differentiated on some extra magnets and Apple Pencil 2 support. What a ridiculous product jumble. There's no need for so many iPad product lines -- iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad, and iPad mini. The money's good, I'm sure, but it's too messy and chaotic for my OCD brain -- especially the iPad and iPad Air.


Is this how Apple wants to attract new customers?


Well, we all know now why they did this as press release and not during an event...


[deleted]


The new Apple TV has a better chip than the new iPad


It's cheaper to get an M1 MacBook Air than a 256GB iPad 10th gen and the folio, and it's a much better product unless you need to draw on the screen (with a first gen Pencil lol). More RAM, better keyboard, better battery life, MacOS/apps, more connectivity.

An iPad Air 4th gen is a better buy if you can find one and don't need centre stage, it has a laminated screen, gen2 pencil support, and likely more ram.


Requiring the 1st gen Apple Pencil is a huge miss


I was excited for the new one, but $450 for an iPad without Apple Pencil 2 support is just dumb. I wish they kept the home button for this one so I wouldn't have to spend *that* much on an iPad. Either I will get the 9th gen for a low price, or wait until Black Friday to see if the 10th gens will go down in price.


Nobody hates iPad owners more than Apple.


€599 (after sales tax) starting price here in the EU. They’ve basically priced themselves out of the European market. People are worried about getting food on the table and have enough money left over to pay bills. Not many people are willing to shell out that kind of money on a tablet.


It's like the Franken-iPad, just in time for Halloween!

* The design language of the Pro
* The non-laminated display of the old iPad
* USBC
* Only supports the Pencil 1, with an ugly adapter
* Wacky pricing (though I suppose that's *everything* these days...)

Did they just say "Hey, with the parts shortage, what kinds of stuff do we just have a lot of hanging around?  Can we cobble that into something?"


Baffling decision by apple to not support the second gen Apple Pencil. what the actual fuck lmao. This might be the dumbest decision I have ever seen by apple.


Insane price jump and almost the same as an iPad air in my country. They messed up with this one.

Price jumped by USD 218 in my country, from the last iPad. That's pretty wild.


This is a joke lol


Everytime I start looking to come back into the Apple ecosystem they do something horrifically stupid and/or unnecessarily greedy...  
* **50% increase** in base iPad cost (Australia, $500 to $750), still starts at 64gb
* pencil v1 support only & requires stupid adapter bs
* smart connector *arbitrarily* in different location breaking iPad Pro/Air keyboard case compatibility

At least the ATV is cheaper, but the omission of Eth & Thread on the 64gb model is again baffling. Saving pennies??  
Bloody over Tim by this point; so many little things that keep building up with each release. It was this sorta stuff that pushed me away years ago.


To this day I have no idea what "liquid retina" I supposed to say. "Retina" was a resolution where nobody needs to go any higher because that's the resolution of the retina! And then it's just...liquid? Buzzwords where they are not needed screams Apple


is this kinda like OW2


Holy shit this costs £500 ($565)

Apple currently sells refurbished 2018 iPad Pros for £400 lmao


Non-laminated display for $449 is such a fucking L


And it costs $600 in Sweden.....

Apple can take their shiny new thick-bezel iPad, and shove it...!!


Still with the old Apple Pencil, wtf. That thing *needs to die*


In Germany the price increases are insane and can't be explained by the weak Euro completely.


£500?! For the base model of the basic iPad... Wtf. Currently a no brainer to get the Air for £570 instead but that might not last long with Apple bumping it's RRP up by £100 today too.

The basic iPad used to be decent value for the money but not at £500, that's just nuts.


Keeping the 1st Gen Pencil and old Smart Connector makes what should be a triumphant redesign into one of the dumbest products they’ve made in a while.

Should have killed the Air and simplified the line up to Mini / iPad / iPad Pro, all using the same pencil and keyboard/case ecosystem


God I love it when the release new products that dont make me want to replace my perfectly fine ones. 2018 iPad Pro 11” lives another year!


The UK price has increased by 50% for the base iPad! 329 to 499


A goddamn travesty with a ridiculous price.


The 40% price increase from AUD $499 to $699 is just crazy


Am I really the only one that hates the protruding cameras? I just want my device to lay flat on the table without the cover. Apparently that is too much to ask for


This whole thing is just baffling. It used to be that when someone asked me what I would recommend for a cheap laptop I would tell them to just buy an iPad. When the iPad was $429 CAD it wasn’t too much of a jump compared to the cheap Windows laptops and Chromebooks, but far more performant. Now at $600 CAD? I won’t be recommending that anymore.

Why does this not support the second gen Apple Pencil? Even the MINI supports it. The mini. If the reason is that this supporting the new Pencil would make the Air less appealing that just means that the iPad Air should not exist.

Also that new folio keyboard. It is over $100 more expensive than the Logitech equivalent and is less protective. Also only useful for this one iPad. Also looks to be made from the same material as the other folio products and the Magic Keyboard for the Pro/Air. Isn’t that material notorious for not lasting? I had the Magic Keyboard very briefly because I returned it in a week due to how delicate it felt to lug around. I guess it has an escape key. That’s cool.


Are we not going to talk about the colors? They’re so ugly…


>	completely redesigned 

Narrator: it wasn’t


YAWN


They are delusional. Everyone up there has too much money , to them this shit is cheap.


Lol "Innovation"


Apple used to have a few products that were all great. Now they are going with the firehose approach that killed so many hardware companies, reduce quality in exchange for more bogus choices.


Apple is the new GM. Do you want a Chevy, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, or Cadillac? The new iPad is the Pontiac Aztec for sure! (For those that want a fancy brand on the base model undercarriage!)


Am I missing something? No one else is mentioning it.

The commercial said, more than once, that iPad has an “all screen design”. Is there not a huge bezel around the entire screen?!?! I feel like I’m going crazy. 

How does a screen extend “right to the edges” when there is like a 1/3rd inch bezel?


Time to retire the 1st gen pencil. This iPad is very disappointing.


Completely redesigned had me expecting a circle instead of a rectangle.


I miss Jobs.


Redesigned? Still looks like an iPad to me.


Why does anyone care what color the iPad is when you immediately put it in a case? Why is that always the selling point?


600$ for an entry level iPad in Europe.

That’s a pretty dang courageous decision!

(Especially when it has virtually no new features except for a two year old iPad Air 4 CPU.)


now available in piss yellow 😳


Reskinned iPad Air 4th Generation.


artificial segmentation to differentiate it in some way from the air.


They should just drop the Air at this point


Yeah lmao what a mess.

But maybe if you view it as a cheap iPad option with no support for Apple Pencil at all, it makes more sense? And if you really want the Pencil you can make do with the old one


I think for only 80 more on Amazon, I’d get an iPad Air over this for the m1.


They need to just combine the air line with the 11” pro at this point.

This new iPad has Liquid Retina, landscape camera, and a 10.9” screen. $449

The air has m1, gen 2 pencil support, a 10.9” screen, and Liquid Retina. $599

The 11” pro is basically an air with a teensy bit larger screen, pro motion, and 4 speakers. For $799. There’s nothing about the pro at this point that makes it $200 better than an air or $349 better than this new iPad. The m1 in these devices are like putting a supercharger on a v8 but governing the speedo to 40mph

The 12.9” is the only one that really feels like a premium device nowadays as nothing else is as big and it has the mini LED screen.


The 2022 iPad doesn’t support Stage Manager but a 2018 iPad does. Wut


They offer four different keyboard cases now… wow


I can't be the only one thinking this crap with the Gen 1 pencil needing an adapter is like some sort of malicious compliance with the new EU chargers law? I seriously hope they get raked over the coals for this one, it's not good enough IMO.


If you're in the market for this tier of device then just get the 9th gen. You won't regret it.


Yup. I'm getting the 9th gen after seeing the prices.


Yup, I got mine for $270 last month and was a bit nervous I'd regret it once the 10th gen came out.

Nope.  Just a standard upgrade in a new chassis that makes Pencil support even more of a PITA while chucking out compatibility with a long list of third-party keyboards/cases.  Oh, and an absolutely massive price increase that would have killed any interest in getting one anyway.

(Also honestly I like the Home Button on my iPad anyway.  Sure the chin is ugly but it's so much easier than swiping up since my finger hovers over it anyway, same with touch ID.)


It’s even crazier here in Europe. You can get the 9th new on sale for 329€ and the new one is f*ng 599€… I was waiting for the 10th, but nah, just gonna get 9th now.


Solution? They increased the price of the upper tier iPads by over 20%!


And has apple pencil gen 1. 

Like this is the time for apple to standardize ipads to use same tools, but no they stray further from light


That pencil should have either been USB C or at least lightning female. Lightning male is incredibly stupid. Then we could just use a cable.


Agreed. One needs to look at this as an iPad update. If the Pencil is needed one should look at a different model.


This alone makes it basically unusable if you want to illustrate. Like wtf


I was ready to buy this thing until I saw the Pencil situation. Even though I don't use a Pencil all that often the Pencil 1 is so clunky to use that I'm just pissed off.


This is a whole new level of lazy on Apple's part.


> I’d really not recommend this for anyone looking to use the pencil at all.

Which is exactly how Apple wants it.  On previous gens the Pencil 1, clunky as it is and despite the air gap with the display, worked well-enough for anyone who just needed it to take notes or something.  Now they've added an extra cumbersome layer to the experience to encourage people to just get the Air if you're going to use a Pencil at all.


> I’d really not recommend this for anyone looking to use the pencil at all.

Which is fine, because the vast majority of iPad users (all models) have no interest in Apple Pencil. Those buying the cheapest entry level iPad model almost certainly don’t want one.


What if I occasionally use the pencil for light notetaking in the notes app, and annotating PDFs, and basically nothing else?  

Also, I already have a first gen pencil for my pro 2.


I am blown away that they moved to USB-C and a new design and didn't do Pencil 2 support. What the fuck.

And the Smart Connector is still side-mounted so no compatibility with the newer keyboard folios either.


I'm honestly dumbfounded. The only thing I can think of is that Apple has so many 1stgen Apple Pencils in storage that they have to sell as many as possible.


I'm an Apple fanboy and yeah this is ridiculous.


Apple: “we care about the environment and hate eWaste.” Straight up lol


Wait does it even support the Apple Pencil 2?


I was contemplating getting it, but between no Apple Pencil 2 support and the adapter for 1, I'm out.  I don't even use the Pencil that much, but my 4 year old iPad does everything this one can do.  They literally offered no incentive for me to upgrade lol.


Egregiously ugly posturing from Apple on that decision. 

Either let it use a 2nd gen pencil or give it native USB-C :(


What the fuck, crazy they didn’t do apple pencil 2 support……. like it blows my mind


I thought that someone at The verge has made a mistake when I read gen 1 pencil. Wtf is happening that they’re just doing dumb stuff like this and thinking we won’t notice.


I was getting geared up to buy this and replace my aging 6th gen and pencil but not now. I figured it would cost a little more and was will to pay that but now it’s just not the right combo. I see no reason for me to buy this. I rather get a Air now or honestly just get a 9th gen. Disappointing.


Even an iPad mini is better which regularly starts at $450 and has a superior A15 and pencil 2 support. This is one bizarre release…


Speaking for myself, this shitshow just encouraged me to pass on this iPad generation altogether.


wide include snatch existence scarce observation psychotic reminiscent cough offend ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `


It’s literally an upgraded air 4. I checked spec for spec. They must have kept out the magnet to keep price down and make them more money.


I wonder if the pencil 1 and the adapter combined make it now compatible with usb c iPads?


Yeah plus no magnets for the 2nd gen Apple Pencil. I think I’d spend the extra for the Air if I was going to use this for drawing or notes.


Yikes, those are some horrendous price increases.


€650 starting price for the lowest Wifi-only 64 GB model in the EU. Yiiiiikes.


[deleted]


All that results from screwing the value is I buy less of their stuff. But apparently they’re ok with that.


Somehow Europe managed to get fucked **EVEN** more.


With Sterling in the gutter, it's hardly unexpected.


Holy shit, those price jumps are fucking insane for literally zero new features


That price jump knocks a huge part of the market out of consideration IMO.

At $329, it was just cheap enough to consider vs Amazon Fire tablets for kids, older parents and really anyone that just wanted a bigger screened media device.

At $449, forget it.  It is back to being just for tech enthusiasts.


Yea, I’m surprised they didn’t go 399


They always seem to use form factor changes to justify price hikes.

Look at the 20% price hike on the Macbook Air when it got thinner bezels with M2.


And that’s still for 64GB base storage (256 for the upgrade). They could have softened the blow by giving the base model a more usable 128GB.

Edit: I’m starting to think they wanted to replace the iPad 9th gen in the lineup, but inflation and current economics made it impossible to match the price, so now they have to keep the old one around as the low cost option.


DOA, might as well just get an Air


[deleted]


**€599** base price in Europe vs **€360** for 9th gen, straight up reserved a 9th gen. to replace my mum's original iPad air (which still works sans updates).


$679 base in Singapore. Ridiculous.


Compatible only with the Gen 1 Apple Pencil and requires a USB-C to female lightning adapter to charge.


How are we going to charge the pencil??!! It has usb c. Or do they expect people to buy another pencil that has a usb c tip


I'm guessing they want schools and companies to keep using the same gen 1 pencil, but why not support pencil 2 as well so people can upgrade????


Yep, at that price you may as well save for another month and just get the Air. Read through the announcement only to finish with that.


It entirely kills it.

At £319 it was justifiable because that's still great value for money even if you don't use it to it's fullest. It's not shot up to £499.


This is what happens when they basically have no serious competition.


€599 here in Ireland. Over €1k if you pair it up with the pencil & keyboard. No fucking way is anybody with a bit of sense dropping that sort of money on a base model iPad. 

Idk what Apple's strategy is in Europe lately but shafting us with these insane prices is just going to drive an already large Android/Samsung market even more in that direction.


The most baffling part is that they know this and are still selling the 9th gen iPad for $329…

I really don’t understand the point of this new iPad? It seems to occupy a spot in the lineup that didn’t need to be filled. Was anyone looking for something that’s worse than an Air but also hardly any better than the base iPad, all for an extra $120? 

At this point they need to discontinue either the Air or the 11” Pro. Three ~11” iPads, each with different pros and cons, seems rather unnecessary. The current lineup is a mess.


still shocked the ipad mini costs more than the ipad.


No wonder they didn't have an event


I figured they would at least keep the base iPad at stereo speakers to differentiate, but no it’s quad. Way too much overlap with the iPad Air, which overlaps with the Pro since both run M1.

Apple’s iPad lineup gets wackier and wackier.


The Air is still more expensive and has M1 (whether is useful or not in iPadOS, that’s up to each user)


Non-laminated display again. Sigh


It definitely fills a void in the stair step.  "Oh I want an iPad, $300 isn't so bad.  Oh it's $330, oh and it's the old one.  Oh the new one is just $120 more.  But hm, I want the best chip, not two years ago's chip.  So now $600.  Oh, 64GB of storage isn't much fr a $600 device, better bump that.  Ya know, at $750 I'd like it to basically be a laptop, let me get that keyboard.  Oh shit I've spent a grand."


air will sell because its basically the cheapest ipad for anyone taking notes or drawing (which i assume a significant share of people), i cant see anyone getting first gen pencil in 2022


Apple Pencil 2 support + magnets is a big difference imo


Wow.. I’m almost offended at how terrible this iPad is for $449


$450 and the screen look like a budget device due to not being laminated.

Apple is pinching pennies and its going to kill sales


Oddly enough I was on-board with “upgrading” to this up until that point. I can’t stand the display gap on non-laminated. Even the Mini 6 got laminated


It has usbc but first gen Pencil?  Wha?

>* Apple Pencil (1st generation) is compatible with the new iPad. A new USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is required for pairing and charging and is included in the box with a new version of Apple Pencil (1st generation) for $99 (US).
* For existing owners of Apple Pencil (1st generation), the USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is sold separately for $9 (US).

Hmm, will this adapter also allow pairing the old Apple Pencil to other USBC iPads? 🤔


Nope. Still supports the 1st gen Pencil. To connect it, you need a $9 adapter


Nope, I was gonna get this if it did…sigh


That’s a massive let down. Apple Pencil 1st gen to 2nd is basically a convenience upgrade, no reason why it shouldn’t had been added for this iPad.


>	What in god’s name were they thinking?

$$$$


As if plugging the Pencil into the iPad to charge it wasn't stupid enough. Now you even need an adapter. Apple does stupid decisions every now and then.


[deleted]


It’s not even the base iPad. The 9th is still being offered.


Yeah right now 9th gen is on sale at a bunch of places probably anticipating a replacement, but I assume they'll be going back to the normal price soon enough.


It’s got a price increase in the eu lol


This will be the model they give the most aggressive discounts from 3rd party retailers as well as be used in enterprise and education settings.


https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-10th-gen,ipad-air-4th-gen

-	new iPad has better camera (12MP vs 7MP)
-	new iPad does *not* have laminated display 
-	new iPad supports 1st Gen pencil (not 2nd)
-	new iPad can be spec’d with 5G

Basically, don’t buy this. Just buy a 4th Gen Air if you can find one.

edit: looks like they're keeping the 9th gen around as well so this is essentially just an "iPad Air SE" in everything but name.


colors and the pencil lol


The M1 was based on the A14 architecture, so not that huge of a difference. And Apple is still selling the M1 iPad Air so they probably didn’t want this to cannibalise those sales. I guess the logic here is, since it’s a cheaper model, they might as well reuse components for the older devices they are still selling, (iPhone 12 processor), without making it seem *too* appealing of a buy for those interested in the power that the M1 would offer.


That’s the point. Apple wants you to buy the air.


12.9” got a £250 bump 😭


They'll probable sell okay-ish, not the blow out success that they have been at £319 but decently.

However I suspect people will be looking a lot closer at Android tablets which have been nearly the same in price (for a decent one) with the price increase that means they are now substantially cheaper.

Lenovo Ideapad Duet 3 £349

iPad (previously) £319

While the Duet 3 came with a stylus (I think) and the keyboard the iPad was still competitive due to better OS.

Now the iPad is £499.

You are paying £150 more for less storage (Duet has 128GB), no keyboard, no stylus.


Thank god I bought my M1 Air when I did lmfao


Maybe the Pencil charging mechanism interferes with the camera? Most likely just a pricing issue though.


My experience with the Galaxy Tab s8 has been amazing. It’s a solid Android experience, and multi-window mode or split screen is great for attending lectures in teams and writing notes at the same time. Samsung’s Dex is a little clunky, but useful if you can make a spot in your workflow for it. 

It’s just a shame the price is so high, but compared to these iPads it’s a steal for what it is.


also that adapter isn't included


This price ladder is funny as hell.


[deleted]


cant believe the ipad mini supports it and not this ipad lmaooo

ipad mini lowkey a steal


A hard sell when you can get an Air 4 for cheaper.


And that storage upgrade is *steep*. $600 for 256, might as well get an Air at that point, or 128GB Pro, that’s what I’m going to do.


$750 or $1,000 AUD in Australia. So long budget option.


Yeah, prices are too crazy in Europe..

If you’re planing on getting one, I’ve some advices.

Last year I got the Air with the student discount for around 620€. They don’t check if you’re actually a student, at least not in Belgium and if they do, just buy it in the name of a student. They also gave AirPods with it, again for students, which I sold for 120€. I bought a 20€ pencil on Amazon which has worked without any issues for me, only downside is that I’ve to charge it with a cable and not with the iPad directly. Bought a cover from AliExpress for 8€. Today I just bought the Logitech Keys-To-Go keyboard from Logitech for 40€. So I spent around 570€ for my iPad in total.

I think buying cheaper accessories is worth it for people who aren’t ready to spend 1000€ on an iPad. It helped me a lot last year for uni and the 570€ I spent is totally worth it.


Yes I know the mini has the A15, but god dammit this lineup is still impossible to make excuses for.


Can someone let Tim Apple know that they don’t *have* to sell three or four different models of iPad? Like, they could have the Air, the Pros, and the Mini.


So basically they've run out of ideas on the pro and now every other model has to suffer


They should have made the air this. It has slightly more features.


they could've just dropped the air $100 and it'd be the same thing, but this is likely way cheaper to produce and thus a much larger profit margin. Surprise, surprise...


[deleted]


I have an 8th gen. It's able.to do everything I need it to do (mostly web surfing and streaming), it gets quite a lot of use. It was also significantly cheaper than the iPad air.

The new price point is a bit silly.


Same. I held off of the 9th gen thinking the 10th gen would be the same price, but it’s $200 more expensive….


Same. I just ordered a 9th gen on Amazon for 359€ before they raise the price. 

I was planning to get an air, considering that it has 8GB of RAM, the M1 chip, and the nice wide gamut laminated screen. I was just waiting to see what the iPad 10th gen was bringing to the table. 

Same non laminated screen as the 9th gen iPad, A14 chip at more than 500€? No thanks. On top of that, they've raised the European prices for the old models too. I could buy the iPad Air for 650 on Amazon. Now it's >700 on their site. The budget 9th gen iPad went from 379 to 439. 

I know there's inflation. I know the USD is very strong right now so foreign markets make less money at this moment. I don't care. That's not my problem. I refuse to pay extra for older models, or compromise for the new product that is way too expensive for a budget category, and yet too lower specced compared to the air. 

Well done apple. I assume that your top tier market analysis shows that you'll make more money by milking your loyal userbase. But I refuse to pay extra.


Absolutely I was holding off as well.
Well that seals it, going to get the 9th generation.

Tim is a logistical genius, but knee capping this 10th gen with support for only gen 1 pencil is incredible.

I was looking to get another iPhone for work in addition to current iPhone 12 than I realised no difference between iPhone 12 13 & 14 at the entry levels.

Having so many variants of iPhones is truly confusing and a bit waste.

Soon apple going to pull a Nokia India, where it is so successful in India that it destroys its own premium branding.


Same exact situation here. Was really worried the 10th generation was going to make me regret getting my 9th gen. Nope… couldn’t be happier with my decision hahaha


Wow, Tim Cook was not joking when he said we will love it! Now the new iPad seems really affordable compared to the upper tier iPad while still remaining their unique all screen design.


Apple Pencils do come with a lightning female to female adapter, but yeah, still dumb.


It should have included the magnets for the Pencil 2 like the Air, especially since the new iPad is basically just an Air.


The first gen Apple Pencil was a bad solution to a good idea. Gen 2 is great. Snaps in place magnetically, charges inductively. I had a 2018 iPad and pencil and it was horrible. No place to put it. 

So I bought a cover. It’s big and clunky. 

There’s an adapter for charging with a cable. 

There’s a cap that you can lose. 

And when you want to charge it - it sticks out of the iPad. If you use a cable there’s no place to put it where you’re not worried something will happen to it. And that’s even without kids in the house. 

I can see only reason they still make it and that’s stubbornness. They invested to make it and they’re going to keep making it so they can recoup that production line, and then some. 

But it’s a shitty product they should have killed off four years ago.


It’s calculated to not support the Pencil 2. If it did, there wouldn’t really be a reason to buy the Air over this. Though at this price point, there will be cannibalism of sales on one side.


It would literally just be an iPad Air at that point.


Is it possible the Pencil2 itself, and the components required on the iPad side for it, cost significantly more to manufacture? Like maybe 3 times more?  Honestly just asking, cause I’m surprised a Late 2022 iPad is launching with pencil 1 only support


You must remember there are a lot of schools that may have lots of Apple Pencils and iPads.


They are aiming the base model iPad at users who have no interest in Apple Pencil. Users who want Apple Pencil will probably buy the Air or Pro model.


A 9$ adapter is criminal. 

They’re selling a solution to the issue they’ve created intentionally in the first place. Fucking what.


It was always clear they were lying about that but people just ate it up because they felt it made them better people which is a thing apple fans really like feeling.


Just wait till you see just how not user serviceable and repairable all the newer iPhones are starting as way back as 2016 when they software locked hardware components even if the hardware was genuine apple manufactured hardware.


The amount of people who will accidentally buy 2nd Gen Pencils as companions for this iPad over the holidays is gonna be nuts.


No


nope it's the stupidest thing ever


It’s so insane.  I was forced to buy a 2nd gen pencil when I upgraded my ipad a couple years ago, now if I wanted to get this I’d have to rebuy a first gen pencil since I sold the old one.


Heck, I'd even say a better option is to go and get a refurbished iPad Air 4th generation.


Sometimes I ask myself will references to “Tim Apple” ever NOT be funny? 

No. They will not.


> The fucking balls on Tim Apple.

LOL! Totally stealing this.


So how many can I put you down for?


Yeah this endless pursuit of growth and profits is so fucking bad. They need to do these micro decisions in the long run otherwise they’ll never post revenue growth shareholders expect. 

It’s a toxic cycle which destroys the planet and hurts consumers. It’s a perpetual cycle now.


Air 4 is better because it has a laminated display. This iPad is a bit ridiculous imo


Laminated display, Apple Pencil 2, magnets. The Air 4 is clearly a better model.


Not only that but 

>A new USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter is required for pairing and charging and is included in the box with a new version of Apple Pencil (1st generation).”

Shocking decision from apple


Funny you say that, that's exactly why they've upped the price by over $100 while leaving out key features that would actually justify such a huge price hike! 

 Well, that and filling out a glaring hole in their price ladder, but that's why the 9th Gen is still on the store...gotta leave folks a nice low floor to get in on.


From the pictures, it doesn’t look like base model IPad is compatible with 2nd gen Apple Pencil. I could be wrong as I haven’t read the whole thing but every picture showing the regular iPad only has gen 1 pencil.


Even for last year’s 9th gen. Went from €379 to €439! First time ever they increased the price of a previous gen product?


What the hell, that’s what the iPad Air costed last week.


They sure aren’t gonna sell very many considering where in the market this product is aimed.


so they can keep selling the 9th gen at the same price without cutting it, and people will think it’s a good deal

this is what lacking competition gets us. there’s almost nothing to compete (as in, actually make apple sweat) in the tablet space. apple can just keep hiking the price and say it’s inflation


#HOME BUTTON FOREVER MAN


150 phone has 128 gb and i consider it the bare minimum of storage, how can a device in 2022 launch with 64gb?! I get they are pushing for cloud services but it is getting ridiculous


[deleted]


The US price doesn’t include taxes. All prices in the US are **before** tax.


Did the same. This was a disappointing launch.


An adapter. Ridiculous.


You use the adapter each time. If you’re buying a pencil it’ll come with it. If you already have a pencil, you can get the adapter separately for $9.

Yeah, it’s as stupid as it sounds.


They expect you to use the adapter each and every time you need to charge the pencil. It's ridiculous.


I think they didn’t add pencil 2 support to help differentiate it from the iPad Air. If this supported pencil 2 magnetic charging, what’s the difference? A14 v. M1? No one is going to pay an extra $150 just for M1. Laminated screen? Same.


upbeat relieved shaggy impossible resolute ugly fuel cover quaint wine -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/


They increased the air pricing in the UK to £669 to just artificially make the base iPad seem cheaper.


I honestly thought this replaced the air. But no. So what, you’re going from A14 to M2? Ok…. What else is different ?


Seriously there is no competition for ipads. Android tablets are nice but tablet support for Android is just awful and they still don't have great performance either. I used to have a Galaxy tab 8 ultra but I traded it for an iPad pro and it's just so much better. Even though the tab 8 ultra is like $1400.


People need to try the surface PCs. Or maybe the new pixel tablet will be what others are looking for wrt competition.


I'm awfully tempted by the Lenovo Duet 3/5


Yeah I agree. The conversion from US dollars has been fucking us for a long time now.


Apples strategy in Europe is upping prices based on the weakening currencies there.


They must have a huge profit margin on it, right? How can it be inching so close in price to the Pro. I suppose the display+pencil2 is still a huge jump between the two, both in apple’s cost and for the consumer


They really, really need to streamline it.

iPad Mini, iPad, iPad Pro. No Air.

Maybe even just make three sizes of the same iPad (using the current Mini, Regular and 12 inch Pro sizes).

They have a lot of devices that look almost the same but have differentiating features for no reason (the Mini looks like a small regular iPad or Air but has no Smart Connector, the regular iPad looks like the Air but supports no Apple Pencil 2, and so on).

It’s sort of messy.


there will be an ipad every 20 bucks


[deleted]


The iPad Air is still a much better iPad. 

Not only does it have the M1 but it also has a laminated display, P3 color gamut, a better anti-reflective coat, supports the hardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC video decode / encode engine, has a 12MP Ultra Wide front facing camera, simultaneous 2.4Ghz and 5 Ghz WiFi, etc.


The Air in addition to the M1, supports Stage Manager with external monitor support (eventually),  has a fully laminated screen, better color reproduction, Apple Pencil 2 support ,  and supports the Magic Keyboard.


[deleted]


For me it’s the laminated screen. I really can’t enjoy using any pencil on a laminate screen.


that’s what i’m most bugged about


Low key the worst part about this device. It actually makes a huge difference


Shameless. Especially when this thing looks like a bigger iPad mini which *does* have a laminated screen.


Yikes, thanks you just saved me some money. And the Pro 11 is too expensive now in Europe so I guess I won’t buy an iPad at all.


Instant deal breaker for me.


$599 CDN and still a non-laminated display? Embarrassing


They're running out of features to leave out, I think. So much overlap now between products.


I like how the fact that I’m an iPad Mini fundamentalist makes me avoid this whole issue.

Too bad it creates a separate issue: That Apple forgets the Mini exists constantly and I have to wait like 5 years between updates.


Yup, that's exactly what the price increase is meant for and why 9th Gen is staying in the official line-up.  They want that dirt-cheap baseline option, but previously there was basically no reason anyone considering it would actually move up in the ladder.  Now there is.

Tim Cook strikes again.  Fan-fucking-tastic.


Don’t worry apple has an adapter for people using the 1st gen pencil 🙄 

https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQLU3AM/A/usb-c-to-apple-pencil-adapter


I’m still on my 6th gen and have been patiently waiting for this one, but at this price, I’m just going to go with the air or the 256gb 9th gen. 

Honestly expected an increase, but figured $399 at most 🤦🏻‍♂️


> USB-C to Pencil adapter

For fucks sake Apple lol, just let the first-gen pencil die. That is such a buzzkill, aside from the price which is down in the footnotes


The adapter only lists compatibility with the new iPad, so I don't think it works with other USB-C iPads. Which is nuts.


I think the price is a good indication of how ludicrous even Apple knows this is.


For the absurd prices they’re charging now, they could’ve just included the Apple Pencil adapter in the 10th Gen iPad box


I find it ridiculous that it doesn't. First gen pencil is from what 2015? damn apple.


And it’s not even a corded adapter. It’s just a stick of plastic, meaning your pencil will just still out further.

Surely for that extra $100+ they could have made it support the new pencil. I don’t know who this refresh is even for.


I put in my iPad 7 128GB for a trade in and they’ll give me $120 bringing the price down to $330 which is what the iPad 9 went for. I get they added other stuff but would it really kill them to have 128GB standard?


Yeah I’m super disappointed with how apple handles storage. Wish my family didn’t use apple because I’d love to be on android instead. Feels like they want us to sacrifice an arm or leg for anything not fucking 64GB.


They already went up and above in European  Apple stores :)


Walmart has iPad Air 4th Gen for $469 right now. I think $20 is a fair price for the laminated display in exchange for a 5MP drop on the front camera.


Or a refurbished 11 inch pro from 2018 or 2020


>	Apple is still selling the M1 iPad Air so they probably didn’t want this to cannibalise those sales.

I know the comment you replied to mentioned M1 which I totally get them not adding in there.. but the fact they went with the A14 is absolutely ridiculous when you factor in that the iPad Mini from a little more than a year ago has the A15. 

Ignoring size of screen which is obviously different, that means the iPad Mini has the A15 (5-GPU version aka 13 Pro/ProMax version), Apple Pencil 2 support, a laminated screen which is much superior in general (also some other more minor screen difference), and for those it matters for.. flash on the back camera. New iPad gets.. access to the magic folio keyboard I guess? 

All that on the iPad Mini for 80 Canadian dollars makes the new base iPad kind of ridiculous to even consider at all. The value you get per dollar is just.. not there.

That's a Chromebook dawg


\^ This. There are just too many damn iPads. This new one is not interesting at all; it's just a kneecapped Air 4 which costs only $20 less than a refurbished Air 4 or 2018 Pro.


What even is an iPad Air? They’re already thin and light, it’s not like making a featherweight laptop that fits in any bag


Yes please, simplify the line-up and keep the naming similar to MacBooks. Mini is the small product, Air is the everyday product, Pro is the professional product. Put the “base” iPad to rest


Looking forward to iPad SE


Steve Jobs is rolling on his grave


It made sense when the base iPad was at an entry-level price of around $300. Now it feels practically indistinguishable from the Air.


Nope, the air features a laminated display.


The new additional cable appears to be Lightning Female to USB C Female, so you'll plug it into the USB C cord itself.


There'd be the laminated display and M1 chip.  But yeah, it'd kill the already razor-thin advantage the Air has.  

Really the entire iPad line up just needs to be drastically simplified.  The Air's place in it makes no fucking sense at the moment, and yet somehow  the $449 iPad 10 isn't tremendously appealing either.


Get rid of the air. Problem solved.
IPad, iPad mini, iPad Pro. No need for any of the other ones.


The Pencil 2 has an extra touch sensor, mounting magnets, and a wireless charging coil, but also saves a bit of money by losing the lighting port and magnet for the cap. I would be very surprised if there’s more than a $1-2 difference in the BOM.


Another boneheaded decision from Apple


See that’s no problem because this thing isn’t an upgrade over anything that can use the 2nd gen pencil.


Came here just to comment this. It seems the better option no doubt.


They could’ve simplified their product line a bit and had all of their iPads use the same Pencil. I guess someone important at Apple just really likes to physically plug their Pencil into their iPad.


there’s no way this isn’t for product segmentation. There’s no antireflecive coating or laminated display either. What a shitshow


[deleted]


That’s why I mean by “no magnets”—they’re incompatible because of that. I still have lightning devices like AirPods Pro/Max and obviously my iPhone, but I would rather get something that doesn’t need wires at all instead


I knew we were f'd when I saw a headline about "lower than expected" demand for the iPhone 14 Plus. They have no competition, so it'll be easy for them to jack up prices.

Publicly traded companies have to outperform themselves every quarter. When times are tough, we have to pay up. We now have to pay for Youtube Premium just to watch 4k content now.


The price of the 9th gen increased from £319 to £369 in the UK. Insane.


This should just be put in huge bold letters at the top of this sub lol. Every product launch has the same conversation.


Doesn’t change the fact that the price jump from 9th to 10th Generation in Europe was from 379€ to 579€. They’ve increased the prices by 52%. This is insane and even worse than the price increase of the iPhone 14 lineup.


Depends on what state you live in, some don't have sales tax like Oregon.

But right on brand for Apple.


I guess they fixed the ridiculous pencil-sticking-out-of-the-ipad charging solution by just removing that option entirely


They're taking courage to reduce e-waste. Please correct yourself.


I mean, "which Pencil model do I buy with it?" isn't much of a difference-maker, either. These products are pretty muddled right now.


The pricing ladder…


Dang. I’m a refurb store shopper anyway, so this is all just a preview for 3 years down the line for me.


same in italy, they are becoming so expensive, I'm starting to question if apple stuff is really worth it. I think they are losing more money by losing people over the inflation price bump. they could have just swallowed the inflation. but i'm sure they did their math. it just doesn't check with my feeling.


This seems more inflation driven than any thing else. The dollar has grown 23% stronger vs the pound in 2022.


12.9” iPad Pro just jumped from £999 to £1249 too


£669 for a 64GB iPad Air is depressing, 256GB should be base by now.

It’s like storage has stagnated. Do external drives at least work over the USB-C?


They did didn’t they?! It was £569 before right? This is so shady as it’s exactly the same product just more expensive… if anything it should be cheaper!


I’ve had a few Android tablets and while the hardware was fantastic there were almost no tablet optimized apps. Everything I wanted to use was just the phone app.


Surface Pro is fantastic

But it's pretty expensive


Surface go, which compares to the iPads in price, has a pentium. It could've been much better with arm. and it should have had Windows 11 SE or they should make edgeOS


What I hate about the Surface PC’s and the Pixel devices is that they aren’t available in many countries.

These don’t even have resellers in my country.


Surface Pro is great but you’re not gonna hand a grubby 4 year old one of those to watch minions on


Surface PCs need to try having good battery life.


Not only on Europe. At this point Apple, a US company, is milking all countries that are not the US.


It's very silly that they even still call it the "iPad Air" when its not significantly lighter or thinner than the base model anymore.


Imo I think that's the direction they're going, they needed the air so they had something with the new design language while still being able to sell the base one for cheap.

But now the iPad Air is probably gonna go away or both it and the Pro will go up in price.

Also lol at the USB C to Apple pencil adapter. They should have made the apple pencil female in the first place, then you could just use a USB C to lightning cable.


Ah, the Samsung strategy.


Which makes sense now why Apple didn’t add pencil 2 support. If they had, no one would buy the air.

M1 and a laminated display aren’t worth $150.


I agree, my comment was because when said it was overlapping in price when it does not. Of course, I think $150 is worth it for all those features that you mention, but some users might think that those extra $150 are too much for them, or could be used for the Pencil.


This new iPad Adjectiveless was announced with yet another new keyboard/case, though: the Magic Folio.

It's almost exactly the same size as the Magic keyboard, with allegedly the same nice key travel, but adds function keys (which sounds more Pro to me) and drops the cool hinge in favor of the "case flops open flat" design of older keyboards. 

Weird accessory for a weird product model. Differentiation is a mess right now.


actually stage manager will be available on A14, it just won't support an external monitor.


The mini is more like an Air Mini.


[deleted]


The mini used to fit into this ladder and it'd get dismissed because it's the wrong size, and that moved you up to the air.

&#x200B;

I kind of went through this ladder and ended up with a 9th gen with 64GB because, holy smokes, to jump to more storage and the awesome M1 air was gonna more than double the price.  That's what I really wanted, but to save over $400 I can be careful with my storage and pretend the A13 is plenty snappy (it really is, although the 3GB of RAM really sucks, apps are constantly reloading on me).

&#x200B;

Maybe next time I'll have more spending money and just spend for the better one.  But the ladder just kicked me off at the bottom rung this last time.


[deleted]


Just get a refurbished 4th Gen Air. Hell even the 2018 iPad Pro is better than this shit.


They have too much supply, much like currently airpods v2 from 2019


This just reeks of Tim Cooks Apple decisions. It’s hostile to the user experience.


lol. Here you have an iPad for 100 bucks more than the last gen, you can use it with Apple Pencil, but only the old model from 5 years ago, and you will need an extra adaptor for it, which you only ever will need on this special iPad. what, why don't we support the second gen pencil? cause that would've cost us 10 more cents to manufacture


It's included in the box with new Pencil 1s now.


2nd gen is 4years old now too


I figured this would be the death of the first gen pencil since ALL other models support 2nd gen. Leave it to Apple.


What's the point in numbering gens if you're not going to replace the old one?


I don't know either. It seems like Apple tries to recycle as much as possible of what's left in stock.


Especially considering 128gb chips are like $5 for them. 

Literally. 

Probably less honestly. 

It's fucking crazy


Absolutely worth the extra money. Especially after seeing how the pencil doesn’t attach and requires an adaptor to charge.


AFAIK the iPad Mini has always been more expensive than the base model iPad, at least in recent years, (correct me if I’m wrong here though), and thus has always had more features to justify that price tag, with the only caveat being the smaller display size.

In the UK the price difference is much more significant, ~£169 more than this iPad at base configuration, so again, I can see why they chose to opt for the cheapest chip they currently still have on inventory, as to not cannibalise iPad Mini sales. 

Obviously I’m not happy about these price hikes, especially how they’ve apparently even raised the prices of the Mini and Air models to make this seem more appealing. Sucks even more since I was planning to get a mini, but I’ll wait to see what they have in store next year at this point :(


I just checked the Canadian Apple store, the refurbished iPad Air 4 is CAD $10 cheaper than this new iPad, and it is an objectively better iPad + it comes with brand new battery/outer shell + warranty. The pricing for this new iPad makes NO SENSE.


[deleted]


I wanted to buy one but was unsure if I was actually getting the version I wanted. So I didn't.


The Air branding has even outlived its usefulness in MacBooks as well. Most notebooks nowadays are either thin and light or heavier Pro or gaming notebooks. It should just be MacBook and MacBook Pro at this point.


Midrange branding. That’s all.

Standard iPad is for eduction and other simple stuff like what your grandparent wants. Pro is expensive. Air is the middle ground. That’s it.


imo put ProMotion in the the Air and call it a day


I'm saying they should have just relabel the air the iPad.


But if you kill the Air and move the low iPad into its position, you'd also have to lower the price/feature ratio, and that would then make the Pro an awful buy..


The Air needs to exist for their pricing strategy. People who want the Regular will get turned off and think about getting the Air, then they see the wack storage configurations and consider getting the Pro since it’s almost the same price as the upgraded Air


Apple’s whole lineup sucks atm. There’s way too many variations of everything. Steve would be fuming at this point. 
All we’d need:

13” Macbook Air, 14” macbook pro, 16” macbook pro

Ipad, 11” ipad Pro, 13” ipad pro

Colored iMacs are fine, but also a 27 inch iMac, Mac Pro. No studio. 

IPhone lineup is such a mess, I don’t even know how to solve that.

Basically you need just 3 versions of everything. Budget model and two variants for pros.

Product variations are determined by money now. Not vision.


Also have to add in the charging coil on the iPad itself, but yeah, if the whole thing cost more than $10 I'd be shocked. 

Given that they raised the price significantly on this iPad, just makes this decision more incomprehensible. 

Also really wonder what this does to iPad sales. $329 vs $449 is a massive jump in price, and in one of the most price-conscious market segments. The only thing I can assume is that it's deliberate because they don't think they can meet the supply side demands, so they're making it up in margin.


More likely they have too many Apple Pencils manufactured and they are trying to get rid of them.


These devices tend to be the ones used most in enterprise and education.


well said. the market is saturated and the world is in a fucking mess. shareholders will still expect growths from companies. so greed is kind of the natural go-to solution now.


Besides your main point, but 4K being for YouTube Premium only has been reverted.


They rolled back the 4k idea.


To be fair, Apple is making less money if you take inflation and the british pound value drop into account.

The british pound is down about 17% in relation to the US dollar over the last year, so the 16% price increase makes sense. It's still too expensive though.


[removed]


Some of us live in one of the few states without sales tax though, which means the $449 price is the price we pay.

We make up for it in other ways though, like property tax rates being very high.


Those taxes don't go towards a warranty. That is just you getting free stuff that others don't get and that others pay for. Your taxes are for your socal programs.


What 5 years of warranty?


We not only have 1 tax but 3 or 4 different ones! State, county, city, and special improvement taxes if you shop in nicer parts of town.


That’s a dropped ball for sure. Other examples come to your mind?


ahhh, the apple way

Just took a look at the refurbs, you think a Refurbished 11-inch iPad Pro Wi‑Fi 64GB (2018) at £409 would be a good buy? I was holding off on buying a new tablet to see what the new "budget" iPad had to offer and the offering doesn't appeal to me, but the Pros 120hz screen does


thats just the smart thing to do for apple products imo. People get strapped for cash and I can find at a proper price, usually almost new. on ebay and other sites


Things have rapidly changed in the past 3 years or so, it's astonishing how much better it is these days. It's still not perfect but if you haven't used an Android tablet recently you'd be surprised. 

Still, the iPad 9 was a budget titan in it's class, but now it's basically left the category to Samsung, Lenovo, and Xaiomi.


I think Google is trying to push tablets as part of their ecosystem thing with pixel. I've got an iPad air 3rd gen and love it but as someone who uses an android phone I'm not bothered about the whole ecosystem thing so could see me cross shopping android and iPad the next time I come to change my tablet.


The problem with the Surface is it needs the Keyboard for it to be any good. Look up a review of a Surface and everyone is using the keyboard.


Went with the fire tablet for 2yo.


That has been the case for anything with Air in the name for a while now.


It’s a popular marketing name. Companies rarely just throwaway popular marketing


Wait a second, I thought this was only on the A12X and A12Z chips, but not the A14. Is the iPad Air 4 getting stage manager? AFAIK it is not


Same issue with the iPhone Mini. Then they release a Plus version that sells even worse and they “don’t know why”.

They really need to read their user base better.


I’d imagine a large percentage of iPad users especially those who buy the less expensive ones never use the pencil.


almost choked on my coffee when I saw $599 for the ipad 10


In the U.S. the 64GB Air 5 will be $519 at Costco starting on the 26th -- just $70 more than iPad 10.  There will have to be heavy discounting of the iPad for the holidays too because if the $ difference between iPad 10 and Air 5 is just $70 the iPad 10 is going to gather dust.


It makes sense if they want to prioritize selling their inventory of older devices, as the cost of production has likely risen over the last 2 years.


I got the iPad Pro 11” for $800 CAD on the Apple.ca education sale a few weeks ago. 

Good deal compared  to the new $599 iPad.


I'm looking to buy a new iPad for my parents since theirs is so old it can't download iOS updates anymore and some webpages won't even load because it's so outdated. 

I don't own any Apple products, so I'm clueless. They are in their 70s, so they don't game or do anything with their iPads that puts a lot of strain on it. Would the Air 4 be more than enough or would you recommend getting the 5 just to future proof?

I found some open box ones from Ontario (I'm also in Canada) on eBay. The 5 was $680 and the 4 was $560. From what I gather, those are reasonable prices?


Yep. I'm not entirely sure Jobs would approve of having both a "regular" and Pro iPhone for example. Or 4 different iPads. Or 4 different MacBooks. Or 3 different AirPods (not including the Max).

There should be, at most:

\- 3 different iPads (mini, regular, and Pro; get rid of Air branding)

\- 2 different AirPods earbuds (regular and pro; get rid of regular second gen)

\- 2 different MacBooks (regular and Pro; get rid of Air branding, get rid of old design M1 MBA and M2 MBP)


It’s all about branding on the MacBooks. 

Even just reading your post, as someone who is in the market for a MacBook, I would choose an Air over a regular MacBook.


Jobs wouldn’t approve


Deal.


I guess what I want in a tablet is really different from others because I feel the Pro has always been a bad buy.


The people looking at a regular iPad don't have the budget to pay 2x more for a Pro.


Or they get frustrated by the greediness of Apple and their wack configurations and close out of the website entirely.


Looking at the footnotes, they’re also keeping the 9th gen base iPad around for $329 still, so that’s probably also a contributing factor for keeping the OG Pencil around.


Not this one, as 9th gen is still around. However, once/if they phase out the $320 price point, I don’t think we will see schools/corporations stick with iPads.


I was gonna say, that's absolute bullshit, kudos for people for speaking up


Awesome! The people fought back


Plus states (and cities) all have different sales tax rates. While NY state sales tax is 4% the city sales tax is 8.875%.


[deleted]


No, frankly, because Apple is accelerating the rate at which they drop features from the older models as of late.

You might get 4 years out of that before it gets legacy treatment, you might get 2, it's an unfortunate gamble. Definitely one I would hesitate to play.

You'd be better off getting the Air or even the new 10th gen for the sole reason of it being actually supported for the next 5-6 years.


I’d hesitate to answer this without knowing how sales for new models are in the UK. In the US, new Apple products go on sale often & deeply enough that refurb models sometimes don’t end up being the best value. Try checking other retailers online, especially as we get closer to Black Friday.


If you can snag something on Apple's refurb store, you get a full warranty (including the opportunity to get AC+), new battery, basically like new.

Obviously costs more than other options, but you'll save anywhere from 10-30% off the new price. Can be quite a good deal (obviously the long term OS support plays a big role as well), a way to get a higher spec, etc. Phones and iPad's tend to run a gen or two behind (ie iPhone 12 variants are still a rare find).

Little tougher on eBay/Swappa/etc, people need to look at those listings with a critical eye for sure.

At least the M2 MacBook Air is, indeed, lighter and thinner.


The name tests well in focus groups. That's basically it.


The laptops are actually smaller


I supposed everything after A12 was good to go. Was I wrong. Is the A14 weaker than A12X?


When I saw the press release for the 10 I was thinking “yep I’m gonna sell my 2020 iPad and get this” and then I saw the price and I was like “oh.” 
I just wish they could have kept the 320$ price 
At 600$ it just doesn’t make any sense to get this iPad. Maybe next gen it’ll be more sensible


It’s $519 now on Amazon


How healthy are your parents?


I’d say just get them the 9th gen. If they’re in their 70s, they’ll feel much more comfortable with the home button design anyway. My mom is also around that age and she’s the same way. I’ve been thinking about getting her one. Hers is I think 2nd gen. Ancient. So old that she stopped using it.


AirPods first gen

AirPods second gen with wireless charging

AirPods 3rd gen

AirPods Pro

AirPods Pro with magnetic charging case

AirPods Pro second gen

Kinda ridiculous given all of those are still for sale at some stores and it’s hard to distinguish which is which


>Yep. I'm not entirely sure Jobs would approve of having both a "regular" and Pro iPhone for example. Or 4 different iPads. Or 4 different MacBooks. Or 3 different AirPods (not including the Max).

&#x200B;

Oh really? He had an iBook and 3 Powerbook models. A 12", 15" and 17" and the 12" Powerbook had less features than the 15" and 17". The line was confusing and he had many models. You must've also forgotten about the 20" 23" and 30" Cinema Displays. There was no real reason to have both a 20" and a 23", but he was flooding the line confusing the consumer. There were multiple iPod models. The Mini, Nano, Shuffle and Clickwheel model sold on the website at the same time.

Some of you guys need to stop worshiping a dead man. He was hardly perfect and Apple is far better today than it was when Jobs was around. He wouldn't even allow bigger screened phones. He was an arrogant prick and it was HIS WAY or he'll tell the consumer to go back to Windows.


Doubt he would approve the Apple Pencil+dongle situation for this new iPad either


120hz and the better screen is really hard to pass up for me.


Doesn't mean they won't be convinced to move at least one rung up the ladder even if they don't go all the way up to the top


With that logic they will always keep the gen 1 around because something will use it because they keep making ones with the 1st gen because the last gen had it...


Does it include the iphone?


Offset by the price of course.


This was my biggest hesitation before moving off my old 10.5” iPad Pro. I thought for sure I’d miss the 120hz, especially since I have it on my phone. 

Now that I’ve been using the iPad Air for about a month, I can say I don’t even notice it. For my usage it doesn’t matter.


Yeah. A lot of the lineup is just choice positioning. Sure if it sells that’s great, but it does a lot of work to force the consumer up that ladder as you say.


If I’m going to be using a device like the iPad for 3-4+ years I’m not going to be thinking about a couple hundred dollars of price difference when the screen sucks.


Curious, did you notice it immediately after switching? I am coming from a 120hz iPad and every 60hz iPad I try at the store feels unbelievably choppy and laggy. Interested to know if that goes away. I never recall feeling this way before 120hz iPads came out.


This looks like a winner. Beautiful design for a non-flagship product.


This is gonna sell like crazy. Especially with the A14.


Alright, so the advantage of the Pros over the air are:

Pro-motion 120hz display

Better GPU (8 vs 4)

Face ID

Extra cameras and sensor

Thinner bezel

128GB storage starting price (vs 64 for air)

Apple education bundle with free airpods (The new air won't have this, since promotion ends this month)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With all these, I'd say Pro is still worth the money


Huh Touch ID in the power button maybe that’s their solution for the FaceID Problem on iPhones


* New colors: green, pink and blue (silver and space gray remains)

* Touch ID integrated in power button

* A14 SoC (16 cores)

* 10.9" Liquid Retina Display (2360x1640)

* True Tone, P3 Wide

* USB C

* Front 7mp HD FaceTime Camera; 12mp camera (same as iPad Pro)

* Starts at $599, Available next month


What the fuck the prices and options compared to the Pro 11"

It's beautiful, but... like 64Gb, for $599, then you jump to $749 for 256Gb... then why not just look at the Pro 11"!!!  I don't get many  Apple decisions... The 64Gb is the only one "cheaper"

Price kills it for me. I'd rather spend the extra and get the Pro.


This is the first time they put the Touch ID sensor on the power button


It's 2020 and Apple is still offering 64GB in the base model. I wouldn't mind if they at least offered a 128GB model for a reasonable price bump. It's a rip off that I have to pay an extra 150 for space that I won't even need.

I'm really thinking of getting this as my first iPad but not sure if 64GB will be enough.


I swear calling it the “Air” is so stupid at this point. It should be the flagship “iPad” and if anything g the baseline models should be the “SE” line. There’s nothing about the name Air that makes sense for it. It’s just a Pro-lite.


The price is gonna be a big deal here. If this is still $499 then goddamn, but I'm expecting $599


There’s a high likelihood that those iPad Air colors will also be the colors of the regular iPhone 12 this year.


$599 oof


There has to be a new iPad Pro VERY soon. This seems to perform just as well as the current Pro and is almost priced to match the 11”. 

What differences does the Pro have? Face ID, 120hz, and LIDAR? 

I guess that’s worth $150??? 

Honestly a lack of Face ID is a bummer I love it on my 2018 Pro. 

My fear is the higher Air 4 price will bring up the base 11” Pro price.

The store listing is up $599 for 64GB and $749 for the 256GB (that’s right, not even a 128GB offering).  Their storage pricing is getting so fucking ridiculous

Edit: the 11” iPad Pro is $799 for 128GB, why would you want an Air unless you truly can manage on 64GB?


Comparing the 256GB version of the iPad Pro vs iPad Air, the iPad Pro is $150 more with:
- 120hz ProMotion
- 100 nits brighter display (600 vs 500)
- 4 vs 2 speakers
- FaceID vs TouchID
- 8 vs 4 cores GPU
- Ultra wide angel lens + LIDAR
- Slightly thinner bezels 
- Likely more RAM (2-3GB more)
- 5 “Studio Quality” microphones vs 2

With this, the iPad Pro still seems pretty worth.

EDIT: Forgotten about the RAM and microphones


Keep those tools from the last gen iPad Pro and reuse them to keep margins down. It's becoming pretty common for Apple to take this strategy.


Soo... scrolling thru all these comments, I am now conflicted between the new iPad Air and the iPad Pro. But I'm glad I decided to wait for this announcement.


$599 for 64GB

The next tier? 256GB...

Yup, they cut out the sweet spot for storage to make you pay for more than you need


[deleted]


Ok i am kinda interested on an ipad air, but the minimum storage of 64 gb slightly disappointed me. Should have been 256 gb base model imho specially because of the capabilities. I may be wrong but 64 gb is way too less.


Next year we will get a redesigned iPad Pros with a new updated Magic Keyboard with function keys (?) and a bigger trackpad.. and the current MK will be kept for the iPad Air.


64GB in the cheaper one is such BS. This product starts at $749 not $599.

Also kinda weird they didn’t do a mini update to the Pros with A14. Now the cheaper Air is faster...


Surprised at the price, I thought they’d match the previous model


iPad SemiPro


Now let me use xCloud on it and it might actually be worth


It's finally nice to see Apple adding some color to their iPad line. GREEEEN!


THANK YOU APPLE FOR USB TYPE C.


$599 is more expensive than the 3rd Gen no?


Does anyone know if this has the “tap to wake” feature from iPad Pros?


Thus is tempting. I am using the iPad mainly for note taking in classes and User the old 9.7 iPad pro.


I wonder if it'll be worth getting the Ipad 8th gen or seeing if there's a decent price cut on the Ipad Air 3 now that the Ipad Air 4 has been announced?


I have two questions. Is it worth it to pay $200 more for Air 4 rather than Air 3? And if I want the 3, how do I order it now that it’s no longer on the website


So it seems they’ve got rid of the headphone jack...


I don’t need the processing power of a pro UNLESS it’s the only way to get my HVEC 4k60 videos to my iPad. I currently have a budget 7th gen iPad and when I airdrop or transfer videos they get downscaled because that iPad doesn’t support HVEC.

If my memory serves me correctly, the last iPad Air also didn’t support HVEC 4k60, only 4k30 or something. So I’ll wait to understand if I can transfer my iPhone X videos to this new iPad and lose no information, before buying. 

If not, guess I’ll wait for the new pro


Just bought a 2020 iPad Pro. Fuck me


does it have FaceID?


Can anyone determine if this will be available with free Airpods for the educational pricing?


I was totally expecting the Touch ID under the screen so I was surprised they put it in the power button. I guess my assumption was that Apple being Apple would over-engineer a solution but nope, just put it in the power button.

edit: also, no combination of Touch ID and Face ID, which to me either says that Face ID may be taking a back seat or that Face ID is only for what Apple considers premium devices.


The sky blue is beautiful. Hope it’s an iPhone 12 color.


Apple has no excuse for selling a product for $500 with 64 gb storage in 2020.


Starts at $599


$599 though? If this still has 3GB of RAM wouldn’t a used 2018 11” be cheaper and a lot better buy?


As an Apple employee, this keynote was disappointing. The only thing that really changes and has been changing each year is the processor. They try and “spice” things up with new colors but honestly, the average air user doesn’t need this.


The green one looks amazing. I'm so tempted to sell my 2 months old Pro for this lmao.


Did the new Air end up getting quad speakers, or just dual speakers still, but now in landscape?


I bought an Air just over a month ago and was thinking of exchanging it since I noticed it has a dead pixel. Could I exchange it for this with the 1-year warranty and pay the difference?


Kinda ballsy for Apple to stick the newer A14 inside the cheaper iPad...


I'm already half out the door with Windows. I just fucking hate microsoft at this point.

Another awesome Apple product. Windows has had writing input for a while now but the integration is fucking trash. As a windows user, it's not fun watching Microsoft Windows rott and decay while they constantly fail to build a future. Meanwhile Apple is succeeding at that in exciting new ways.

Yah I'll be joining you Apple folks soon enough. I can't wait to see their new desktop Macs.


Besides getting the larger version, is there any reason one would want to buy the iPad Pro over the Air now?


[deleted]


Any thoughts on this vs the macbook air?


Huh they capped the storage at 256 GB. Would have loved 512 GB option. But I suppose it’s a non issue since they support external hard drives.


$779 Canadian for the base model, 64GB, Wi-Fi only version


I just wish they release iPad Pro that can run Logic Pro X and also allow to connect audio interface using USB-C interface via CoreAudio to capture recording. That would be _really_ pro.


Think ill still go ahead and order a iPad Pro. 12z still does everything and pro motion+12.9” is kill


What people seem to be missing:

Air gives you 64gb for $599 vs 128gb on Pro ($799)


So do I buy this or an iPad Pro 2018 used? Honestly I think A14 will perform about the same as A12X and obviously Pro from 2018 has pro-motion which is a huge plus over the Air. 

My only concern is updates. For how much longer will Apple give updates and support the iPad Pro 2018? 

It's already three years old, so I'm a little upset if that means two years less updates than the A14 iPad Air. Anyone can help me out with how long Apple usually supports iPads? I barely use Apple products, so I have no clue how long they support devices for.


Man I hope the iPhone 12’s have Touch ID in the power button as well


Still debating if its worth upgrading my 10.5 Pro to this


Bruh, the Air comes with a 20W power adapter while the Pros come with an 18W one?


If I have a second-gen iPad Pro and go for the new Air, do you think I will notice the lack of 120hz and ProMotion? I'm curious if I need to go ahead and spend the $200 for the Pro.


64Gb 😂


Does promotion matter for watching video? That’s the primary thing I’ll be doing with this. I imagine scrolling webpages would be smoother with promotion but... I guess I’ll have to put up with it


there’s a blue one omg omg omg


That thing is nice. I have a pro but am sorely tempted by the blue. Must resist.


Why the heck are they keeping the amount of RAM a secret. This makes me think that they're keeping it 3 GB but wanted to avoid any initial bad press.


Woof. I just got the iPad Pro 11" two weeks ago. I realize there are differences but, for my use case, I could probably have saved some money and gotten away with this iPad Air.


i just checked apple's website. seems like they dropped the 599 price tag from their base 64gb air 4 to 549 dollars.


I am still rocking a iPad air 2 and see no reason to upgrade until this baby dies


Still rocking the OG Retina display iPad. Might be time to upgrade


To be fair, while I love my 2018 iPad Pro, most of the magic is the design.

You hold a fucking screen and do stuff effortlessly with it (with some limitations). 

Putting the Air in this chassis is just great. The  Pro is a device on which I can’t really work on (dev) but it just feels so damn fucking futuristic to use that I can’t even give a crap. It sounds stupid and it is, but putting the Air in that form factor is just brilliant.

The all-screen Pro is the most fun shit I’ve used in a decade. I’m glad that they are putting it out for less.


Really curious to see if Apple has done anything to address the weakness of the aluminum unibody of the Pros with such a similar design here. Was disappointed that they didn’t with the 2020 Pro.


A $599 iPad with a $299 keyboard and $129 pencil? Oooffff...

Besides the accessory prices, this sounds like a good iPad addition.


The iPad Pro lite.


This looks like the iPhone 11 of the iPad pro lineup. Affordable and same specs.


I would like to:

-Do some Netflix/general browsing

-Have a device that can handle some light coding as a hobby for building apps/websites 

-Be able to use the device to write reports/novel ideas sketch out possible plans etc

-Do some very light gaming: specifically: MTG Arena (might be a while before the app is ready), Football Manager type stuff 

-Have a super portable device that can stream/read books etc when on holiday 

-Decent battery life 

-Be future proof for at least 5 years

-Sync up with my XR, my wife’s XR and Apple Watch to seamlessly switch to the device and pick up with whatever I was browsing on my phone or whatever. 

Is the iPad air with keyboard the right approach to do all of this? 

Am I better off with a MacBook? Should I forgo Apple this time around and get a 2-in-1 windows laptop?

I have a chrome book at the minute which I’ve had for 3 years which doesn’t do the above well except streaming, writing and battery life. Also the screen quality is average at best. 

I feel like the tech is close to be able to handle the above as an all in one but maybe the iPad isn’t quite there yet. Or maybe I’m wrong?! 

Budget is there I guess - but I might get a ps5 when it comes out, which will restrict what I can do overall. Feels way too extravagant to be dropping £1.2k+ on a ps5 + device for the above.


If only I could use game pass on it


This iPad looks insane - Apple has really outdone themselves with this product.
I bought the iPad Pro earlier this year, but damn I can't live without faceID and that sweet 120Hz screen on my iPad.


So it goes down to the A14 vs A12x and  A12z.

10.5 ipad pro that came out 2017 is still freaking fast today. I can't even tell the difference visually in performance and speed between that 2017 chip and 2020 iphone 11's chip. 

Ipad chips are tuned differently and have their own use cases due to the bigger form factor of the Ipad.  In terms of performance between 2020 IPP and 2020 ipad air w/ A14, A14 chip may be faster but you will hardly notice the difference.  In the context of choosing the latest pro vs the air, I would put more weight to price over performance. You wanna save a little extra cash get the Air. Apple Chips especially the chips are freaking beast and will last at least 4 years. Benchmark scores are meant to give the nerds OCD /s.

  
Not gonna talk about ProMotion, the feature speaks for itself and most users don't want to go back after using. Ipad Pro is worth it for promotion alone in my opinion.


Man, is this thing better than my 2020 pro?


i really don’t understand the point of the ipad pro now


Finally! It’ll take me a while, but I can’t wait to upgrade from my 5th Gen iPad to this new Air!


Honest question - are people really able to lay their modern iPads flat on their backs to write/draw without using a case?

Doesn't the camera hump create an unstable uneven surface for stuff like writing/drawing?


Starts at $599


Looking forward to buy this and the AirPods Pro with the back to school offer


I wonder what the screen refresh rate is.


Need opinions. Have a desktop PC where i do my gaming and primary browsing. No laptop. Looking for something for couch browse, videos, and drawing. Should I snag this or just commit to the pro for higher refresh?


Still only 64GB base storage. 

$879 with 256GB and cellular 

https://i.imgur.com/d8f3u3U.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/i1DgZoC.jpg


So you can get this + apple pencil 2 for cheaper than a ipad pro ....


It’s $549 on the education store and anyone can order it at that price online.


Im buying one as soon as I can, those things look extremely powerful


Wonder how much ram. Probably 4gb. Still a nice jump up from the 3gb.


Do you think education discounts will apply to the iPad Air?

I picked up the 2020 12.9 inch iPad Pro with the education discounts and thought it was good. Thinking about returning it and getting the air though. I have 6 days left to return


[iPad website updated, looks like 2 speakers only on today’s Air. ](https://i.imgur.com/fZHOPMk.jpg) But it looks like it can be stereo in landscape mode.


When does this go on sale? Or pre-sale?


Isn’t it weird that they didn’t show the student discount? They kept saying it’s great for students and now we don’t get a discount?


I've got a 2018 11" pro, and I'm still gonna lean on that some more. New Air has great specs, but I still got 120hz, and the proc bump won't upset what I'm doing. Something tells me 120hz will be a Pro feature only.


The new air doesnt have 120 hz screen ezwin ipad pro


Tbh I haven't been so excited as I was when they announced the USB-C in a long long time


Does the Apple Pencil attach to the side like the Pro’s do?


So are we basically getting last year's pro with this? All the specs seem up to snuff


This or a used 3rd Gen 12.9 inch Pro for the same price?


So students waiting for the new air will just have to wait to have both an iPad and the AirPods. I gotta say I’m pretty angry with apple right now, considering you can’t even get the old air now


Where's the best place to sell an ipad pro? Bought a 12.9 earlier this year and just don't use it as much. This iPad Air would be a much better fit.


I’ve had my Air 3 for just over a month, what would be the best move for me if I wanted to buy the new one? It’s engraved and I still have the unopened AirPods that came with it.


Is it not available to preorder? I am on the apple website trying to preorder and I've entered what color I want, the GBs, Wifi, no engraving, and the trade-in option but the Continue button is greyed out and I can't click it. Is there something I'm missing?


It has no gap between the tip of the pencil and the stroke made on the screen?


[deleted]


My question is are they going to update the pro to the A14 this year? I still think I’d buy the pro but man do I really like that light blue color.


does anyone know if the new ipad air will be part of the back to college promo?


I hope the iPad Mini gets this treatment eventually. It's the last Apple product I give a damn about.


Do you think that Apple would add this new touch-ID sensor to devices that have FaceID? Let users have two forms of secure unlocks


Looks amazing but all i ever wanted was for iPad OS to support multiple user accounts. Its 2020 come one already.


Makes me a bit envious that I bought the last air about 7 months ago. No reason to upgrade but this looks so nice. My only wish is that they’d use (or include) more “mature” looking colors, something a bit darker. 

For example, I’d love to have an iPad in “Midnight Green”, while this new green looks nice it’s just not my preference.


I’m curious how the a14 goes up against the a12z


I’m more interested in the wallpapers tbh


The price doesn't add up honestly. Looks like a pro, but it's not. Should be a great product but kind of misleading. I always liked the air, great change of the design just seems bit pre planned to boost sales.


This iPad Air is still a 60Hz screen though. The Pro is still a better option IMO.


I'm not paying $880 CAD after tax for 64Gb


I love the design of the iPad Pro. I got an 11” recently. Probably the best mobile device I’ve ever used.


The next iPad Pro should have both Face ID and Touch ID. Face ID for you when you are holding the device facing you or using a keyboard. Touch ID for when you have the device flat on a table for writing or drawing. 

It’s so annoying to have to lift the iPad up and tilt it towards yourself from the table to get it to unlock. Two authentication methods could solve this problem.


As an uni student on a tight budget, I am thinking between the 2017 iPad Pro and new iPad 8th gen. I’m planning to use an iPad as a supplementary device to my  laptop. Thank you for your help!


if this came in 512gb or 1tb i would definitely get it


Does it have the u1 chip?


Damn that green though


But where’s the pro-motions of 120? 

I really like they started to use the new TouchID, but they never explain in depth of the touchID. Does it have the same security layers?


Finally gonna upgrade my old iPad.


For $600 I’ll get a refurb Pro. Kinda not digging the widening gulf between low and high with the iPad line. I thought the Air and mini were supposed to me midrange.


Those 5 colors fit amazingly well with the rumors about the colors of the new iPhones 12 Pros : silver, space grey, rose gold, green and blue! (Blue is the new color)


64gb storage as a start is criminal these days.


If only Apple allowed cloud gaming on iPad


Apple = marketing


If someone can explain me the difference between 11" ipad pro and the new iPad air, then I would consider it. 
This is market cannibalization 101


I’d love to get one when I’ve saved up, but the £100 price hike vs the last gen plus the low base storage could put me off


Really curious if this device has Tap To Wake. That, together with the 120 hz screen and Face ID, are things that draw my attention to the Pro.


Let me guess.. Will the blue one be the best-seller? It's fantastic!


This event messed up the whole lineup imo. Whos gonna want the Pro now? Why a three watch lineup? Considering prices and features, some products just lost their meaning. Customers are now more confused, i can bet on it. Choosing the right watch or ipad is very difficult, i know because i work at a certain fruit store.


Do we know if it’s got 4GB of RAM?


i may trade/sell my new ipad for this


Love the new colours. Hate the limited storage options. Really 256gb is the max?


I just bought an iPad Air 2019 3 weeks ago. I feel fucking stupid.


Any thoughts on this vs. the Pro in terms of my main use for it being note taking?


Seriously Apple how long are you going to milk the system with 64GB storage on 4K displays and cameras!? What gives not offering this in 128GB? 128GB should be the minimum at the extreme least. 1TB SSD are under $100... Absolutely not worth it if 64GB and 256GB are all you can offer! Not to mention a 64GB SSD is only $20 and your charging $599 for this iPad!!! What the hell is that garbage?


Legit question, what would be the reason to buy the pro over this? Assuming I don’t care about an iPad camera


Ignoring price, it's all fun and games until people mistake iPad Pro for iPad Air.


But you have to pay almost a flagship product price lol


Looks good but $600 is rough. With taxes and everything else I’m looking at a $700 iPad Air lol


It really is. It was all I was hoping for from this event, and they didn’t disappoint. Confirmed new chip and the new colors. Oh and they finally got the thinner bezels. I’m so excited to get my hands on these


I find it weird that it doesn't have faceID only Touch ID


Really wish they did an 8-9 in ipad air for $499 and dropped the mini name


You're telling me that the 2020 Air has a better processor than the 2020 PRO?!


I don’t think so honestly. Not at $600


Better speakers too (4 vs 2). Although the new iPad Air 2020 has 4 speaker grills, Apple's website and keynotes says its "Stereo" instead of "4 speaker audio". I guess 2 of the speaker grills are for cosmetic purposes?

Comparing both the Pros and Air at 256GB, the price difference is $150. With the above features you mentioned, it seems the Pro is still worth the money.

EDIT: The pros have 100 nits brighter display too. 600 vs 500 nits.

Let's hope

With the prevalence of masks, I'd really want Touch ID back in some form.


This would make for a full screen/notchless iPhone


Does this mean it has no Face ID at all?


I think the issue with doing this on phones is that many cases cover the power button. I think this is less common on tablets. It's not exactly an original idea, many Android phones have had this for years, but I'm not sure how it ended up playing out with cases on those.


Faceid problem?


>	Huh Touch ID in the power button

My left thumb is not thrilled about this.


It seems like it would make case design trickier


Never had a single problem with Face ID. It’s working flawlessly.


[deleted]


-	TRUE STEREO SPEAKERS!


Good lord is this thing better than a 2020 iPad Pro?


does it have 120hz screen?


Don’t forget the laminated screen


The screen is only a .1 inch different from the pros lol


Starts at 64gb


That’s exactly the gist of it. Why not upgrade from iPad to air, when it’s only a few hundred extra for the better stuff and more memory... And why even stop there, when you can get the Pro just for two hundred buckaroos more?


That’s the point. Welcome to up selling.


In Europe with the student's discount it's 835€, plus free Airpods (180€) 
It's the same price as getting the Air 4 + the Airpods. I don't get why the Air doesn't have the student discount.


Only in the US it’s $200 difference. In Australia it’s a $430 difference between the 2020 iPad Pro and the iPad Air 4.


50% of people are saying "why would anyone buy the iPad Pro when this exists - how could anyone justify spending $200 more for so few features" and the other half are saying "why is the price so high, I might as well just get the Pro". Seemingly contradictory sentiments which are roughly equally popular online.


Technically the MacBooks have had this


Have an S10e. Think that as a concept it works really well.


Like Sony phones. I really wish it caught on more. A finger print sensor on the side of the phone was so convenient.


Instead of paying for the 256 gb model, you are better off upgrading to the newest 11 inch pro model at that point. Everything is better on it, and the storage is 128, double this new air. Only significant difference might be the processor on the new iPad Air, but even that is not much larger.


Haha, I remember when Apple was the last to move away from offering 16GB base models on their phones. It'll take a while, but they'll eventually get there... hopefully.


There's a lot of gaslit people in this thread.

"64GB is enough for most people". Sure, but a percentage of those people, who are coming into the Apple ecosystem for the first time, it won't be enough. 

Their experience will be filled with "out of space" frustration, and for what? $20 saved in manufacturing costs on a 60% margin phone? [1]

It's one of the few things about the Apple sales thinking I hate. I was stung by it when I purchased my first iPhone, and I'm sure people every day are stung by it.

1. https://au.pcmag.com/news/50406/teardown-reveals-iphone-x-parts-cost-370


I think it really comes down to use case. I bought the 256gb iPhone 11 pro max and I've used about 25gb of it.  I store everything on Google drive/Google photos and I stream from Spotify.  I could see wanting to store offline movies/shows for trips though.

But I'm with ya, I really wish they would have included 128gb in the base model.  That said, I'll still be buying it.


64GB is more than enough for the average person. Between iCloud photos, Apple Music, iCloud for everything else (documents, app data, etc), local storage is essentially just a temporary cache.


totally agree. 3 fricking levels for the IPAD ? why. Apple used to be so simple.


[deleted]


"Air" is a popular branding. AirPods. MacBook Air. iPad Air.


I partially agree.  It's definitely a marketing gimmick and very confusing.  However, when you look at the specs.  It is actually both lighter (by 32 grams) and thinner (1.4mm) than the base model.  It also weighs 183 grams less than the 12.9" iPad Pro.  That doesn't take away from the fact that it would make more sense to have iPad Pro, iPad and iPad SE similar to the iPhone line.  Even more confusing is the MacBook line.  What a damn naming mess all of this is.


Starting at $599


[deleted]


Honestly i've been on fence about an iPad for a year. if it's 499 i'll be so happy.


Bingo


They're competing with laptops. With the specs it has I honestly think that's a sensible price.

Better screen(120hz), better camera(+lidar), better speakers, better authentication method(faceId) and more gpu cores.  
Pro is still better than air. They really don't need make new pro. But might update processor in the end of a year.


Does the air start at 128 GB?


This iPad Air also didn't include 5G. I'd expect the next Pro will have 5G support.


TSMC is *rumored* to be starting A14X production in Q4. I guess they could announce new Pro's together with a lightweight ARM MBA towards the end of the year the earliest or early next year.

I'm waiting to see. It's time to upgrade my Air 2 but I want FaceId and Pro-motion. So either next-gen Pro or if they raise prices a lot, then a current gen refurb.


Then youre only $50 from the ipad pro 11"...


They really want you to buy that base model pro.


That really sucks. I was tempted if the $599 model was at least 128GB.


Because they want you to buy the pro.  Offer ridiculously low 64 gb capacity and only offer a 256 model.  If you’re considering buying the 256 air then that point you’re realizing you mind as well but a pro for that price.


“getting” lmao. It has always been customer hostile. Nothing new here. It costs nothing to offer 128gb as standard but then no one would buy the 256.


I swear Apple was also insistent that the microphones on the Pro are very high quality. I am guessing the Air won't have them as it wasn't mentioned in the presentation. And that definitely matters for calls.


The iPad Pro will have double the RAM of the Air.


People sleep on that LIDAR, and the AR capabilities are gonna be huge in the coming years, possibly months


Seems to make sense, honestly. The early adopters/power users get the latest performance and features. Everyone else gets them next year at a lower price. Apple gets to save money by reusing features/hardware across two generations of devices. Seems like a win-win.


I’m in the same boat. I don’t love the 64gb storage on the base $600 air, and $750 is pretty close to $800 for the 120hz pro..


Me too. Last year, I bought a refurbished 10.5” pro, and got a used Smart Keyboard, and the pencil. My goal was try it out and see if I could truly use it as a laptop replacement.

I really like it, but my god, I hate charging that Apple Pencil with it sticking out the iPad. I found myself lusting after the simple magnetic charging of the 2nd gen.

So now I want to upgrade, and not sure whether to get the new Air or Pro. I need at least 128 gb, and 256 is preferred, as I keep music and a few movies or shows on it.

Now I’m stuck wondering which one to get, and it really comes down to storage options and price.


Dude, define basic tasks, because internet browsing and watching movies wouldn’t even take up 32gb. I’m not saying that 128 wouldn’t be better but “basic” tasks don’t need much storage.


What was the old starting price? Also 64gb?


LOL


This comment should be more up!


Yes, the old one was $500


I think it will. Most Apple products that had their home button removed, end up getting that feature


Wouldn't be all that useful, considering Touch ID is on the power button.


If they go for the same price I don’t know of any reason one should get the 2020 iPad over the 2019 Air.


The A14 will definitely be able to handle 4K60 in HEVC.


u got 120hz screen and better speakers.


Has 120hz tho.


Same. I got the 12.9" last week. The 120Hz display and large screen size are too nice to give up, even for a less expensive device. The new Air does look great, though. I'll probably pick one up for my fiancee for Christmas.


I mean, that is slightly on you for not waiting to see what they announce at the event. 

Still though, my condolences.


And for that you get 120 Hz Promotion, quad speakers (new Air has stereo), Face ID, a wide-lens camera, LIDAR and most likely better GPU performance.


Face ID > Touch ID for iPad in my opinion.


It’s a better device.


Same dude and it arrived today but I gotta use it for school anyways and similar  price


I got mine in June. Figured that whatever they were coming out with wasn’t going to match it seeing as it wasn’t going to be a Pro. Oh well. I’m not too torn up, it’s not like I don’t love mine lol.


I would still stick with the pro, pro motion is my favorite feature of the pro series. Probably won't see the A14X till next year.


Ask them if you can trade in.


Touch ID only. On the power button


Wondering this too, can’t see it on the education store though


[deleted]


From the pictures it shows 2 speakers on both sides


Just stereo.


-	LIDAR
-	ProMotion (?)
-	4-way stereo (?)
-	FaceID
-	Front-facing camera (?)
-	RAM (?)


ProMotion... and maybe Lidar(?)


Wait for the 2018 11" to show up on Apple's Refurb store. 

1) keep ProMotion
2) keep quad speakers
3) FaceID
4) slightly bigger screen

All for $50 less.


Yeah you’ll notice it. Don’t leave ProMotion


>	Does promotion matter for watching video?

No, but it matters when you’re scrolling, writing, navigating the device.


Are you on the education store? If you aren't, it's $599; if you are, it's $549.


In a way, it might be.

Let’s wait for the price tho.


Better value? Maybe. But it doesn’t have pro motion and Face ID. Also the gpu will still be faster than the A14.


it's funny, half the comments here are say "I don't understand why anyone would buy this instead of the Pro" and half are saying "I don't understand why anyone would buy a Pro instead of this".


Probably once updated the point will be 5G, ProMotion, and FaceID. And starting at only $200 more I can see it. Someone who’s gonna pay $599 for an air is already not on a tight budget so they might swing $799 for a pro instead.


Well if people want the features that the pro has that the air doesn't? Screen size and pro motion is a big one for many I would guess


I have the 5th gen as well. I’ve been eyeing a Pro for years, but I knew I was holding out for a good reason. That blue looks 👍


Thinking about upgrading my Air 2 for the Air 4


You wont be able to. Promotion ends this month, and the airs come out next month


They would have screamed from the mountain top if it was 120hz.


I'm thinking the same thing. I am also in Canada though so the conversion is already gonna kill me.


12.9 Pro


Definitely graphics and screen estate


A14 > A12Z single-core

A12Z > A14 multi-core


That’s why they do the colors. This isn’t the first time they’ve tried to brand the cheaper/mass market product with fun colors and the pro product with simple grey/white/gold.


I don't mind that if I am owning the Air. Sucks for students who bought the new Pro just for classes


But this feels like basically a pro compared to last year's


FFS, you people will try to find a negative in everything.


Yeah. And if you get keyboard thing too, you might as well actually get a laptop at that price.


> I find it weird that it doesn't have faceID only Touch ID

In the age of of Covid?? I wish my iPhone 11 had this on the power switch... I don't like de-masking just to use ApplePay to pay for parking..

**Edit:** Another thought - perhaps this is the where lower-cost iPads will go in the future. Air debuts the new sensor, and then at the next cycle the low-end iPad gets the sensor too? Everything trickles down..


Probably not. I think the 2020 Pros have more GPU cores on the A12Z.


I’d wait for benchmarks. The a14 has half the high performance cores as the a12Z and 25% less gpu cores. It’s on a newer lithography so that helps but I’m not sure it can help that much


[deleted]


[deleted]


very interesting to see benchmarks on those


What's the difference between a single speaker serving 2 grills vs. 1 smaller speaker per grill if they're serving the same side (L or R)?  
  
It sounds to me like they don't want to use the same language for both but in the end it's the same thing


When would you guess that is


Yup, I have a first gen iPad Pro 9.7 and it still works fantastic, only reason I want a new one is to upgrade to a 12.9 so I'm waiting one more generation.  Honestly, if they had an announced a 12.9 air I might have gotten one, all I use my iPad Pro for is painting in Photoshop and watching Netflix.


Hope it's in addition and not replacement.  FaceID is far more convenient IMO - although I wish they could code the algorithm to account for masks during COVID times.  Right now, it is annoying.


Combo of touchID and FaceID?


Where would the selfie camera go?


No way they get rid of Face ID, it just ain't happening


The Air doesn't have FaceID because they want to maintain some reason for people to buy the Pro. There's no chance whatsoever that they'd remove FaceID from the iPhone. Insanity.


Can you imagine how sweet the iPhone 12 pro max will look without a notch?!


Yeah, maybe they'll invest in a power button camera too


Yeah, air only has one front facing cam


Is that the only finger you have?


Why would you not map it to your pointer fingers?


That's more realistic. I was seriously in awe of a 16 core CPU of this nature for a sec there. That's your biggest difference than the pros. The pros have more GPU cores, right?


[Rejoice! Not 4 stereo speakers, but 2 stereo ones. I’ll take it. ](https://i.imgur.com/I0SUzL5.jpg)


One of the most annoying parts of the 3rd Gen Air. It has dual speakers, but they’re both on the bottom.


The Pro has a 120 hz display, an ultra wide camera, LIDAR, better speakers, smaller bezels.

The gap between the Air and Pro narrowed a lot, but the Pro still has a lot of premium features.


Only + that pros have is Pro-motion, extra cameras, thinner bezel, face id, and better GPU performance (4 vs 8 core gpu)


Promotion? No


No


[deleted]


Oh shit. They've got me. I refuse to be caught!!


I'd rather just get the 2018 iPad Pro


Because it’s not available yet. But you can see the student discount prices for the Air when you go to the Pro’s education store site and change the URL to -air (instead of -pro) at the end. Starts at 585,80€ instead of 632,60€ in Germany (7,4% discount) with 64GB vs. 814,32€ (856,80€) for the 128GB 11” Pro.


I use that a dozen times a day. Login in to a webpage <touch>. Check account <touch> stocks <touch> you get the idea. I also do 90% of my redditing on an old air.


I have an S10e as well and really have enjoyed the fingerprint sensor in the sleep/wake button. It works well on a small device like a phone because my thumb can naturally go to that button very easily just holding it like I use it all the time. Not sure if I'd get tired of it being on top of a large device like the iPad. I still enjoy the FaceID for that on the iPad Pro.


*cries in left-handedness*


Yea, I'm either leaning towards the 64GB Air or 128GB Pro. I don't see the appeal of the 128GB Air since the Pro is only 50 dollars more and better in pretty much every category I care about.

I think might just get the base Air model. I only really need it for media consumption and browsing so 64GB might be enough for me. And I'd rather save the 200 dollars and get the Xbox Series S during the holidays.


The A14 is likely not going to be as fast as the a12z. A14 will be in the next iphones, A14X will likely be in the next ipad pro. This will actually be faster


Right... by the time that 128GB is seen to be lower than the standard expected


And there’s 4 new iPhones coming next week


they should have called it iPad SE.


they are going with the naming they use for macbooks.

Macbook (12 inch)  
Macbook Air  
Macbook Pro

iPad  
iPad Air  
iPad Pro


For 64GB...


64GB is insulting at that price


Did it say only 64 gb and 256 gb? I’m going to be extremely dissapointed if so. It should at least have an option of 128 gb minimum.


Jesus charging $150 more for 192GB of storage...that should be considered price gauging


If they're competing with laptops, then they need to give more than 64 gigs of storage for $599.


Add in the $300 keyboard and that’s a big no chief


Not when you equip it with 64GB, that's outright shameful.


When it has a laptop OS I'll believe that


Maybe but it always sucks when they increase the price with a new generation


[removed]


Honestly I don't see any reason to buy the Pro over the Air right now unless you need the bigger screen. Most people don't buy a tablet for the camera or speakers, there are very few that need the gpu speed and authentication methods are just a trifle. 

Suspect a huge update is coming to the pros or there is no way apple would do this. Maybe they'll run mac apps after the ARM transition?


More cpu cores too.


No its 64GB which is ridiculous for that price


Nope, 64gb


same. they had me until I saw that. I will not pay that price for 64gb. ill wait for the next iPad Pro update.


Hell, I'd have been good with 128GB at $649!


Yes if 128 Pro works for your need, but no if you’re actually looking for 256GB storage (me).


Yea the iPad Pro has 5 “studio quality microphones”, whereas the iPad Air has two microphones.


Oh yea I totally forgotten about RAM! Apple don’t usually announce device’s RAM so we’ll have to see user reviews of the iPad Air to determine it’s RAM. But I think the Air will likely have less RAM than Pro.


Yup, no complaints here. It's a smart move.


[deleted]


[deleted]


hey its me your fiancée


Oh definitely,  thankfully I'm still within the return window. Waiting to see if they update the Pro for some reason


Oh, right. So Air does not get 120hz? That's a hard pass for me then. I'm an illustrator so that won't fly with me lmao.


599


In Germany the offer goes until 29th October

edit: according to this https://www.apple.com/de/promo/pdf/DE_DE_BTS_FY20_TandCs.pdf

Most folks throw it in a case and the color will never be seen again. It’s a nice device.


Remember the iMacs ? :-) the Jeff goldblum ad about beige


These colors look dope, I hope they do the same with the new iPhones.


I’m not a student, but I bought an iPad Pro 2020 in the spring and have no regrets at all. There is a new product literally every year that beats the old one.


[deleted]


Why does it suck for them? They are still enjoying their iPad Pros.


How was the restaurant? The food was terrible. And such small portions!


What's a computer?


And a built in co processor whatever the hell that means


It is half the gpu cores. 8 vs 4.


You can kind of extrapolate total system performance based on transistor count:

A12Z: 10 billion transistors (7nm)

A14: 11.8 billion transistors (5nm)

But we don't know the clockspeeds yet, or instruction width, or instructions per clock.

But very closely matched. I would bet on the A14 being better at everyday tasks.


How often does multi core come up in daily use? This question isn't rhetorical by the way I genuinely don't know.


> Machine learning will be no contest with the Air being much faster at that.

Under which context would this be fully realized in day-to-day usage?


Agreed. As I commented above

the differentiation between the 2020 air and the 2018 iPad Pro 11inch. IPP has promotion display, Face ID and A12X. Air doesn’t have promotion, has Touch ID instead and A14 bionic.


I suspect the iPad Air actually has 2 speakers, and the grills are for aesthetic purposes for symmetrical look. Like how the MacBook Pro speakers aren’t actually at the speaker grills but are beside the trackpads.

I also recall that when the initial iPad Pro was launched, Apple mentioned that the 4 speakers actually calibrates the sound based on how the user carries the iPad. According to an online source, when an iPad is landscape, the 2 speakers nearer to the top will output mid and high range sounds whereas the bottom two speakers will output bass. When the iPad orientation is flipped, the speaker output switches too. If the iPad Air only has 2 speakers, I don’t think this feature is possible.


I think on the iPhones it's an addition due to covid but it won't be around for long. They're probably working on eventually getting the tech under the screen. I don't think they'd remove it for a year and have everyone depriprotize supporting face ID and then bring it back under the screen.

Plus they'd have had to do a lot of design changes (like literally swapping the screen out because they're not just gonna leave the notch there if they were gonna take Face ID out, a lot less than adding a scanner in the power button.

Edit: I was referring to underscreen face ID, not underscreen fingerprint scanners.


I’ve always said that adding FaceID while removing TouchID was a mistake. They should have kept TouchID around for additional/alternative security, and just moved it to the lock button as the new air has.


On my iPhone 8 I could *never* get the touch ID to work right.  I reprogramed my fingerprint like 20 times.  Even when it did work it was slow as hell.  FaceID with my X has been nearly flawless.  Face masks obviously are an issue but it's not too much of a hassle to just use my code when I need to.


I don't find FaceID more convenient at all. When I had TouchID on my older phone, I could have the phone unlocked by the time it's out of my pocket. Now I have to purposely turn the screen on and make sure the phone is the perfect distance from my face and look at it to unlock. It takes much longer for FaceID to unlock a phone than TouchID.

I agree that Face ID is more secure, but Touch ID is way more convenient and still secure.


iTouchFaceID


Why not? Best of both worlds.


Under the screen 🤯


An Apple drone that constantly hovers in front of your face


In my mind, you do dual cameras from behind through the screen and run screen negating interpolation algorithms to defuzz and combine the inputs.


I want both!


At least to me, this is a plus for the Air.   It would also be a plus for the iPhone, if they let it have both.  I already disable FaceID because it is useless with masks or if you have it lying down on a bed trying to read (the angle sucks).


That combined with a more square design ala iPhone 5/5s would be perfect


They won’t remove Face ID lol


Power button flashlight though...


The 2020 Pros have an A12Z.

A12Z has an 8-core CPU (4+4 config) and 8 GPU cores.

A14 has a 6-core CPU (2+4) and 4 GPU cores.

Face ID on iPad honestly isn’t that great when you’re using the iPad landscape. So not a big loss.


Is laminated good or bad


Exactly. Please go buy the most expensive iPad. The economy needs your money 🙏


Quick! Hide under your new iPad Pro!


Hey, I hold my phone left handed all the time. I have a large enough hand to wrap round the back and still activate it.


[deleted]


I got the ipad pro recently in 128 gb. in my opinion, that’s all need since most of the stuff is stored in the cloud


100% what I plan on doing too. I’m going to sell my Xbox one x for $250 with some games on eBay and get the new series x for $250 instead after. Win-win.


Oof...


There it is. 

It sounded too good to be true from all the positive comments, but there's the catch. It's not a 600 dollar iPad, it's a 750 dollar device marketed as starting at the useless price point of 600 dollars.


I think for an iPad it would be fine, right? I fill up the iPhone capacity with photos/videos, but you wouldn't be doing too much of that on an iPad surely. Unless you're using it for video editing or illustrations i suppose.

I'm curious as to what iPad users are using to fill up their drive


Step 1: Provide an insultingly low amount of storage with first-gen products to tempt people into purchasing the more expensive model.

Step 2: Add few new features, but double the lowest storage option for the second-gen to what it should have been to begin with to get more people onboard.

Step 3: Finally add some new features and/or change the design a little but move storage choice back to Step 1. Rinse and repeat.

The Apple way.


They’re pushing people towards iCloud. It’s annoying for people like me who don’t keep photos in iCloud, yes, but for most people casually using their iPad, 64 gigs will be enough


You're gonna be disappointed then...64GB base and then 256GB only rip


Can’t wait for Magic Keyboard SE surprise on October event then! That’ll be $199 with no space bar, delete and enter keys, it’s my prediction


The best authentication method is both of them on the same device.


Uhhh as a 2018 pro owner the 120hertz refresh rate screen makes a huge difference, once you go to high refresh rate you never wanna go back. 60hertz screens are ruined for me. Now other than that I agree the pro is a tad overpriced.


Nowadays speakers and camera are actually pretty important for all the people using their iPad for video conferencing and online classes.


Overall, the Air does feel like a better deal, but I’m just pointing out that I was specifically excited about the speakers on my Pro. No matter the orientation, the sound just emanates from the whole device, and it’s made me pack up my Bluetooth speakers.


100% in agreement and I’d 100% buy an iPad that runs Mac apps at launch


And if you want to do any actual gaming on an iPad, 64gb isn't going to cut. Dragalia Lost is like 10gb now. I have a 64gb Pro and I have to pick and choose what games I want installed, rather than just downloading multiple games.


If there is any update it won’t be until march 2021


[deleted]


Not with iPads. Most people use a Smart Cover or the Smart Keyboard rather than a full case for an iPad, whereas an iPhone is generally in a case.


It’s worth it just for the larger ProMotion display for me, personally.


A new product 4 or 5 months later that's a good deal cheaper is a bit different though. Pro obviously still has advantages but $200 for 120hz, a LIDAR camera and possibly worse performance...yikes.


yeah but sometimes you just get shit on, like iPad 3 vs 4


Ha. I know that’s a joke. But there are things MacOS is far more suitable for than iPadOS.


A co processor handels "non essential" tasks to offload the main CPU in order to work not only faster but also more efficient.  Nowadays a coprocessor is built in nearly every high end device. Usually they sit in the SoC an handle signal processing, encryption, sensor data etc.


[deleted]


As well as a camera flash correct? (I don’t use my iPad camera but just to confirm.)

I have the 2018 11” Pro so I’m interested in knowing what that performance difference is. Still wouldn’t swap because of the 60hz screen but I am curious.

EDIT: And thinner bezels I think. Not sure what the aspect ratio difference is. Too lazy to do math. I wonder if it’s a 3rd different ratio from the 11” and 12.9” Pros.


TouchID works maybe 1 in 4 times for me, FaceID ALWAYS works. I never want to see touchID again


Touch ID only had an ~80-90% success rate for me. Face unlock is damn near 100% unless I'm wearing a mask. For that reason alone it's better.


But the screen turns on when you lift the phone up, and it only has to point somewhat towards your face to register. Then you’ll just have to swipe up to unlock.

You’re making it sound much slower than it is.


Smack your face on your screen


Oh shit


Honestly, I could probably see Apple making an iPad Pro like bezel design on an iPhone SE and putting Touch ID in the power button. Technically it would be “worse” than the iPhone 13 or whatever iPhone is after this one, but it’ll sure look a hell of a lot better.


Give them 3-5 years


Punch hole right in the center of the screen.  
  
This is our most iconic selfie camera ever, we think you will love it


First of all, you throwin too many big words at me, and because I don't understand them, I'm gonna take them as disrespect.


Same! I miss Touch ID so much, would be so helpful, especially this year with corona and having to wear masks. I love Face ID too though so both is good!


I have an 11” 2018 Pro and at first glance thought this 2020 Air might even be an upgrade. I really don’t think it is, though. I really like the 120hz display. And the processor has never been an issue for me. 

Like you though, if I was picking between the two right now I’d probably get the Air (although the base 11” Pro seems better than paying the extra for a 256gb Air if you need more than 64gb storage).


The air has nice specs but after using a 12.9 iPad it would be hard for me to go back to anything smaller.


I don't know about that. Stepping up to Pro is still gonna be another $200, A12Z vs. the A14, and is a bit heavier than Air. A big plus for Air is just how light they manage to make it.

I make it a point to buy lightweight electronics. When I visit family, their electronics feel like anchors


Face ID works perfect when the iPad is in the keyboard case. I love face ID on my iPad Pro and I use it pretty much 95% of the time in landscape even in tablet mode. I hope that the next iPad Pro orients the Face ID camera system in a landscape mode.


Really, you must not have used iPad pro's face ID. It's actually really useful.


BS. FaceID works great which ever way you are holding it. Go get yours serviced.


Good. It means no “air gap”.

Stimulus money gotta be spent wisely on a new iPad, amirite?


As much as I agree that it really should be 128gb for $600, I personally don't think that the 64gb model is "useless".

I have an iPad Pro with 256gb, but it's a secondary device for me. I'm mostly taking notes, doing sketches, reading, and watching Netflix on it. I'm not really taking photos or downloading movies. So in reality, I'm only using 21.5gb. 

I can definitely see a market for using it as a secondary device, especially since it's an Air and not a Pro device, that would be perfectly fine with 64gb, so I wouldn't consider it useless.


No, this is clearly false. There's a very large number of people who simply don't need a lot of storage. Personally, I only use 22GB on my device. And various family members get by just fine even with a 16GB device. It's ignorant to think 64GB is "useless" for everyone.


iPad I usually need more storage. I download more temporary Netflix videos for offline use, I have more games on the device, and the other reasons you mentioned would add storage need as well


[deleted]


Don’t forget to add the step of skipping the sweet spot of storage most people will actually want. Instead jumping from 64gb to 256gb and missing out a 128gb option.


I really wanted a 128GB option for the new iPad Air...


You can use Google Photos for unlimited original quality photo storage if you use Apple's HEIC format instead of JPG.


Apple being Apple. The new iPad still comes with an insultingly low 32gb of storage.


This. 120hz is definitely a luxury I’m absolutely willing to pay for. It makes the OS feel like water.


Agreed. Whenever I borrow my wife’s Air 3, the screen feels awful. There really is a noticeable and jarring difference after you get used to the 120 hz


That’s the differentiation between the 2020 air and the 2018 iPad Pro 11inch. IPP has promotion. Air doesn’t.

Edit: and obviously the A14 bionic processor compared to A12X


I wouldn’t be surprised if tablets replace laptops as a daily driver for most people (people who don’t need specific hardware for work) within the next few years. I love it and frankly going back to a traditional laptop at this point would be annoying.


Wonder if air will have less ram.


Face ID too!


And FaceID and brighter display and quad-speakers and 128GB storage standard....


For the $200, promotion,64gb vs 128gb, more ram,better/more speakers and more storage option. I don’t know how LIDAR is used though.
They are still selling both iPad Pro and iPad Air. There is market for both


If we're being technical, we don't really have traditional CPU's ever seen we integrated the north and south bridges into the package instead of the mobo. And graphics in some chips.


You would be correct. IPP 2018 has flash.

Most curious about the multi core score with A12X having the extra core unlocked.

The comparison page has been updated and the 2018 IPP is 2388 by 1668 resolution at 264ppi and the air is 2360 by 1640 resolution at 264ppi. This probably accounts for the .1 inch difference in screen size.

And it shows the IPP having quad speakers compared to air still having 2 speakers.

Tidbit from the comparison page the 2018 IPP is rated at 600 nit brightness compared to 500nit on the air. Found that interesting.


Camera flash, ram, base storage, and something is up with the speaker situation but we may have to wait for press to ask questions or just reviews I guess.

You got me thinking about the aspect ratios though since I’m low key obsessed with this haha.
All Touch ID iPads and all 12.9” iPad Pro are 4:3 aspect ratio so 1.333. 
The 11” is a nonstandard 1.432 so like between 4:3 and 3:2. 
The new iPad Air is 1.439 so virtually identical?? 

Wonder if apps designed for the exact resolution of the 11” without support for size classes (or adjustable layouts) will have thin black lines on each side in landscape lol OR if the iPad will just zoom to fit and crop the pixels off. They could have increased the short side by eight pixels I think and it’d be the same aspect ratio…lmao


But the phone would be unlocked with touch id even before it reaches my face 🤷‍♂️


[deleted]


Aim high Willis!


Watch your mouth and help me with the sale.


🤣


I got the SE for a few reasons but I love Touch ID. If it were on the power button, that would be a game changer


I’d still prefer the 2018 pro honestly. Four speakers, 120Hz, face ID, etc


I would not call the 13g difference between 471g (Pro 2020) and 458g (Air 2020) big. It’s less than 5%.


[deleted]


Also the base model Pro comes with 128gb storage.


Oh nice! Appreciate the reply


Absolutely. There’s a reason it’s called stimulus money.


I still feel like 64gb is a lot of storage (maybe on the low side for the price) My Air 2 has 64gb and I can barely fill half of it with all of my documents and apps. Even when I still had my full iTunes library on it (around 35gb) I never felt like it was a problem. 


My dad has a 16gb model and I'm glad that that isn't the baseline anymore... he can't even update without removing everything because iPadOS 14 is 3.5gb!


Well, as another student, I had to do some massive offloading to get my space back. At ~40/64 GB used and I'm running a very tight ship -- no apps that aren't used daily allowed. It's hard out here. I just want to know if this new Air has dual speakers before I commit.


Some of my photos are quite “private” tho


At this point 32gb chips must be more expensive than 64gb chips


> promotion

Man it took me a second to realize that was ProMotion. I saw another comment asking if the iPad Air has "promotion" and thought they were asking if it was discounted already.


That and the Pro has FaceID. After I switched to the 12.9” pro, though, I’m going to have a hard time going back to anything smaller.


That was my scenario. I have a PC in my basement, but if I’m using another device anywhere in my home, it’s my iPad.


[deleted]


I don't see this happening anytime soon. For people on the go, trying to use a tablet on an unstable surface or your lap just doesn't work when you need to use the keyboard. Also, the screen size is limited. Anything less than a 13.5 inch screen is killer on the eyes if you have it setup as a traditional laptop further away from your eyes.


The main blocker right now is dev work. I still need a laptop to write and test code effectively. I know there are solutions but they aren’t great.

With a true IDE, the iPad Pro could honestly replace my MBP for all but the most memory-demanding tasks


One you add the clip on keyboard and the mouse it can absolutely replace a laptop. 

Oh, wait.


*wears a mask 90% of my day*

Yay...


and 64Gb


[deleted]


ProMotion is 120hz display. 

FaceID vs TouchID is a matter of preference. Hell some may have preferred touch ID but went with the pro because of the better performance/design. 

Speakers/storage/display are valid points.


and bigLITTLE! We live in such an awesome time for computer architecture


I'ma come back and clap both y'all


Probably much more RAM as well. Which is much more important to how long it'll last IMO


Different strokes and all that then.


>took me a second to realize that was ProMotion.

Just wait until you hear about procreate.


Haha I’m surprised Apple doesn’t have autocorrect enabled for ProMotion yet like their other products.


Ah yes thank you. Literally just a retooled IPP 2018. If you can snag a refurbed IPP 2018 you’d probably have a better viewing experience display wise. I’ll be curious to see the multi core score between the two processors being A22X has that extra core unlocked.


Do you read books on it by chance?


And more cams plus LIDAR on the 2020s as if I've ever used them more than trying some scanning apps for 20 minutes once...


The iPad Pro has mouse and keyboard support and the Magic Keyboard has a really great trackpad. 

The Windows Surface line offers an even more traditional laptop experience in a tablet—it’s really a touchscreen PC in an iPad-sized tablet body.


This so much!
If you choose the 256 GB Air it’s 50 Euro more for the Pro with 128 GB. That’s a no brainier.
Don’t get these prices/specs 🙄


Name checks out!


Yes and iPad Air doesn’t have a 120Hz display.

FaceID / TouchID are indeed preference-based.


I did exactly that and got a 2018 pro from the refurb store earlier this year. Got it for about £500 iirc.


That’s what I got 5 days ago from refurb store. It’s confusing if I should give back iPad Pro 2018 and get iPad Air 2020. I got the iPad Pro 2018 for $679 256gb version. Seems like the processor is the only thing different with the latest iPad and rest all are same or better On iPad Pro 2018. Not sure how much of a difference WiFi 6 will make to every day life if you have a regular internet and modem. Any suggestions?


Not regularly, no. I read comics every now and again. I have to imagine holding it vertically, one-handed, for long amounts of time wouldn’t be pleasant.


i read them on mine, along with comics and other "printed" media. it's really nice, since you can fit a lot onto one page (or i can zoom in a bit and read from a distance without glasses while booking it on the treadmill).

it's obviously terrible for holding like a normal book but fits in the lap nicely.


[deleted]


That’s exactly why they’re doing this. “Only 50 more” for you is 50 more for them.


[deleted]


the magic keyboards aren't really made for lap use, which is one reason i don't personally own one. i keep a normal cover on my ipads and just use a wireless kb and a magic trackpad instead. works really well.


It wouldn’t be hard to simplify the iPad and pencil lineup, but it just keeps getting more complicated. Makes you wonder if the people planning the lineups behind the scene are also working in a state of chaos.

Edit- clarified last sentence.


Choosing an iPad is easy! Just follow this simple flowchart

https://preview.redd.it/tn9dn98qayub1.jpeg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c72a6a1cf9281650a30fa2ee936606869059a22


Slowly turning into "design by committee" again. Only this time Steve Jobs ain't coming back


Tim Cook’s reign has had a lot more of these than it should.


I like how when Steve Jobs became CEO of Apple back in the late 90’s, one of the first things he did was simplify the product lineup.

Obviously as a company selling products, you need options to accommodate people. But having too many options confuses the customer and makes them not want to bother getting your products if it’s too confusing for them.

Unfortunately Apple has made everything INCREDIBLY confusing now. Which Apple Pencil do I get? Which AirPods? A USB-C one now for the Pro? What about the 3rd Gen? What? It’s just for the Pro model?

Which iPad out of the 20 variants do I want? Why is there a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and one without? How come I have to buy the wheels separately for my expensive as hell Mac Pro? Shouldn’t they just come with them?

Apple makes enough money. I like a good chunk of their products. They can do with a massive simplification pass.


It’ll only be confusing until they stop selling the iPad 9 and Pencil 1. Then it’ll be all magnetic Pencils with wireless charging and pressure sensitivity as differentiators for the high end model.


It's 2023 and we get a pencil without wireless charging. Nice move!


A lot of Apple’s product lines are becoming too confusing with weird branding. It could be a lot simpler. The Plus/Pro/Pro Max reeks of early 2010s Android energy. The iPad line is especially egregious.

Just streamline it to represent a smaller, budget model; a standard model, and a Pro model with a “Max” variant.

iPhone SE, iPhone, iPhone Pro + Max

iPad SE (Mini), iPad, iPad Pro + Max (13 inch)

iMac

MacBook (Air), MacBook Pro + Max (16 inch)

Mac, Mac, (Mac Studio), Mac Pro


This should have been a new high end pencil release.

I’d like:

Longer battery life

‘Find my“ support

A Taptic Engine that might give tactile feedback when you are going over lines or paper texture.

Finger Tap interface to be replaced with a Force Touch Squeeze for example:a light squeeze would bring up a function ring on the display to rapidly pick options like undo, swap color, etc a harder squeeze would bring up a level 2 function ring with more rarely needed function. The idea being that you could draw and move fluidly between all the tools with just the pencil so you don’t break creative flow state and just have this pure fluid creative output

And finally, I would like to have barrel rotation register (such as the Wacom 6d art pen) to really get a true replication of natural tools (that would round out the tilt, azimuth, and pressure sensitivity)

What do you think would make a perfect Apple Pencil?

EDIT: I'd also say having a factory nano textured screen for paper like resistance would be nice (Like a factory installed version of Paperlike)

EDIT 2: You can see an example of a radial menu over here (sure apple could implement more fluidly on IOS and sure Procreate would do some amazing productivity things with it) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSlc1lotvQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTSlc1lotvQ)


Legit. Apple product lines are a bit... weird sometimes. The whole lightning to USB switchover (if they even continue down that path, you never know) is going to get even more messy.


I know a lot of users have said “this will be less confusing once Apple launches their newer products and phases out old ones” but two things,

1. We don’t know if they’ll phase them all out. Apple did keep the original Watch 3 for a long time. For all we know the 1st gen Pencil could be kept around for the massive market of pre-existing iPads
2. They could have delayed the product launch so it makes more sense…

I honestly don’t understand why it’s not called the Apple Pencil SE.


The iPad team needs to be revaluated.


No pressure, no buy.


iPad, cheap, one size.
iPad Air, midrange. Two sizes (regular size and mini size bur still only called iPad Air)
iPad Pro, pro, two sizes.


It’s nearly as confusing as navigating the verges website


No pressure sensitivity huh? That makes it almost obsolete for artists.


We’re in a transition. Once Apple gets rid of lightning on all devices and peripherals, the lineup will be much simpler.


I’ve been an Apple user and fan since 1996. Every day it is more difficult to defend or justify their moves. Sadly, Apple is not run by designers and engineers anymore. It is run by profits. I know it is a company and every company runs on profits. But now it is the main motive. In 2000, the user experience was first. Now it is second or third.


It used to be really simple; if your iPad had a lightning port you bought the first gen pencil; if your iPad had a USB-C port you bought the 2nd gen pencil. Now you could potentially buy the wrong pencil.


the fact that the "iPad confusion zone" is a thing and I understood exactly what they meant by it despite having never heard that phrase before is telling that Apple doesn't have a plan for iPad


I was recently in the market for an iPad to use for basic things. (Browser, YouTube, Email) I looked at $1000 iPads, $700 iPads and $500 iPads… they all looked the same to me really. I ended up buying a iPad 9th gen for $220 new. I understand its limitations… but it does exactly what I need and it’s running the latest iPadOS wicked fast and the battery lasts forever! I’m not storing anything on it so 64GB is just fine… I really don’t see the need for 5 current iPad offerings from Apple.


An Apple pencil without pressure sensitivity is useless.


When in doubt just buy a galaxy tab. Bought it and Samsung gave me the pencil, keyboard cover, charger and wireless buds just so I have less choices to make, it was all included. Made my life pretty simple, it all just work, the bundle simplified shopping and saved me money.


~~If it has a round home button Touch ID, you need the first pencil. If it doesn’t, you need to second one. If it’s not the iPad 9, you can use the third one.~~

Fuckit. It’s a hot mess.


I don’t see how it’s confusing. It’s 3 different options and all of the differences have been summarised in a small table. This couldn’t be any easier.


it's really not that confusing once they phase out the nonusb-c iPads.


[deleted]


I honestly just want variations in the nibs at this point, there are so many 3rd party ones but I find that they break easily. I’d like to see a first party one, maybe that wouldn’t be so flimsy


Apple’s naming conventions have bit them in the butt, but to me, the current line up should be

* Base iPad -> iPad SE
* iPad mini remains the same
* iPad Air -> iPad
* iPad Pro remains the same

* Apple Pencil (2nd gen) -> Apple Pencil
* Apple Pencil (1st gen) -> Apple Pencil (Lightning)
* Apple Pencil (USB C) -> Apple Pencil SE

“SE” can take on whatever the iPhone SE means, which to me, is “simple edition”, it’s not feature pack, it gets the job done, it’s the entry level.

No names are the mass market, general consumers, balancing the features and the cost. Modern design language but maybe cutting back on power/some tech. (Staring at 60Hz and no Promotion)

“Pro” - Apple’s high end and everyone knows this

And then an optional name for unique segments, mini for obvious sized-oriented consumers, Lightning for the first gen pencil to focus on the port. 

I think SE, Regular, and Pro can really help identify the product segment and be applicable in MacBooks, iPhone, and iPad. Problem comes when things get segmented due to a physical change (iPhone Pro’s cameras)


[deleted]


Lol, Verge really trying to gin up outrage.  If 2 pencils and 4 iPads is confusing to you, you have far more problems probably buy apples (the fruit) than you do tech.


Just buy a clonic cheap 15 usd pencil, since it has no pressure sensitivity


I think it’s confusing if you want to internalize the whole line up and be able to explain it to someone off the top of your head. But for the buyer, looking at the chart makes it quite easy to make a decision based on budget and features. It’s not a “clean” line up, but it works


Are we STILL lollipop charging?? Personally as soon as an iPad came out with that magnetic charging solution that’s when I snapped one up. Still on the 2018 iPad Pro and haven’t even thought about upgrading in years.


Whole Apple lineup currently is a mess currently. There are too many models in every product type.

* What's the difference between iPad and iPad Air? Which one is better - MacBook Air is a cheaper one, so is iPad Air should be the cheaper iPad? Right? Right?
* Why there is still MBP 13" with TouchBar?
* Why we have 4 different iPhone models instead of just two like in the pas - big and small one?
* Why the hell Apple TV has two different models?


[deleted]


Orr - Apple Pencil has to somehow confirm to iPad confusion zone


They still charge full price for the Apple Pencil 1, why?


Since sales are tanking, Apple will eventually streamline their products. Way too confusing and the original Apple Pencil is hot garbage! 

New Apple Pencil is $20 cheaper and loses wireless charging?! Awesome. Now you have to plug a cable in, yay, very usable!


Steve was a man of simplicity

Tim only seems to care about the money


Following this intently and saving this post because my iPad Air 3rd Gen (!) will likely bite the dust soon and will need to be replaced. I may just go with the new Air and not purchase a pencil until the dust settles on that - if it ever does.


I am just now learning about this product, and this might be the dumbest product Apple has made in years. I can’t imagine why this exists other than to confuse users. If I explained this hardware to my mom, she would get mad at me and walk away, my dad would probably start yelling.


Apple Pencil should’ve just been named Apple Pencil SE, dropped the 9th generation iPad and 1st generation pencil. Also should’ve gave the new pencil pressure sensitivity. 

Shortens the lineup and removes a lot of confusion. It’ll also make the 10th gen look a lot more reasonable to buy over an air or pro. 

If someone wants the extra goodies like wireless pairing and charging, double tap and engravings, they can look into the M1/M2 iPads and go from there.


Why, Apple, why?


People really love to exaggerate this stuff


Just needs to be one pencil. Idk.


I think once the iPad (lightning model) gets dropped the lineup will look straightforward.

We’d have:

iPad mini

iPad

iPad Air

iPad Pro

The Pencil lineup will be the most confusing.

Because the Apple Pencil (2nd gen) works on all iPads except the new iPad (10th gen).

And the new Apple Pencil (USB C) works on all iPads.

If Apple made the iPad (10th) work with the second gen Pencil it would have finally simplified things. But Apple is strangely insistent on sometimes having the most confusing ass marketing (e.g Apple TV, Apple TV app, and Apple TV+)


I think of all The poor would be artists getting a pencil with no pressure sensitivity and I cry


I am sure there is a method to their madness.


They're bean counters, under Tim Cook who understand that "if you have something for everyone," they'll make more money.  This is also why HP has 100,000 models of printers.


I bet it is actually because of the EU USB-C mandate, plus Belkin shelving their pen meant that Apple needed a cheep/easy option for schools to purchase at half price.

It’s fucking confusing though.


My guess is all of these product lines (meaning the several apparently parallel iPad lines too) are stovepiped as fuck, especially with work from home being more popular so that results in a confusing set of products


They want people choosing the most expensive workflow without directly saying that obviously.

But I get it it’s a for profit company, they aren’t here to make you save money or give you things for free.


lol, yeah kind of.


That's the plot to Primer, bro.


120hz is literally my only requirement.


Thanks! After following this helpful chart I have decided I need to buy them all.


If you can’t figure out the difference with some basic research on apples website, how does one even choose phone carriers, find directions in gps, pay taxes, literally how do people put 0 effort into buying such an expensive item. 


It’s amazing really, like, you’re committing to spend over 700 dollars but don’t know we have different iPad models?


4 models is that complicated for you?


How’d you get a screenshot of the first data model I worked on in my career


So you found my UML diagrams.


This is a stupid take. There is nothing to suggest there is “design by committee” going on — and even if there was, that’s how design has worked at Apple for a long time except the committee is the ID team — and this isn’t the Quadra issue. 

Instead, what we’re seeing is the confusion behind maintaining and continuing to sell older products as part of the broader lineup. This is an operations-enabled (seriously this is super complex) profit margin maneuver. iPad is an entire product line like the Mac is, and multiple products designed to serve multiple markets is important. But most of the confusion stems from selling older models longer than they should be, in pursuit of hitting each price point. 

If Apple stopped selling older models, the confusion disappears almost entirely. iPad with lightning and thus the older Apple Pencil are the only real confusing part here. 

Want a cheap iPad, designed for education? The simple basic iPad and Apple Pencil (3rd gen) is the answer. Non-education customer who wants an iPad? You have an option of two sizes in iPad Air and iPad mini. Need more, or a larger screen? iPad Pro. 

There’s not much confusing about that, beyond the temporary naming of Apple Pencil. The 2nd gen model is clearly better, but it costs more. If it were to be renamed “Pencil Pro”, there a significantly easier to understand decision now. 

It’s a marketing problem, because they are selling old models.


If he was reigning anything, this sort of thing wouldn't happen.

I mean, I've heard of "reigning it in" is "reigning it out" a thing?


Yup! We almost got a family member 3rd gen AirPods over the 2nd gen pro for their birthday because 3 > 2 but thankfully we found out last minute and got them the pros instead


Not to defend Apple, their naming obviously needs improvement, but it’s not as bad as people think.

The thing with tech enthusiasts it’s that they want to see this consistency and logic across lineups because they want to follow up on what Apple is doing. And I hope Apple manages to improve things, because I believe they actually know naming is important, it’s part of a proper marketing process after all.

But, as far as Apple is concerned, you go to the store and find: iPad > iPad mini > iPad Air > iPad Pro. And that’s it, you chose what you need *at that moment*, regardless of what existed or will exist.

The thing kinda falls apart because they tend to sell multiple current generation products alongside multiple previous generation products. But every lineup is a different question that must be asked at the moment of purchase, again, as far as Apple is concerned.

The wheels on the Mac Pro are another question entirely. The client for that product is different from the client of pretty much anything else.


Thank you.  So glad to hear other people say it.

I mean 15in macbook air?  what's air about it?  it's bigger than the freeking pro, but without fans.  I feel like I am taking crazy pills!


I mean the industry has changed massively too. They had to simplify things because they weren’t profitable. That’s clearly not an issue today.


Does the new one have wireless charging? I thought it charged and paired with USB-C and just having the ability to magnetically attach.


Yes, and those are basically only around for continuity for education buyers I would assume (or until they can get the 10th gen down in price and have enough differentiation between 10th gen and air).


No headphone jack because people need to cut the cord.  Also, here is a small device, smaller than many headphones, and it requires a cord!


Bringing the ‘Max’ branding to other lines makes things even more complicated. Max should just be dropped all together and replaced with the screen size, like it already is with the iPad Pro and MBP. 

iPhone SE, iPhone, iPhone Pro (with 2 sizes)


> MacBook Pro + Max (16 inch)

That's not going to be confusing at all given the labelling of the SoCs. Also as stupid as "iphone pro max" is, "macbook pro max" is worse. The Pros are distinguished by their screen sizes, and that is perfect. Bring that to the rest of the range instead.


Max should go away. Plus is better.

Max is confusing in Macs. Max isn't the max speed M series chip, and "Max" is easily confused with "Macs." On the Mac, get rid of Max. Make the chip lineup M1, M1 Plus, M1 Pro, M1 Ultra. The "Pro" moniker would come in when two chips are bonded with the ultrafusion architecture, not when they get an SoC with all cores working.

Max is bad in iPhones. Max implies that it's more than the Pro model of iPhone. Pro and Max have always shared the same SoC. Sometimes the Max gets a better camera, but the difference is usually on a single camera, and never enough to justify a model name. "Plus" makes more sense on iPhone as it describes what's going on.


Also, why hasn’t the iMac gotten even an M2 chip yet? Wtf? It hasn’t been updated in 902 days. Is the iMac team just getting paid to fuck around?


Half the things you mentioned would require a pencil redesign that takes what we have currently, and making it several times larger in order to accommodate a larger battery + Taptic Engine which would incur serious usability issues for some users. This isn’t like a phone where the device being slightly thicker wouldn’t make the phone harder to use.


Just wait until this gets released as Pencil Pro, further complicating the line-up.


> Longer battery life


> ‘Find my“ support


> A Taptic Engine that might give tactile feedback when you are going over lines or paper texture.

> weighs 2 pounds


Maybe they’re planing to phase out the SE naming. Or because they don’t see the name the same way people see it, which is just “cheap”.


>I honestly don’t understand why it’s not called the Apple Pencil SE.

The low-cost Apple Pencil is probably going to be the new "regular" Pencil when the Pencil 2 gets a "Pro" successor for a higher-than-Pencil 2 price.

I think the rumored interchangeable magnetic tips are "real," but for a future "Apple Pencil Pro."


We need more people like you to put some pressure on Apple.


They're really starting to appeal to the lowest common denominator.


It’s clearly not meant for artists, but just those wanting to take notes and have stylus.  It’d work at $40 or $50, but too close in price to the full pencil at this point. 

Which tells me that product is getting a price increase in its next release.


the 2nd gen pencil is the artist option. This is the I take notes, why pay for pressure option


I doubt many artists are using the cheaper iPads this pencil is designed to be used with anyway. I mostly use my 2nd gen Apple Pencil for notes.


At that point, it's just an ordinary stylus.


No pressure sensitivity makes it just an awkward mouse? Or maybe it's meant to be a pointy finger? Will we see fat-finger shaming ads henceforth? Or does Apple know something about a genetic mutation that will make the index fingertips of new born children extra wide and flat?


Not for people who only use it for taking notes. I only use my 2nd gen Apple Pencil to take notes.


Wrong on your second point. The 2nd gen pencil does not work with iPad 10.


Apple simps are hilarious


The majority of consumers purchase the cheapest iPads. This new pencil fits into that demographic


Great times ahead. I can already imagine 1000 posts about "which pencil is best". And a ton of spec warriors comment on that. Most of those will obviously recommend the "pro" version. Spec warriors always love "pro" anything.


Did you compare feature set, device compatibility and pricing..... einkorn!!


3 pencils.


Scully era mentality LOL


The 2nd gen pencil also works on the mini + wirelessly charges from it. For $30 more (apple refurb) you get a lot more value with just going for a second gen


Probably because there is [a devoted non-USB-C market](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-apple-pencil-announced-with-hidden-usb-c-port-and-more-for-79.2407830/page-4) so there's no reason to lower the price: 

>That crowd posting in *every* thread about iPhone 15 going USB-C with comments about lint magnet, wobbly, fragile tongue, etc? Yes, they seem to have just about evaporated since Apple actually rolled out the change but they were so passionate about it even days before the launch. Clearly, this fragile, lint magnet, wobbly is NOT for them. 😉

In all seriousness though, I think one reason is that Apple wants to push buyers (who can't or won't buy the Pencil 2) to the low-cost Pencil. Any nontrivial price drop for the Pencil 1 places it in low-cost Pencil territory, and since the latter lacks pressure sensitivity, it's not always a clear choice between one or the other.


The real reason is they probably have hundreds of thousands in stock and it's Apple.

Should have been deleted a long time ago.


Because this will appeal to pencil users in both categories that might not otherwise buy one due to cost to pick one up. And will also even tho cheaper “upsale” Gen one users that don’t know any better about pressure sensitivity to this over the Gen 1.


Rename the second gen Apple Pencil to Apple Pencil Pro. 

Then the Apple Pencil released yesterday will just be the Apple Pencil


Having the iPad and iPad Air is confusing. Merge those. There should be the iPad, iPad mini and iPad Pro


Wish I could find that thing about Steve jobs “only two models” for each product.


The iPad Air still seems so odd. Why the fuck is it called iPad Air? That moniker made sense for the MacBook Air when it was thinner and lighter than the other MacBooks. And it makes sense now because the MacBook Pro is way heavier. But the iPad Air weighs about the same as the iPad Pro right? Maybe even more!


I don't quite understand why they need three models in addition to the mini. I'd combine the smaller Pro with the Air (tbh I'd combine the Pro with the MacBook, but I know they won't do that)


I'd argue even reduce it more: iPad Mini, iPad, iPad Pro. The Air will become just "iPad".


It should be like the IPhone and considering it sells at the fraction of the IPhone sales it even makes less sense.  This is what it should look like.
 
* IPad SE
* IPad 15
* IPad 15 Mini
* IPad 15 PRO
* IPad 15 PRO 15 Plus


I recently bought the 2nd Gen pencil for my partner not even considering it wouldn’t work with their 10th Gen. 

I saw it worked with older gen iPads so just assumed it would for the 10th.

In hindsight I should have specifically checked, and I normally do. Frustrating… 

Got it engraved too. Now we are stuck with a useless plastic pencil that cost 140 quid..


Man, the marketing for the Apple TV+ TV shows is insane. They literally release the trailer (most of the time, they just release one) one month before the show releases, which doesn't create much hype around the TV Show.


The Pencil is an input device. Imagine selling a mouse that would only be compatible with specific macs. What a failure.


The iPad Mini (6) is higher in the range than the iPad (10):

- $50 more expensive
- more recent SoC (A15 though underclocked v A14) despite being a year older
- USB 3.1 Gen 1 (up to 5G) versus 2.0 (480M)
- P3 color gamut
- laminated display with antireflective coating
- supports gen 2 pencil
- truetone flash

Size aside, the only points on which the Mini is not as good or better is Bluetooth 5.0 versus 5.2, and a lack of smart connector.


No part of what you explained sounds simple. I feel like we only need three iPad models and two pencils. Everything USB C ofc.


Why don't they just drop the iPad entirely? Just have mini, air, and pro?

It's so goddamn unnecessary to keep producing a product that's inferior to your others and charge damn near the same price.

Same with the pens. Quit selling Gen 1, only sell Gen 2 and fix your fucking 3rd Gen. People used to buy apple for quality and design, now it's just for the logo and clout. You haven't made a worthwhile product in nearly a decade.


the ipad 10th gen will be an Air if they gave the pencil 2 support


Wait. What? The second gen Apple Pencil doesn’t work on new iPads? What is that?


Im into tech and all that crap, yet i dont know the difference between all these ipads..


Yeah but they couldn't afford the extra $5 to fit the new iPad with the reverse charging needed for the 2nd gen pencil, so they spent a fortune on R&D to create a daft new pencil that will confuse everybody and which nobody really wanted all to save that $5 per unit. This is what happens under a supply chain man like Tim Cook.


I'm really surprised people aren't talking about this more. I can't think of many styli, and certainly no 'premium' styli that don't have pressure sensitivity. It's such an expected feature for any stylus product. I'm absolutely shocked Apple would put their name on something thats going to have such a poor user experience--really? They're going to enter the realm of the Logitech Crayon and LG Stylo?


It’s not made with artists in mind, it’s for people that just want to take notes.


I think of all the people who want students to buy a much more expensive art-optimized stylus just to take notes and I cry.


Yeah, all 3 of them, lol.


I use it for notes for work and the cheaper, non pressure pen sounds great for my use


That assumes they didn't bother to read the product description before dropping money on it, and then they can return if it's not what they wanted.  Why're you're crying over that is beyond me.


You're right the base model seems entirely designed to move people up to the Air, but in practice there is very little to nudge anybody from an Air to a Pro.


> a for profit company, they aren't here to make you save money 

What do you mean? Clearly you've never met Nvidia. "The more you buy, the more you save!"/s


There’s actually 6 models, 3 of which are the same physical size yet don’t all support the same accessories. There’s two iPad Pros, but the larger one has had a vastly better display for 2 generations now to the point where it feels like the smaller one is being shafted. There’s two iPads (no moniker), with the higher priced one being a worse version of the old iPad Air 4 (but is actually the best iPad if you do a lot of video calls). Then there’s the actual Air, which is a slightly worse iPad Pro 11 with really muddy value proposition due to the limited storage options (64GB and 256GB). And then there’s also the mini.

The only real standouts in the lineup are the 12.9” iPad Pro and the iPad mini. There’s a very clear gap between those and you’ll know which one you want immediately

The confusion mostly comes in with the iPad 10th Gen, iPad Pro 11, and the iPad Air. There’s just too much overlap between them. They all look near identical to each other but span a price range from $449 to $2099 depending on configuration


I understand what you’re saying, but the lightning Apple Pencil is still a better choice for the 10th gen iPad, because it allows for pressure, and the newest Apple Pencil doesn’t.  
And you can’t use the 2nd gen Apple Pencil with the 10th gen iPad because it lacks wireless charging.


that's the wrong reign, also they never said reigning it out, whatever that means


>The thing with tech enthusiasts it’s that they want to see this consistency and logic across lineups because they want to follow up on what Apple is doing.

They often ignore the real-world factors that result in product lineups being often complicated and sometimes confusing. The current iPad lineup covers prices from $330 to $2200 in roughly $100 increments until $1200. 

* If you have a budget of $*X*, then you can go to the store and buy an iPad that costs $*X*, more or less. 
* If you want features *Y* and *Z*, then the three tiers of standard-size iPads mean that you probably won't have to pay "too much" (iPad Pro) to get the features that you desire. 

Cutting or merging models will mean that some customers will get less value for money or Apple hides the complexity somewhere else, for example, the suffix. 

The iPhone is Apple's most consistent product and people here still complain about it.


That’s how it is. It doesn’t have wireless charging.


Don't think it magnetically attaches either


I think they probably like keeping the Max branding on the iPhone for two reasons:

1) another superlative word to market the prestige of the product, like it or not

2) gives them leeway to differentiate the models in ways other than screen and battery (such as with the cameras this year and previously) and hide behind the Max branding to do so without confusion. Not that the max branding isn’t confusing in other ways, but you get my point hopefully lol.

I think it would go a long way toward streamlining if they simply ditched the Pro, Max, Ultra names for their M (and now A) series chips and came up with another name scheme over there. More than once, I have had to tell someone to “check out the M1 Macs- well, not the M1 Max, the M1 Macs in general”.

For the phones I wish they would adopt the model year scheme that Samsung has. Since they launch in September they could handle it like car brands - this year’s phone would be iPhone 24, running iOS 24 on an A24 SoC.


The issue is that Apple gives the Pro Max different hardware. iPhone, iPhone Pro, and iPhone Ultra would be nice and simple. 

The iPad Pro’s are exactly the same aside from the display.


Unless reverse battery charging from iPad itself while in use


The taptic engine hardly needs space, though. 

Moreover, I am pretty sure a new design could have small improvements to the battery without increasing its size.


The surface slim pen 2 has slightly better battery, the ability to be tracked and found, has haptics and weighs less than the Apple Pencil 2.


In fairness, an AirPod has Find My, so the tech can be very small. Apple Pencil works over Bluetooth, so the radio is already there. Find My support on an Apple Pencil doesn't seem wild.

Taptic Engine would be cool, but I agree about the size and power requirement issues.


Yeah instead of pressure you are paying for the logo. Great value!


Or a thin finger.


LOL. You might not be the target audience for the Apple pencil.


Why?


It does, [its listed under compatibility](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUWA3AM/A/apple-pencil-usb-c?fnode=0b01a406b8c29c2dd9fc07d743ab09cdc70d92ca9f42299dddbf05e844f75eed9b61c0b274fc2fd77a59e8cbac0b13580d848db8321cc7b378f4299d01859dcb1aef43891bcae805ff93582e681fe24391f1f6c1aad391d90c02e0a77c65f12f).


“Hey guys, first time posting!! Which size Apple Pencil looks best in my hand?!?! I SIMPLY CANT DECIDE!!”

*posts 12 pictures of Apple pencils in various hand positions*


That’s for the people who need those features


iPad mini
iPad SE (og iPad)
iPad (the Air)
iPad Pro

Then yeah, accessories follow a similar naming convention. The current naming schemes are like a cross between Mac circa 2012 and iPhone naming conventions. They should pick a lane.


This 
It shouldn’t be this hard


That sounds terrible


Problem is, they still need an actual Pencil Pro, something more ergonomic etc.


Don't make it simple!


And add a few bucks


I still don’t understand the difference between the two. I get the mini and pro, obviously. But what are the air and iPad offering different from each other? Is one the cheaper option? It feels so unnecessary


Unless the iPad is priced at 300$ it makes no sense.


Jobs' concept for computers was four, rather than two, basically "two by two": Consumer and Pro, Portable and Non-portable. So iBook and Power Book, iMac and Power Mac was the lineup of four computers.


Yeah but Apple was a very different company when Steve came up with that model (1998). Back then, Apple was selling dozens of models of Mac. (Plus they were licensing Mac OS to third party companies.) He said that but then he was the one oversaw the Mac mini (2005) and then he was the one who pulled the MacBook Air out of the envelope (2008) and created a third line of laptops and a third line of desktops.


[Air is still *slightly* lighter than either size Pro](https://i.imgur.com/WsHxPWo.jpg)


Mini is smaller; Pro is top-quality; Air is good-quality; Base is cheap


The only iPad I don’t see being worth it is the 11 in. Pro, just beef up the Air specs, maybe make the screen OLED, and a new, bigger Pro model. 

The Air is perfect for creators that don’t do all of their work on an iPad. But I’m finding myself needing to upgrade because even if I go for the M iPad Air, ITS CAPPED AT 256GB. I’m making comics and when Procreate Dreams comes out, animations on this thing and it’s CHEWING through storage especially when I actually use this thing for entertainment as well.


Do we hate choices or something? 

Not sure how this makes sense to be quite honest.


It already is like that, mostly, according to this comment:
https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/s/mCKB1WNAeG


Well.... sell the iPad, get an Air or wait for the iPad 11 and hope it will support 2nd gen.


I’ve returned engraved devices before just fine tho? Obviously I don’t feel bad about it because there were serious issues like the device was damaged or whatever, but they never asked me for the reason and just accepted it because I was within the refund window


The Air still has a much better display (P3, laminated, antireflective), a much *much* better SoC (M1 versus A14), and support for the magic keyboard.

Whether that is worth $150...

Also not exactly worth the moniker of Air, at the same dimensions (within 1mm) it's like 15g lighter (3%).


Gen 2 doesn't work on regular baseline iPads; works on new iPad Air, iPad Mini, and iPad Pro.


Second gen works on every model except baseline.

Pencil (USB-C) which will release next month works on all models.

I’m ignoring the lightning iPad and Pencil as they will likely be phased out soon.


I’d imagine the majority of their pencil users aren’t artists, but students using them for note taking. Some of them may even automatically convert the handwriting to text. For them, it really doesn’t make a difference, there is no “poor user experience” to speak of because it’s a feature that doesn’t matter to them.


It's not a premium stylus for Apple standards. More like a Pencil SE since it's cheaper than the rest.


LG Stylo? Isn't that a phone with a stylus? I think you're thinking of something else.


It’s not hard to imagine why. Clearly their research shows that many people don’t use pressure sensitivity so this makes for a good cheap option. I got the Apple Pencil 2 originally for procreate and now I only use it for non pressure sensitive tasks of which there are many.


[deleted]


This is 80 dollars! What students need the features of tilt sensitivity? All a student needs is a 10$ dumb stylus or if feeling a bit fancy and want better latency and precision, something like the $40 zag pro stylus. 

You should still be crying if someone is making students buy this shit.


My dude, I literally have a $20 knock-off chinese stylus that has the exact same spec sheet as this stylus.  Actually more, I didn't have to pair it with a cable(which apparently is a thing on the new stylus???)

If you want to go to a more recognizable brand, Zagg sells a stylus with the same features for somewhere around $30 cheaper.   Even the Logitech Crayon is $10 less.

Make no mistake, you're paying for the logo more than anything else here.


Good news, there are already many cheaper alternatives  than this with the same features in the 20-40$ range.


I use my iPad Pro with a Goojodoq stylus from Amazon and it's amazing. Super cheap and does everything you'd need for note taking. 

I use it at work for notes, smaller things I might fat finger, and specifically use it to play Football Manager a lot, I can't recommend it enough if you're not an artist.

Not sure if I can link it, but it's the top link on amazon if you search that name.


I know how grandparents think when they buy gifts


Most people buying Pro models of most anything don't need the pressure to be upsold, they're buying it because it's the top of the line model and *they can (usually easily) afford it*.


> very little to nudge anybody from an Air to a Pro.

12.9" screen. That's all you need, if you want that screen size.

Makes mine a full 13" MacBook Pro replacement, and with Microsoft finally polishing up the Remote Desktop app for iPadOS I can also get native Magic Keyboard trackpad support for a real mouse cursor over RDP. They've also fixed Retina rendering, so I now get as-good-as-native resolution on my remote session.

In terms of battery life, performance, screen quality/brightness, stylus support, on pretty much all fronts it smacks the shit out of a 13" Surface Laptop 5. Given that the SL5 and XPS 13 are the two closest competitors in the "thin and light high performance 13" laptop" category, it's a pretty compelling buy if your job uses virtualized infrastructure. Load up the RD app in the morning, and I get a wonderful high-resolution, lightweight 4:3 screen Windows laptop for productivity. Close down the app, and I've got iPadOS running smooth for personal stuff, photo editing, and my side gig contracting work.


I didnt count the sizes of the same product. Threw a number that approximately the right one. 

So yeah 4 or 6 ain’t that complicated


Right, which is why it’s still being sold. 

Theres a very clear future where all iPads support both pencils, and the option is do you want pressure sensitivity or not. If you’re just taking notes (education) you probably don’t care. 

Apple’s product lineups always get a little confusing and convoluted when in a state of transition like this. It always shakes out.


and when that ipad is no longer a retail option, the pencil won’t be either.


You really seem to be struggling with context here.


Ah, yes, the pricing ladder. It makes even more sense to see it as this spectrum of features at a given price, and it kinda makes it easier for people to stretch their budget a little bit more, to the benefit of Apple, of course.

And still it’s more logical to see it in a sort of vacuum, at the moment of your purchase.


Wtf why not?? That’s such a stupid feature to gate keep when it’s already gonna be able to connect to the side


Why do you consider the 12.9” iPad Pro the same as the 11” despite having completely different screen technology, yet consider the 15 Pro Max completely “different hardware” worthy of a new name because it has x5 zoom instead of x3? That’s rather hypocritical.

If you’re going to use that logic with the iPad, the 15 Pro Max is ‘exactly the same aside from the camera’.


You can’t simultaneously ask for better battery life while also having the device do more at the same time, especially with a device like a stylus. 

Moreover, while the haptic idea sounds good in theory how would you be able to produce haptics that would feel good to the majority of users while also not impeding their workflows? Most people likely aren’t looking to have their pen/stylus vibrate in their hand while using it


[deleted]


I use the Apple Pencil everyday everyone who uses Apple Pencil isn’t an artist. How dare I think taking notes instead of using a pen and paper isn’t a use case. Who do you assume the target audience for the Apple Pencil is?


someone wanting to take notes is not the target audice for the apple pencil? are you okay in the brain sir?


Because Apple said so.


That’s the new USB-C pencil. The 2nd gen Apple Pencil for $129 does not support the iPad 10.


"Why don't you just scroll down a bit. Your question has already been asked and answered a thousand times."


And when it doesn’t work we can get the “you’re holding it wrong” posts :)


> iPad mini iPad SE (og iPad) iPad (the Air) iPad Pro

This is it. You literally just fixed it.


Then the pencil can be Apple Pencil and Apple Pencil Pro

Or alternatively, Apple Pencil SE, Apple Pencil and Apple Pencil Pro, for if they ever decide to release a third gen Apple Pencil.


Air starts at $600, you can get a new 9th gen iPad at $330. It’s not a small price gap.

Think of it like this:

1. iPhone SE = iPad
2. iPhone 15 = iPad Air 
3. iPhone 15 Pro = iPad Pro 11 inch
4. iPhone 15 Pro Max = iPad Pro 12.9 inch  
5. iPhone 13 mini = iPad mini


The iPad is essentially the iPad SE, and the iPad Air is the "default". It pretty much exists only as a budget option for mass use, like in schools. It's good, but if you want to compare with other tablets, always use the Air as base model.


I remember buying my Power Mac, an upgradeable, extensible desktop machine, for about $1200. That’s about $2k in today’s dollars. While the Power Mac / Mac Pro did creep up in relative price during Jobs’ time, it sure would be nice to move a little bit back toward a sane price point in that segment of the Mac market!


Yes you're right, my mistake, but still I agree with his idea of keeping it simple.

Now it's awful.


Even before the Mac mini, there was the eMac.


Maybe they should focus more on making the names mean something
XR, Air, Pro, Ultra???


The iPad, iPad Air and iPad Pro 11 inch are currently indistinguishable from one another when they're turned off. Something has to give.


Would rather just cut out base-model and make Air the default one.


Base is good for what I need it for! I still wonder why they went with a two, now three year old chip when the tenth gen was released. I mean the obvious reason is cost reduction.


The mini should just be an 8" iPad Air, and drop the whole mini name. That's basically what it is, anyway.


Except that one time 2015 - 2018 when MacBook Air was the cheap one and MacBook was the much more expensive one.


> Do we hate choices or something?

I mean, it's the apple sub after all...


It isn't though.  Mini is a mid line device but you don't know that by the name.  Its the same hardware as the air but smaller. There are two IPads one with lighting and one without and both have different specs and different price points.   Worst is you're expected to remember generations and those generations aren't consistent.  IPad Pro 11 is on generation 4 and IPad Pro 12.9 is on generation 5.  They are both the same specs besides the display type and size.


most people cannot notice those "extra" features


Oh weird. Thanks for the reply. Why the inconsistency?


I’m not so sure. My understanding is that schools still depend on them so they need the lightning version and probably don’t have money to buy extra dongles… If I were to make a guess, I’d say they probably have large investments in charging-stations, pens, aso. but I don’t actually know.


Then why does it have tilt. Take that off and knock another $10 off the price. I think the priorities in this pencil are skewed, imo


It's $80 and has an Apple logo on it


If it was 20 ok. You can get a Wacom stylus for 80$


This isn’t any different at this point from the $20 ones that look identical (and charge via USB-C) on Aliexpress. The pressure sensitivity is what made it an Apple Pencil and distinguishable.


Correct, it's a phone with stylus without pressure sensitivity


I feel like it should be $49 to be so gimped compared to a 4 year older model. It’s really just for schools and ignorant consumers I suppose.


But nothing that you quoted is catering to artists. Sketching is done by a lot of people that are not artists and just need to draw something without artistic intent.


Pro in the context of MacBooks means dramatically more powerful chips, much higher SSD ceiling, much higher RAM ceiling, larger screen options, better screen quality, much more robust cooling, HDMI, SD, and extra Thunderbolt/USB C.

More importantly, there are many applications that take advantage of all that extra headroom.

MacBook Pro is more than a vanity upgrade for people to get for no reason other than the fact they can afford it.


Also the previous comment was making the case that every step is designed to sell you on the next step up, and it sounds like you and I agree there isn’t really that much incentive to move from the iPad Air to the Pro


That’s fair, I wasn’t thinking about the larger screen iPad Pro


If 3 of those 6 can't be told apart in a showroom it's still more than it should be.


I agree in parts. This new Apple Pencil makes sense, it’s an alternative for people that only want note taking and not art.  
  
However much of this problem was created by Apple because the 10th gen iPad was released and the 2nd gen Apple Pencil was already available.  
  
If they discontinued the 9th gen iPad when releasing the 10th gen (as they usually do) and added support for the 2nd gen Apple Pencil, released this new Apple Pencil with it, then it would be a lineup that makes sense.


>Theres a very clear future where all iPads support both pencils, and the option is do you want pressure sensitivity or not. If you’re just taking notes (education) you probably don’t care.

I wouldn't call it a clear future unless Apple brings magnetic pencil charging to all the iPads that support pressure sensitivity. A 10th-generation iPad can't charge the Apple Pencil 2nd generation.


you seem to be struggling with how words work


Because they made it cheaper.


> why not??

Money.


I mean the 15 PM also has significantly faster transfer speeds and longer battery life.

Point is, the iPhone Plus is essentially just a bigger iPhone, while the Pro Max isn’t just a bigger Pro.


> You can’t simultaneously ask for better battery life while also having the device do more at the same time, especially with a device like a stylus.

Why not?

The surface pen was smaller than the Apple Pencil, used a replaceable AAAA battery, and lasted over a year with heavy use. *And* had more features.


>how would you be able to produce haptics that would feel good to the majority of users while also not impeding their workflows?

You do it subtly - nothing overly strong, so having a large haptic motor like what a phone has isn't necessary.

>Most people likely aren’t looking to have their pen/stylus vibrate in their hand while using it

Writing on paper has vibration - it's not very much, I'll grant you but it's there and does change depending on how much pressure you're using to write.

I've got both an iPad Pro/Pencil Gen 2 and a Surface Pro 8/Slim Pen 2, which does have haptic feedback (not in all apps, though!) and  to me that combination is a superior feeling writing/drawing experience to the iPad.


You will want Taptic feedback for a squeeze to activate actionring


They very much could! 

The reason they haven't is cause, well - they haven't identified a need to that would justify the expense.

Plus, it's very possible that to do so would require a change in form factor like how the Surface pen went from a more 'pen like' shape to one that resembles a carpenter's pencil.


A digital pencil with no pressure sensitivity is brain dead. It's limited to taking notes. Even taking notes would likely be better with pressure sensitivity. It's just so brain dead, for an $80 pencil it makes no sense.


To quote The Rock “IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT APPLE SAYS”


I guess I should rephrase, if it has Touch ID, it’s the 1st gen.


What is this? Stack exchange?


Renaming the iPad Air “iPad” would be insanely confusing to the layman. Better to have iPad SE, iPad Air (8.3 and 10.9) and iPad Pro (11 and 12.9)


I’ve heard rumors about the Pencil Pro Max so I’m gonna hold off.


“Air” has no real meaning anymore. They should just cut it and go with branding like the iPhone. It’s not like the iPad Air or the MacBook Air are these ultra thin devices like the first versions. It’s just pure branding at this point.

So just let us have iPad SE, iPad, iPad Pro and iPad Pro Max (and iPad Mini). And then drop the iPad SE to a reasonable price point, where schools can afford. They raised the price of the base iPad 10th gen (which should be iPad SE) by 120 dollars, but did they really provide that much more over the previous gen?

And please let’s start to have some more consistency in the product lines. Like the 10th gen iPad having the camera in the correct position, but then the subsequently released Pro’s didn’t.

The old thing with Apple where you could say “it just works”… well it doesn’t apply to the iPad product line. The 10th gen iPad that doesn’t support 2nd gen pen, the new pen that doesn’t charge magnetically even though it does have magnets, etc…

And we haven’t even talked about the mess with the keyboards, where not all keyboard work with iPads of similar size.

I shouldn’t care so much, and not like I’m losing sleep over it, it’s just a bit annoying and I hope that the choice is more clear for when I one day choose to upgrade my current iPad.


At the time, Apple offered like 30 models of Apple II. That’s why he simplified it. 

Now it’s just 3 models with different screen sizes or capacity.


And the G4 Cube


> when they're turned off

So is every device ever with the same form factor because there's no need to change the outside appearance of a device that has more memory or is faster or has additional hardware/software functionality that is internal.


What gives is people don't use their devices turned off. ProMotion and Face ID are often a good enough reason for people to jump from the Air if they need more than 64GB


They need a budget model. Or at least schools and those on a budget too.

The Air is too expensive and internally is similar to the Pro's so might be overkill for that demographic.

I don't mind the lineup as is (minus the old lightning model) because it caters to all demographics.

What I despise is the storage options.

The 10th gen should NOT start at 64 gigs. I highly doubt storage is that expensive for Apple and some students/families can't afford the upgrade. Apple probably has great margins on the iPad already so just bite the bullet and offer a single model at 128GB or something.

Same goes for the Air. It's ridiculous that you're either going for 64GB or 256GB with no in-between. I know it's Apple's way of nudging people into the base iPad Pro but I don't see why they have to resort to such tactics.

Because otherwise the iPad lineup could genuinely be perfect.

Base for budget-conscious and schools, mini for those who just want a smaller tablet, iPad Air for those who want the power of the Pro's in a more affordable package (e.g. college students and average consumers), and the Pro's for professionals or those who want the higher refresh rate display.


Too important for schools and kids. Probably their best seller.


Or call the base model the iPad SE


nope they need a cheaper model.


Base model  is <$400, can often be found on sale for <$300. Air isn’t getting close to that price.


Yea.

They changed plans


True, good point. I can understand why Apple doesn’t release a full set of iPads every year like they do with the phones, though. They definitely don’t sell anywhere near as many of them and there isn’t really as much reason to upgrade (camera). But maybe they would benefit from aligning on only one yearly release date for iPads and then release whatever number of iPads they feel like would be sellable at that time.


Most people can not notice the lack of pencil 2 support either.


>	has an Apple logo on it

Apple gets away with a lot by doing this. If this stylus was from, say, Google the media would be ripping them to shreds.


Apple? They sell a polishing cloth for $20. In what world would a Pencil ever be that low lol


I feel like every accessory should be $50 less tbh


[deleted]


iPad Air still only has a 60hz screen right? I was looking for an iPad to control my smart home and as a daily Pro user for work I couldn’t stand looking at the 60hz screen on the Air.


Sure, it’s too many. But my point is that it’s not complicated

Guy below blocked me lmao


> If they discontinued the 9th gen iPad when releasing the 10th gen (as they usually do) and added support for the 2nd gen Apple Pencil, released this new Apple Pencil with it, then it would be a lineup that makes sense.

Practically speaking, the 9th generation model is "iPad for Education". I absolutely agree that the message on all of this would have been substantially more clear if this 3rd-gen Pencil had been introduced alongside last year's iPad models. 

This is just speculation, but I have to assume that Apple planned new iPad models this year, and that this new Pencil would be introduced and announced as backwards compatible with the previous year's (10th-gen) iPad.


> I wouldn't call it a clear future unless Apple brings magnetic pencil charging to all the iPads that support pressure sensitivity. A 10th-generation iPad can't charge the Apple Pencil 2nd generation.

Right, a 10th-generation can't. But I'd be very surprised if an 11th-generation model doesn't gain this ability. Unless Apple is repositioning the base iPad as aimed solely at education, and it is limited to the basic Pencil with every other iPad in the lineup (mini, Air, Pro) having the option of Pencil/Pencil Pro.


You would see it that way, struggling with reading context and comprehension.


Is it really cheaper to make another complete SKU that is *almost* the same as the regular Pencil? Is a usb-c port and a complex sliding cap really cheaper than wireless charging coils?

Yes, I'm sure that in some Apple accountant's figuring it is, but the overall picture is that Apple doesn't have any idea what their iPad strategy is. (I say this as a huge Apple - and iPad - fan).


oh good, that's what apple should be getting into, cheap garbage.


Guess what no one is going to force you to buy one.


Nope. Because the iPad Air and iPad mini have Touch ID and uses the 2nd gen.


They've messed up their words. There are too many, and they aren't used consistently.

Max is a size for iPhone, but it's speed on M chips, and a whole product on the Watch.

Pro is a higher product tier on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, but it's lower-end on the M chips with Max and Ultra being the high-tier products.

Ultra is above Max on the M series. So Max isn't the max, and max should never mix with Macs.

I agree with you about Air. It would be a great label for the bottom-left of their famous [quadrants](https://www.casestudyinc.com/apples-four-quadrant-product-grid/), which they should review. iPad could benefit from this level of clarity.

jeeze bro it's 0.03 pounds lighter

Crazy how similar those two columns are  


It's the M1 chip and the screen for $200 basically


>It’s not like the iPad Air or the MacBook Air are these ultra thin devices like the first versions.


The OG MBA was 1,9 cm as far as I can determine. The 2020 Air 1,61cm at the thickest. The 2022 model is 1,13cm.

I don't really see how you can claim the first version was ultra thin and the new ones are not?


You’d likely ask someone why they’d have two iPads of the same size, while you don’t ask why they would have a 13 inch Pro and a Mini as it is clear that they’ll serve different goals. Also, with how limited iPadOS is, the three 11-inchers would look hard to distinguish even when they’re on.


Apple runs at 40% margins. It’s no secret. That’s across all lineups so they may be running 20% on MacBooks and 70% on iPads and 90% on accessories. But average is 40 points. But as long as they’re selling they’ll keep making them. 64 is frustrating as a homeschooling dad my 4 kids have to keep moving stuff on and off their iPads to accommodate different programs throughout the year. So we started getting 128 at Costco and will replace them over time.


> I don't see why they have to resort to such tactics

It made money, that's it. God if Steve Jobs is still alive (ironic because he's an atheist afaik?) he would never let these happen


> The Air is too expensive and internally is similar to the Pro's 

What?

They are all internally similar


It also lowers their “starting at” price.


Also good for showcases


My bad. Didnt know the price difference was that big.


Google doesn’t have 5 tablet models where this pencil would connect to and automatically pair seamlessly in a second. 

Google is basically catching up to the iPhone 8/x era in terms of actual product lineups that have a distinctive Google ecosystem feel to it imo


When it’s an actual \#2 lead Apple Pencil


I think those are not unique to artists. Have you ever needed to draw something simple for someone to understand or as a reminder/schematic, etc? That’s sketching and everybody does it. I can see how you think it could be misleading, it’s just that I personally don’t think it is.


Your point is nonsense.


coming from the person who doesn't know what the word Reign means lol


You forget cheaper iPads don’t have charging coils.


Cheaper for the user, US$50 less than the "pro" one (2nd gen).


> Is a usb-c port and a complex sliding cap really cheaper than wireless charging coils?

If you have to ask that you are woefully unqualified to be asserting that Apple made the wrong choice here. 

(spoiler: yes, on a $20 BOM part, inductive charging adds $5-$7 over USB-C, which would be about $25 more at retail. If the low end pencil was $100 people would be even more upset)


It also does not have the tilt functionality of the 1st and 2nd generation pencils. In all intents and purposes this is a downgrade from the 1st gen pencil aside of USB-C and magnetic attaching.


You must take angry notes.


Oh, great points, I fully agree about the words.

I don’t think those quadrants make much sense anymore either. Even the example they gave in 2012 as a “modern” one, had the iPad as the desktop equivalent to the iPhone…

If you want to talk about (completely unrealistic) ideals, I honestly wish they would launch two of each, every year, in two different sizes, and each with the exact same specs, so all I have to decide is which size is right for me. Call them [product] and [product plus] or something. Keep the lineup from last year and the year before to offer lower prices last years lineup and the one from the year before to offer lower price tiers. This could work for both iPhone, iPad and Mac. Not so sure about the Mac Mini, Mac Studio and how it fits with the processor SKUs.

This would probably mean that the prices for the latest and greatest would have to be lower, because if there was a big price cut after a year, a lot of people would just wait.

Apple is making huge profit, so financially it should be viable, while still making profit, but obviously they won’t do it, because why would they say no to money, they’re a company with shareholders. As a consumer, though, one is allowed to dream.


Thanks for the link. Yes and the right to buy a different pen and keyboard if you ever switch to a different iPad.

The Air moniker has never meant anything with the iPad.

Take a look at a comparison with the 1st gen iPad Air:
https://www.apple.com/ca/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-10th-gen,ipad-air-5th-gen,ipad-air-1st-gen

I was going to write that it doesn’t mean anything for MacBook any longer, like it used to, but I was very wrong about that.
Here’s a comparison between the MB Pro, MB Air 2022 and the MB Air 2017:
https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/?modelList=MacBookPro-13-M2,MacBook-Air-M2,MacBook-Air-2017

And here’s one with the original MB Air 2008, the 2010 11 inch version and the 2022 again:
https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-comparison-chart/?compare=all-intel-macs&highlight=0&prod1=MacBookAir001&prod2=MacBookAir007&prod3=MacBookAir043

I forgot how thick the original was, closest to the hinge.
And the latest is actually lighter weight than the original!, as well as both the Pro and the 2017 Intel.

Perhaps it’s because I’m remembering the 11 inch version, I was really fascinated by that and really wanted to buy it, but couldn’t afford at the time.


I was wrong :) - see my other comment


Why are you going around questioning other people’s tech inventory?


The 128 Pro?


I think about this every time Apple shies away from cannibalizing their own sales and ends up with a sprawling, confusing lineup.

Jobs was big on three tiers - good, better, best - and was willing to discontinue products at the drop of a hat if they didn't fit anymore.  New Apple is terrified of discontinuing anything, and just keeps adding tiers.  

It's logical, at the scale they're doing it.  Obviously there are markets for each tier of iPad, however many there are.  But I liked Jobs' commitment to simplicity.


Baseline iPad and iPad mini use “older” A-series chips.

The Air and Pro models use the Mac M-series chips. With the Air being one model behind the iPad Pros.

While the A chips are definitely more than enough for the average user, they’re not identical to the M chips.


Fine, use Microsoft as an example then. You know the product lines or lack thereof is not the point I was making.


I guess you didn't understand what I was saying the first time, so I guess i'll try again.

If you no not why guy say thing, you no not why no sense.


Fair enough. Kind of illustrates the point though - even for the fairly well informed, you need a flow chart to keep track of the iPad lineup.


It does have the tilt functionality, what it lacks is pressure sensitivity and wireless charging capability. That’s why is $50 cheaper. 

I don’t think it’s meant to replace the 2nd gen one but to offer a cheaper version and discontinue the lightning version.


Air on iPad has always meant laminated displays


Ah yes the good ol MB Pro itself was a BEAST. I only had one, 2012 version I think. Still works, I upgraded RAM and eventually added SSD. I mean it's so slow in weird software ways and just many apps don't work, Zoom is hilariously limited in features and the camera quality is hilariously potato.   


Hard to realize how much changes in a decade, sometimes, and how fast that time moves!


The A chips are more than enough. 

They can render multiple 1080 streams simultaneously. On an iPad. 


I will die on the hill that no one needs M series level of processing power on an iPad... if you are using that, you are doing it wrong. 

*maybe that will change with vision pro?


so you also don't know the difference between know and no, man english is not your forte.


It's almost as if your struggles with context make it easier to lead you to believe things that aren't true...

I think some people might be getting confused by “3rd party” here, it’s a bit of a misleading headline.

If you watch the video, they’re not using some Chinese display replacement, they’re pulling an OEM screen from another iPad to do the repair, and they aren’t able to draw straight lines even though it’s an Apple part.

If they transplant the display microchip from the original broken one onto the OEM replacement they are using, the screen then works perfectly.


There are a myriad of ways to f over users of 3rd party hardware and Apple has a team specializing in it.


Can’t or won’t?


“It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.”


Some companies innovate. Others drag their entire industry down.


Damn these third party iPad screens turning the pens gay! ✊


Just buy another one! /s 

But for real, that's what Apple wants.  It's a luxury product they convinced everyone that they must have it.  Now you have it.  Now you can pay out the ass, too.


I LOVE DRM ON MY iHOUSE


Dick move.


Classic asshole Apple move.. 💩


I knew I had reason to be weary about getting my cracked screen repaired


I know it’s an easy conclusion but it logically does not make sense. 

Think about how Apple DRM's its parts and how the user experiences that form of silly DRM.  

It’s always through messaging and disabled functionality. This is not that. 
This is a telltale sign of digitizer lacking proper calibration or missing calibration altogether. 

An easy and just as plausible scenario is: The old chip has calibration values (from the old screen). 

The new chip is possibly identical but has no calibration values at all. When swapped with the old chip it performs better because the calibration values from the old screen exist. Through margins of error being relatively low in mass production - not zero - you’ll see straight lines that may still not be perfect but better compared to no calibration whatsoever. 

Apple are easy to hate, but this report is likely an overly exaggerated take. It’s a good story and obviously generates clicks. 

So it's not malicious, just not designed for repair. Hanlon's razor applies here somewhat.


Dicks


Am I the only one who can't actually see the issue described in the video?


literally overpriced proprietory garbage, for every 10 reasons to buy an apple product there are 100 reasons not to buy them.


In the end what is happening here is the SN of the display does not match the calibration info stored on the SOC so the system runs without any calibration.   


When you switch the controle chip to the new display then the SN matches so it uses the old calibration, and most of the sensors are very smilier so using the old calibration means you get a much better result than using no calibration.    


I suppose apple could (maybe should) offer 2 things:  


1) Option to use a calibration profile even if the SN does not match  
2) Allow the device to download the correct profile form apples servers even if apple do not approve the agreeing of SOC and display. (perhaps with the limitation that this is not possible if the display was paired to a device now reported as stolen or iCloud locked)  


Apple a few years ago moved to putting all calibration info for sensors cloud side and having the diagnostic mode download this from apples servers when the server agrees on the pairing of SN to SOC.    


This change was likly a cost saving measure to simplify the production calibration stage, instead of needing to have an extra station in the factory to write the calibration info to the display controler chip they can skip this by just reading the SN and saving the profile in the cloud.  It also might let them have much smaller/cheaper little controler state chips as they only need to store a SN not an entire profile.  one display SN can then be used for color profile, touch, pencil profiles.


Built in obsolescence. Try this in France and if it happens there you have a massive lawsuit that you'll probably win.


How is this legal?


#FUCK APPLE

Just like with the newer iphones. Can't swap OEM Apple parts from a different phone to repair. Everything will start malfunctioning as soon as you put parts from a different Iphone in. Fuck Apple.
https://youtu.be/K2WhU77ihw8


Such a fucking needless dick move


Maybe if you used a ruler, you would have straight lines


Keep buying that stuff, they will continue to add more "features".


Very on brand - always ahead of the curve.


Can't or won't?


Thank the people who continue to buy their products and support them. If you support wannabe dictatorship be it country or company, well there goes your consumer rights and freedoms.


The simple explanation here is that each batch of screens has slightly different calibration, and just swapping screens (even between identical-looking iPads) without also performing a calibration step gets you bad results.

Also, Apple isn't this subtle when it comes to the things they intentionally control. If it was DRM they'd just lock it out from working.


ITT: people who will never be affected crawling out from under their rock to bash Apple.


And yet, people will still defend Apple and their bullshit products. Even if this is a calibration issue, Apple is intentionally holding back recalibration. Fuck Apple. I'll never buy any of their shit because of their anti-right-to-repair tactics.


What’s up with that??? They barely draw straight on their own overpriced devices


If this is your biggest problem, there is a bigger problem.


OR "Third party replacement iPad screens unable to properly accept input from Apple Pencil"


I honestly have no idea why someone would buy an apple product. Why would you subject yourself to being treated like this as a consumer?


Hahahaha, Apple suckers.


“I think” “I heard” “somewhere” about “something” that “someone” “proved” that Apple does this on purpose because they “hate” their customer. 

Good job, Reddit tech detectives, cracked another case! lol


Queue the Apple ~~fanbois~~ customers ~~coping~~ explaining why it is like that in a ~~blind rage~~ respectful dialogue.


Third party replacement screens... are a gadget?


I don't get why OEMs are allowed to design products anymore if they're going to make things so difficult to re-engineer and repair. The government should be in charge of all hardware and software design.

Wow after trying to give apple the benefit of the doubt then I read the details in the comments and WOOOOOWWWWWWW HOW PETTY CAN YOU BE!!!??!!  So its the same S# and all that jazz its because it wasnt DoNe At aN aPpLe StOrE?! A WRITING TOOL AND ONE USED FOR EDUCATION AND DISABLED PEOPLE?!?! What timeline is this?!


Apple has the courage to do this.


can’t, or won’t?


Is the screen not created to be used with pencil? 

So unless the third parties are going to make screens that are calibrated to the pencil you will have to replace it with Apple. 

The company wants to make things that feel like magic, it’s not actually magic lol. Random part replacement cannot be expected to “just work”


This sounds about right. Apple uses special hardware to calibrate their replacement screens on phones & ipads. 

Unauthorized 3rd party repairs/mods or stolen part franken-devices will not function as they should.


Add this to the list boys. Damn is EU gonna have a though time literally telling apple how to do not shady sht.


Definitely a r/winstupidprizes situation. If you're dumb enough to buy apple products at this point, you get what you deserve.


Excellent. That’s an infringement on monopoly laws I’m pretty sure.


This is specifically with a third party display, i.e. one not made by Apple. No one knows the quality of it and if it even has the same capabilities as the original display.

Parts pairing is anticonsumer bs, but try this with an OEM display before we raise our pitchforks about this.


Then draw better lol


Man imagine getting a 3rd party replacement screen? 😂


Hitler was a bad person


That looks as good as how I freehand draw straight lines.  Are we sure it's not the user?


old ass “news”


Yeah, I was having issues with paperlike


Either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain…..


You just have to take the chip from the old screen snd install on the replacement.  Or, there’s probably a software fix— somewhere the OS is checking the chip.


it's not that they can't, it's that they're designed not to. It's all part of apples monopolisation of the apple repair market


Nothing straight about Apple


But but Apple loves the environment, pushing people to buy new instead of repairing is more green 💵


That’s Funny ‼️


So the 3rd party repair shops can't do the repair correctly and this is supposed to be a reason to hate Apple for it?


That implies to me the calibration is unique to each screen and a proper repair has a calibration setup step?


> If you watch the video, they’re not using some Chinese display replacement, they’re pulling an OEM screen from another iPad to do the repair,

So they’re using some Chinese display replacement.


*gasp* Apple being anti-consumer and forcing you into their eco-system without right to repair?  Say it isn't so.

Yet chodes will be brawling in the parking lot when the new iPhone, the most expensive modern smart phone ever, drops.


[deleted]


This is a pretty common way to check how apple handles repairs, get two new iphones and swap the bits and see what breaks. There's a guy on youtube that does just that every time a new iphone comes out.


Apple has been serializing parts for a while now. You can't just replace one part with another part from the same device. That doesn't lead you to throwing away your device and buying a new one.

If apple could get away with it? Apple devices would be pre charge from the factory and you'd just have to throw your device away for a new one once it was dead.

Apple is VERY anti repair. They want those devices in a landfill as soon as possible so you buy the next model.

I assure you, this is coded in to make it look like 3rd party repair fucked it up.


It appears that the functionality is determined by the microchip rather than the originality of the display screen.


[deleted]


I didn’t read the article either don’t worry


Not including a stand for their $5000 monitor is one that stands out.  Charging $500  for that stand, $1000 for the pro version, is another.  The monitor was supposedly worth the $5K but in what world is a stand worth 20% of the cost of your high def monitor.


There are a myriad of ways to fuck over their own users as well.    
E.g. https://youtu.be/4TNTO_eWWhw?si=8CnnZAvdwNOGsj4Y.   

User takes working phone to Apple "Geniuses", they break the display flex and tell the user "we broke it, deal with it". Refers them to a shitty data recovery partner who quotes them >$3000 to recover data.   
The fix was actually a new screen, WHICH APPLE STOCKS AND OFFERS AS A SERVICE!    
Unbelievable.


It has a chip taht if it doesn't read (because screen been replaced), it will intentionally start acting weird


Don’t.


you don’t become a $3T company by being generous. 
 
(with that said I love my macbook and iphone to the ends of the earth, idk)


Lawful evil innovation.


You are a bit confused, Apple is an electronic company like any other, but they have a luxury brand marketing.


still prefer them over any company that makes an insane profit with my data


Let's assume Apple is benevolent.

They could simply publish a screen calibration app.  Maybe it's in the app store, or maybe it's with the phone but only shows up when a new screen is detected.  They have no problem alerting the user when the battery is replaced and blocking access to the battery info after all.

Or they could automatically download the calibration info from the cloud when a new serial number is detected instead of putting time and money into custom software and devices for "pairing" a repaired screen.


You'll have to prove this is actually planned obselesence and not plain old miscalibration.

People in this comment section (and the ArsTechnica comment section) are clueless. They don't understand that tiny differences in EM interference create wavy diagonal lines.

Thick screen protector? Wavy lines. Changed to a non-standard nib? Wavy lines. This is true with every electrostatic digitizer, not just Apple Pencil.

People seem to think wavy lines couldn't possibly be the fault of a tiny miscalibration...


I'm French and I can tell you, this is already happening here since a decade with Apple and absolutely NOTHING has been done!

Apple has so much money and so much influence, they get lobbyists to influence our politics so nothing against them is done.

Just take a look at the "indice de réparabilité" a new system which came out last year and was approved by Apple. It gives on every device a note on /10, 1/10 being very difficult to repair and obtain the parts, 10/10 being very easy to repair and get the parts.
They gave an 8/10 mark on a MacBook Pro from a few years ago that is well known to have a failure that come very often and necessitate a newer part which Apple isn't providing or at an absolute ridiculous price (I think it was a failure of the charger port).
So you have this thing which is a very good idea on the basic, but got so much lobbying by Apple and other anti-repair company that it is now near useless, and sometimes harmful since it will trick customer to think a device is easy to repair while it is not, so when it fails you'll either spend crazy amount of money to repair it with "Apple program" or just buy a new device. 

And yes we have some independent association like UFC Que Choisir, but they are in no match against Apple on a lawsuit.


man, this comment really showed them!

No offense bro, but that’s ANY company right now in capitalism.

If you want consumer rights then make your own devices and grow your own food. I see more hate for Apple than Nestle or even the printer industry which is 10x more predatory and creating a ton of e-waste. I could even argue that the way the internet and cable companies functions in the US is even more predatory than Apple and needs to be handled.

But fanboy wars tend to take priority over worse issues I guess.


“Sent from my iPhone”


But after they moved the microchip from the old screen to the new one it worked perfectly again. I assume that the calibration should be screen dependent, not logic board dependent. Is it not?


It was a genuine ipad screen


This.


Few people actually have issues with apple products 

The issues that do arise become mainstream such as this fringe case apple pencil issue. Normally they get fixed in a software update anyways.. this particular issue is likely software based. If not then its an issue with the third party screen because theres alot of precision calibration between the screen and the pencil needed..

Its fine to misunderstand tech but lets not assume its intended on Apples part


Yeah it's awful having high performing products with rock solid dependability that keeps resale value for a long time.


Because when something breaks, you take it to them and they fix it for free 90% of the time. Then after 4-5 years when you have no reason to expect fixes under warranty, they are reasonably priced to fix stuff.


iPads, and iPad pencils are


Thanks Gorbachev


What does this mean?


How about you read the article before trying to speak at the big boy table


How else would they remain the wealthiest company in existence and get away with using slave labor?


Akshually, it’s Frankenstein-devices monster…


Damn someone is brown nosing Apple hard enough to spew their bullshit.


You obviously either didn't read the article or didn't understand it.


if you actually bothered to even read the article instead of headline, you would know that they used a display screen from another iPad. First party parts but third party repair.


Man imagine not being able to read? 😂


This is not a 3rd party screen but a screen from another ipad. The 3rd party is the repair not the screen.


Show me a better way of saying I can't read.


The cheap knockoff sell by Apple. The repar is 3rd party the screen is from another Ipad.


Using a genuine apple iPad screen as a replacement is a cheap knockoff???

I work at an apple certified repair shop (Geek Squad) and all iphone screen replacements require a calibration through apple's system. I figure ipad screens are the same.


No, I think it's been proven before (demoed by Grossman IIRC) that Apple puts some kind of harware DRM that sabotages repairs even if you replace by a similar working unit from an official Apple product.


Calibration is necessary any time a display is changed, even when the display is from the maker. Think of it as the same as tearing the replacement brakes of your car even when they’re from the car maker. It’s more than just parts matching, it’s of the repair was done correctly, and are the parts communicating properly. It’s one reason Apple doesn’t repair iPad displays. It’s not an easy dice. And they always calibrate a new iPhone display even though it’s original. And the calibration machine is large, expensive, and takes most of the repair time. Source: did this job for several years.


I had to calibrate displays after replacement on iPhones when working for apple. I’d assume iPads are the same (we didn’t repair those in store)


Lmao some of the dipshits responding to you have me rollin 🤣


A non-calibrated display would show a straight line in the wrong place, offset by a fixed amount. This seems to be intentional.


Your fairly reasonable question of a comment has garnered some pretty ridiculous responses. It's interesting how one person expected you to come up with proof as if you're making some incredibly bold claim. 

I don't personally know how Apple products have been engineered. Yea, there's probably some stuff in those devices that is anti consumer by design. That's how these things work. They're a huge comfy corporation with technology so advanced the layman could never understand how badly they're being ripped off. They have to make their profits and appease the Shareholders. So throw in some planned obsolescence here and there and no one will be the wiser. 

But who's to blame here? Is it the Shareholders? The Engineering team? R&D? The CEO itself?  Nope. It's us! We consume and consume and consume. Apple figured it out. Apple is simply one of the shiniest diamonds hardened by the crushing weight of it's capitalist society. 

Perhaps it truly is a big smoke and mirrors ploy to make repairing devices impossible. Or maybe, ya know, the thing needs to be calibrated. Who the fuck cares. We're gunna buy the fuckin' thing anyways. 

All this to say...

I'm pretty stoned.

Edit:  I just had a thought. There's probably a good reason Apple keeps tight lipped about these things. Their tablet pens are pretty awesome ngl. There is probably some seriously ridiculous tech in those pens and in the screens to drive it all. If I was making first in class tech, I wouldn't want the secrets of how my products work out there in the world for everyone to copy. Bearing that in mind, I would not be surprised to learn that the pen and the screen micro chip doodad have some kind of pairing that makes them work correctly together.


That doesn't make sense. If the issue was screen calibration, then you wouldn't use the chip from the old screen, because that would have the calibration for the old screen. Swapping the chip would have made things worse instead of fixing the problem.


The calibration is stored on a chip attached to the screen.


Touchscreens and digitizers aren't magic. We've figured them out pretty well decades ago. If the parts are in spec calibration shouldn't really be necessary. They just don't want it to work.


Yes actually


Iphones and ipads are programmed to reject replacement parts without the proper calibrations


And you can only get proper calibrations in apple approved repair shops


Also said apple approved repaid shops are more likely to tell you to buy a new apple product.lmao


There was a whole youtube video about this


An implies the apple went out of their way to sandbag third party repairs


Protip: every iphone part is a chinese part.


But you don't understand, it's got a 7th camera and a 10% faster processor!!


Careful of the corporate white knights!
Did you even watch before commenting? If you had, you would've known that it they were able to draw normally after implanting the original display microcontroller onto the replacement screen, without additional calibration.
Please explain.


This isn't calibration, it's serialization. It's a completely different screen, with essentially a DRM chip. It only checks if the screen is connected to its original logic board. If the DRM chip is swapped in from the original screen, then it works. This is a basic anti-repair tactic.

How do you think swapping in a serialization chip could "fix" *calibration* on a new screen?

>independent repair shops just try to look at your nudes, and trying to repair anything yourself means your battery is going to explode - a really nice lobbyist lady said so

I hate how some people think like this. Even my own wife was arguing with me on the verge of tears about her accounts being compromised when we took a 2019 iPad for repair to a local shop with a good online rating, I ended up using find my iPad to lock it remotely to try and allay her fears. She told me she wished we replaced it or took it to an apple authorised repair outfit (cost £299 fixed price, more than the device is worth). 

They fixed it for £50 within a day, from dead to fully functional. When I collected it they spent no time in any apps and find my iPad lock hadn't been activated since it hadn't been connected to any network. Those dudes are enabling us to get a couple of extra years out of something that would have become expensive ewaste.


No one got your sarcasm. Sad.


Almost got me lmfao


There is a huge world of theft out there. And not just stealing from you but from apple.  If someone takes a phone from region X, to region Y, they can exploit warranty laws and get the parts / product from apple.  This is what was explained to me and it’s a big enough problem to apples bottle line that they’ll fuck us to mitigate it.  
Is it better for us? Reducing waste and fraud will allow apple to … continue to make money and maybe even increase their gross profit margin. So, yes, it’s excellent for us shareholders.  Not for us as customers.


Could this be a calibration thing? Though that wouldn't fit what another commenter has said about the screen still working with just the chip transplanted...


They already have software to download it the issue is that server side it will not let you download the profile for an un expected pairing of SoC and display. 

As server side change that let you download profiles for screen as long as those screens are not associated with stolen devices is all that is needed.


It's genuinely amazing how many of apple's devices suffer from "miscalibration" issues when repaired.


They took the chip from screen A and put it in screen b, and suddenly screen b was working correctly. The only explanation is DRM.


so try it with the equivalent microsoft/samsung tabs and see if the same effect turns up?

> No offense bro, but that’s ANY company right now in capitalism.

You know how to make businesses move away from those practices? Choose the least evil. Supporting the worst offender only proves to the rest that that's the path to follow for maximum profit. If enough people said, "that's enough of that," they'd be forced to choose between anti-consumer practices and continuing to exist as a business.


It is absolutely intended. Apple has a long history of being anti repair and making it difficult to get repair work done at anywhere besides apple store locations.


What an apple fan thing to say. So what, it's like 5 people who broke their apple products just being really noisy about it? Or a bunch of people breaking them on purpose so they can go "see? Apple sucks!" Like, this has been a topic of conversation since Apple put special screws I their product so you HAVE to come to them to fix it.  It's obviously intentional. But people who buy Apple products don't know how anything else works, and, in the US, apparently live in fear of a green SMS bubble. So we can't get anything else, and we'll convince ourselves that it's a superior product because it makes us feel better about it.


Yes dependability aside from all the known manufacturing issues bundled with the anti repair stance of the company. I don’t doubt their performance. And the resale value is entirely perception based. Apple computers aren’t any better than other comparable machines


do you own an iphone? or any cellular device for that matter?


I merely spoke on the current state of their hardware repairs. How is that interpreted as brown nosing?


Bruh I did read the article. Your reading comprehension must not be top notch. Let me explain it for you. 

The article literally says it was a third party iPad screen: “Reports from repair shops and customers suggest that Apple Pencils no longer work properly on **non-genuine** Apple screens”

The part of the article that said even swapping screens between two devices that you mention was about iPhones, as it directly states:

“echoes an issue that arose with the then-new **iPhone 13** line in 2021. Repair techs found that replacing the screen, even with a genuine Apple screen with the Face ID module laboriously transferred over (but not paired by Apple's proprietary software), would disable Face ID on the device”

Emphasis mine.


No it’s not, read the article.


It’s not genuine, the article says “non-genuine apple screens”


You collect legos lmao


Like inkjet manufacturers and the chips in the replacement cartidges.


I don't really understand why Apple aren't constantly hit by anti-trust lawsuits.


Isn't point of calibration that even in the same model of the input device, there are variances that you have to even out with calibration? That would make sense in this case. Perhaps they calibrate with a dense mesh that makes sure you get your lines straight.


This could very well be a calibration issue. Calibration exists because there are different levels of error even when you're comparing the exact same screen and hardware. I whole-heartedly believe Apple is a shit company but until I see more evidence that this was malicious, I will assume the most obvious thing.


Maybe it still is? If the iPad itself has the calibration data perhaps it is stored for a given screen serial. If you install a screen with a different serial you get no calibration, if you swap the chip you’d get the old one but if you’re lucky the two screens behave similarly enough that it works out.

If Apple wanted to prevent unauthorised replacements they would have no reason to cause erratic behaviour, they could just disable it.


This is not how things work. Just because the parts are "identical" (like same model) does not mean they they perform the same. This is the whole point of calibration.


Wow that’s fascinating. Can you share actual evidence of this so I can take a look?  

Don’t worry about being too technical, I am an investigator with over twenty years of both hardware and software engineering experience.


I mean, when I replace my tires (and do a balance) on the car I don't expect it to be able to drive safe! /S


No offense but you have no idea what you're talking about. No two pieces of hardware are identical. Even if it's the same exact part, there's going to be manufacturing differences that make each perform differently. For example, monitors need to be calibrated so that they display the same color and brightness across different screens. I bought two identical monitors at the same time, from the same place and there's a noticeable difference in how each renders color because they were cheap and aren't calibrated. With the same image and same settings, an orange on one might appear browner on one or yellower on the other monitor. 

A lot of these manufacturing differences can be compensated for in software. In the monitor example, you can use a different mapping to tell it to display certain tones differently to compensate for the differences in each display. It's certainly possible that Apple is doing that here to compensate for any variances in the digitizer. 

For what it's worth, I think Apple should have built in methods to calibrate their screen accessible (but hidden under a giant pile of menus) to the end user. I don't believe, without further evidence that this is done out of spite. There's already plenty of cases where they do that, we don't need to make up another. 

All of this is coming from a pure Android user in case you think I'm biased towards Apple.


That is just a theory that you are presenting as fact. You have no idea what’s going on with the hardware.


'messing'?  I think the word you are looking for is sabotage.


What if the calibration is stored on the main board. Not the screen associated chip.


So glad I quit using iphones. At this rate I'll only be using the Apple TV. Completely bizarre that apple has become this user hostile. As if they're deathly afraid of losing their place among consumers and they're holding on for dear life. The whole thing smells like desperation which makes no sense at all.


Then why does it work fine if you also transplant the display chip? 

You are saying that apple is devious enough to create a 'fuck up drawing straight lines' function to mess with the 1% of users who are heavy pencil users + need a new screen, but too stupid to extend their misbehavior to the display chip?

The calibration hypothesis is *far* more likely


Is this a factual thing that there is no calibration off the screen in the chip or is this your speculation?


God you just love talking out of your ass don't you

Ok so let's break it down, the chip they accuse of being serialized is the DP825, this likely refers to the parade technologies DP chip line with integrated touch controller

You can look up parade DP818, DP825 is very likely a custom apple variant of said chip

Ok so what's a touch controller?

A touch controller will translate physical touches into digital signals, given that's it's a capacitive touchscreen it does this by detecting changes in current, and it will output a location and other information to the CPU

Now a touch controller does need calibration, even the slightest variation in detected current can mean the "detected" position is off.

I work in the display industry myself and we also integrate touchscreens, EVERY touchscreen that leaves our factory is calibrated and every new screen replacement is recalibrated

So what these guys did is only replace the (touch)screen itself without updating the calibration that resides on that chip, then when they transfer the chip it seems to work perfectly

Of course! It's the chip containing the calibration data to correctly translate physical input to digital signals, this has NOTHING to do with serializing the part

If it's not possible to calibrate your display yourself, apple should absolutely provide this functionality, but it has nothing to do with them explicitly "disabling" it


You don’t realize how much calibration contributes to the working of components like screen and cameras. The same voltage applied to screen A and screen B can have a tremendous difference in final pixel shown on screen. Calibration provides a mapping between intended pixel color and the specific voltage needed on this specific screen to show such a color. Btw screens don’t usually store serial numbers, the chips attached to them does. According to your logic shouldn’t the iPad stop drawing straight lines AFTER they realized they are dealing with a new screen chip?


While I could see Apple sabotaging third-party repairs, since they've done it before, the fact that the Pencil largely works but doesn't quite draw straight suggests the per-screen calibration is the reason. 

I don't think this is a tinfoil hat moment.


Admittedly, it was a while ago, but I used to work for Apple replacing screens on iPhones. There was a machine used to calibrate the screens. It’s explicitly explained purpose was to get all the calibration data for the digitizer to jibe with the phone such that it would register touch in the correct places. Not calibrating the screen after replacing it would — based on my anecdotal and in no way scientific tests — result in the indicated location of touches to not match actual ones. This was with all original Apple branded parts and with official Apple equipment, test software, and procedures. The hardware isn’t identical. There’s small variations in manufacturing that need to be accounted for.

I don’t see why screens on an iPad would be any different. Heck, I’d expect it to be more noticeable given the size of the thing, especially with a much more precise instrument like an Apple Pencil as compared to a human digit.


Unless the calibration is unique to each batch of screens, and so the "identical" hardware still needs to be calibrated again.


I agree. I was 100% Apple until about two years ago and I am reducing the number of Apple products I have, competition is good


This is why I don't fuck with Apple if I don't have to.


5s? Homie Apple has been hardware locking their shit from almost day 1. It was one of the biggest reasons to avoid their PCs. Old OSes (haven't touched a Mac in over 10 years because of stuff like this) would do something between throw a fit and brick themselves if you put non-Apple hardware in your PC.


Do you have even the slightest proof about this?


Never heard of John Deere I see


Shit like this is why I don't understand why people will still buy apple. I'm not saying android or whatever is all that much better, but at least it's not Apple.


You sound like you don't know what you're talking about. Car manufacturers need calibrating their front cameras for lane assistance after installing new windshields even though the parts are identical, there is still tiny variations in thr glass enough to make an impact on cameras refraction. Calibration for these displays is most likely the true reason for this issue.


Touch id proved this and face id has also.


Correct.  This is sabotage.


“I think”, “by someone”, “if I remember correctly”… typical Reddit tech commentary lol 

Prove it. Prove anything. 

There are literally BILLIONS of iPhones in the world, and millions of people have the skills to test these these things on a work bench. 

These are extremely simple tests even for a first year EE tech with a basic workbench. 

So please show us this data. Don’t worry about it being too difficult to understand, I’ve worked in many hardware labs and would to see it.


This sort of stuff is just one of the reasons I switched to an Android phone last year but the experience has been so bad that I'm probably going back to iPhone when this cycle is over. Can't win.


It absolutely does not


Depends on how the sensors work, there is no reals a non calibrated sensor would just have a x,y transition that is uniform across the display.  The tracking sensor is not a single sensor on x and another on y there are many many sensor points throughout the display, if the calibration is off for any one of these then you would expect a line that has ransoms squiggles within it just like this video.


No the chip attached to the screen just includes a small ID number the calibration info is stored on apple's servers and can be pulled onto the SOC when in diagnostic mode however apples servers do not provide that info unless it is an approved paring.  If the IDs do not match what the SOC expects then no calibration profile is applied and you get the raw sensor data.      


it is much cheaper to have a simple read only SN attached to the screen, do the calibration in the factory and save this info to a server than have a much more complex controler chip on the screen that supports writing the info to later and have the tooling setup in the factory to do this post calibration.


Decades ago? What devices shipped with capacitive touch screens >20 years ago? What devices shipped with separate stylus and non-stylus touchscreens >20 years ago?

Wacom was the only provider of pen only touch screen systems that I’m aware of pre-2003. I’ve never seen a Wacom touchscreen that worked with a resistive or capacitive touch screen. And Wacom tablets that worked with displays had significant parallax error. 

I’ve been using touch screen / stylus computers since 1994. I can assure you that it was _not_ a solved problem in the early 2000s.


Except for the Vietnamese or the Indian ones one the South Korean ones.


Hah hah.  You know it.

They were able to draw normally after implanting the replacement microcontroller associated with the replacement screen into the repaired iPad. Yes, this could be serialization. They could look for a serial code to check if it matches, then add in additional code to simulate a jitter in the Apple Pencil. Or the microcontroller could have flash ROM on it and be storing calibration information on its flash storage.

> chances are it's the junk tier component's problem

And people will think this because Apple is fucking over 3rd party repairs. If they let OEM parts work and did this to 3rd party only it'd be perhaps even more scummy and hidden.

Fuck Apple and their bullshit if any of this is accurate (and fuck 'em even if it's not for all their other anti-repair crap)


Not necessarily.. could just mean each screen is individually calibrated. The screen worked fine when the correspondent display chip was transferred over to the new device as well.




There's a massive industry repairing OEM displays to virtually brand new

New machines can do microsoldering with lasers so now 99% of displays can now be repaired

So the fact this is being done to OEM displays makes it WORSE and wasteful as fuck


> I hate how some people think like this.

I will just say that a local official repair lap (I won't say which company) in my country got a lawsuit (which they later settled) after an employee was sending himself nudes he found on customer phones entering repair.  
It happened a few years ago.  
  
So I won't say it is too far fetch.


Meanwhile, Apple techs have been caught doing exactly what your wife is afraid of.


Look at the last sentence of OPs post.


Except there have been legitimate news stories and arrests from people doing this. Not just at 3rd party but at apple too. You honestly cannot trust them


Studies have shown 50%+ of repair shops access the picture directories for female customers where they aren't doing the same for male customers. Guess what those techs are looking for?

Almost had me. This sub tends to eat up apple PR.


What's a bottle line? Is apple starting to make apple cider? Bout time they picked up that missed opportunity


It can't be a calibration thing. Simply swapping the ID chip to tell the logic board "this is the original screen" wouldn't fix a calibration thing.


I'm not sure, but it seems awfully convient that Apple always "unintentionally" end up with suspiciously unique and convoluted hardware set ups that happen to make fixing your own devices seem like a bad or unviable option!


Apple has a history of needlessly serializing components such as the battery or display solely to make repair more difficult for third parties. That chip is what allows them to detect if someone swapped things around. Swapping displays for example causes stuff like face id or true tone to just stop working iirc. Of course if you manage to move the chip it'll work fine. If it really was for calibration, it makes no sense that transplanting the calibration data for one component into another suddenly makes it work perfectly.


more likely an AIgorithim correcting thing, ie it doesnt correct using algorithim if correct serialized chip isnt used


how many devices have you personally had this exact issue happen on then?


Or... something was wrong/miscalibrated with Chip B.


That's actually a great test and I can tell you that merely using an older pen on a 9th-gen Surface device creates severely wobbly lines!


I used a Bellemond screen protector to draw on for 3 years and had straight lines. I also find the pencil misbehaves a lot more when I don't wear a drawing glove.


That’s like telling someone that the best way to stop climate change is to stop eating meat and stop using gas.

*I* can stop all I want to, I can do the best and most ethical alternatives around. But that won’t change that EVERYONE ELSE has to also do the same thing. That’s also not considering prices and convince that dictates where millions or even billions of people spend their money.

Pretty soon, I’m going to have to start printing on the regular. Am I going to go for the expensive niche refillable ink printers when I have several other expensive equipment to buy? No, I’m taking my ass to Walmart because it’s the only major store in my area because of Capitalism, and I’m buying the more affordable printer for my needs. Nothing I do will change anything outside of voting for people to end this shit and that’s only if everyone else votes too.

At the end of the day, I’m no better than the average consumer and the average consumer craves convience and savings.


History is not evidence.. you don’t know if its intended.


The same thing happens with all brands its not exclusive to apple just more common due to its sheer size and popularity. 

Also I use Apple and windows and have no fandom for any brand.. Fandom for a brand is insanely stupid as is hate for a brand..


Apple products in my personal life, Windows and Android products at work.


Please don’t be that stupid meme

“ I see you criticize the system yet you participate in the system. Interesting..”

This is a dumb meme argument

I got a used IPhone from a friend. Never even changed the ultra girly case on it. The fact that Apple is worth more then the entire British stock market is absurd. Right to repair should be allowed across America for anything. There would be no Apple with out that very basic. The fact that it was 2 guys in 1976 saying that everyone should have their own computer well the way to maximize that profit is apple gets to control the chip supply. Just add suicide nets, dash of slavery, baked in human rights abuses. Damned great phone no doubt. Just the road to get there is the sausage being made. So until then I’ll never buy a new apple product. Can’t wait for the mandated replaceable batteries and universal charger! 

Edit: Never buying new!


Because its not just "stolen" or "dodgy" parts effected. If you buy 2 BRAND NEW iPad Pro's and then swap the screens from one yo the other, these issues will still arise. It's extremely anti consumer. Its like if you bought 2 brand new Ford Fiesta's, swapped the wheels from one to another, and that resulting in your Fiesta being limited to 40MPH as a result.


it is watch the video. it starts by drawing green lines with the original screen which is broken and the lines are straight. After they take a new screen from another ipad and the red lines are irregular. and finally take the chip from the first screen and put it in the second and the blue lines are straight again.


Some people spend their free time collecting LEGO, some people spend their free time defending trillion dollar companies on the internet for free. We’ve all got hobbies.


Cause they pay off politicians so that they take the teeth out of government agencies like the FTC and others.


It's kind of wild that Lina Khan and the FTC have been chasing these weird tech mergers that are pretty big uphill battles. Meta and the workout company in particular, but also the more recent Activision MSFT lawsuit. Meanwhile apple is sitting over here with what look to me like legal slam dunks, RCS, USB C, right to repair. I'm no lawyer, so maybe the nuance of FTC jurisdiction is lost on me, but I wonder how the FTC is triaging the possible legal cases they pursue


Corporations tell the government what laws to make. Especially tech companies.


Because every wanna-be smart wanna-be rich person owns an iPhone and can't stop slobbering on apple's knob long enough to do anything.


Because the fantasies that random people have on Reddit about how technology works and the shadowy back room evil corporate overlords fall apart pretty quickly when actually investigated by people who do know how these things work.


Yes. Absolutely. That’s like what 99% of calibration is for. Screen colors are calibrated, speakers are calibrated, and touch screens are calibrated, across the same models.

And that’s the obvious Occam’s razor answer for this. Think about it: if it were a calibration-related issue, what would you expect to see? Slightly imprecise lines? Yes.

On the other hand, imagine Apple wanted to prevent people from replacing their screens with OEM replacements. What would they do? They would do what they did with Touch ID—literally prevent the hardware from functioning with the device. They wouldn’t deliberately program minor irregularities and then let people maybe notice. That’s just ridiculous.


Depends. Calibration data for the two paired devices may be in the cloud, rather than on-device/locally. That would make a lot of sense - simpler hardware.


Totally valid opinion, if putting in the chip that just says "here's an id number" didn't fix the issue. Right? I mean, that chip doesn't have some complicated calibration data on it.


However, this issue exists only with Apple devices. If there was such a massive batch variance in the displays to require per-display calibration, we would expect the same behavior with other display replacements, which we do not.


You can see in the video they claim the offending chip is the DP825, if this is a custom apple variant of the parade technologies DP818 and alike they're telling on themselves that they couldn't perform even the most basic googling, these types of chips are eDP controllers with INTEGRATED touch controllers, the calibration data is also stored on there.

Of course moving the chip with the TOUCHSCREEN CALIBRATION DATA  on it to the iPad having the touchscreen it was calibrated for makes the touchscreen work properly again


You have a sensible opinion. The person replying to you has the typical derpy Reddit opinion. 

The truth is Apple takes how their devices work extremely seriously, and causing random glitches in the user experience is anathema to them.


If it was a calibration issue, we'd have seen this on previous, non-serialised models. 

>If Apple wanted to prevent unauthorised replacements they would have no reason to cause erratic behaviour, they could just disable it.

If Apple want to avoid an anti-trust lawsuit, this may be their "solution" instead of disabling it. If it's just a coincidence, I'm sure they'll come up with a user friendly solution that allows people to swap the screen easily.


delusional... it's just apple being dicks, there is no other reason


This might sound crazy, so bear with me, but I'd imagine someone who has twenty years of investigative experience would be able to find their own sources if they cared about this? 

A new account defending an objectively shitty practice doesn't exactly inspire confidence in it not being astroturfing.


I do have an Idea what i am talking about. I have literally worked for Apple previously. I also had to sign an NDA or the equivalent in German Law, just like anybody else working for them does. I nowadays run a chain of independent Repair Shops in Germany that fixes these devices in the Hundreds daily. I am extremely effected by this. I know the technical part of this very well and have also done my research on it as well as have even had a thorough exchange with other repair shops about this. I know how this issue arises and i am very aware of this being nothing more than just another tactic of Apple to reduce Trust of Consumers in Third-Party Repair and to steer away from us and more towards Apple themselves.

Apples DisplayModules are NOT cheap monitors. They all have the exact same calibration and manufacturing standards. The only difference is a Serial Number inside the Touch Controller of these Display Modules that is paired to the motherboard. This issue arises once the device knows that the Serial Number of the installed part is different. You could literally change the serial with a screen programmer and cause it to show the same behaviour. Even though it would be the same exact part that the device originally came with.


As soon as you use the words: it's certainly possible, you have zero credibility. Apple has literally disabled face id, if you don't also move over the chip that shipped with the ORIGINAL screen, when a new screen is needed, similar to what other person was trying to say. That's a bunch of horseshit on apples part, the type of phone I use doesn't matter. Full stop.  Same thing they did with touch id way back when. It's not a calibration issue, it's a matter of hardware locking to get you to go to crapple only to get it "repaired" . Do better.


It could be some calibration getting moved over if they were switching a chip from the donor iPad into the one they're repairing, but it sounds like they're moving a chip from the broken iPad into the donor display. If the calibration was in that chip, it would be using the wrong one for the digitiser *after* the chip swap.


I'm sure you know better than the CEO of a repair company, because you changed some settings on a monitor.

Why does this only happen when replacing screens on Apple devices?


Found the apple employee


This didn’t go well for you


FWIW I think your skepticism was well founded - coming from the CV industry, same hardware != same calibration, cameras vary by many pixels. But alas GP's response explains why it's not the case here.


I wonder why Apple is the only phone manufacturer on the planet where this particular issue is a problem, and you can just swap in an identical screen on other devices with no issues like this.

Or why it happen with other apple components like the iphone camera. I believe Louis Rossman did a video on that one.

Weird.

(They do this on purpose)


Then the screen should work normally even after i change the serial number of the original screen, it does not though. It shows the same behaviour as a third party screen


Yes that is exactly what i am saying. And as i have mentioned already = Same Serial Number of the Screen->no issues
Different Serial Number = Issues

It has NOTHING to do with the screen calubration or what manufacturing date, time or any other factors


Explain to me why this was not the case with every single iPad generation before?
They all worked flawlessly with a new screen and a new „uncalibrated“ chip on it.
Same with the iPhone 12 Camera Module and the iPhone XS Batteries as well the Screens on the iPhone 11 upwards.
All of them contain a serialization that knocks out the part as soon as the iPhone realized that the part has been replaced.

You know what the funniest thing about this whole ordeal is though?
The issue does not appear UNTIL THE FUCKING DEVICE HAS AN INTERNET CONNECTION.

If you keep the device without internet after replacing, it works fine, a replaced camera module also works fine, a replaced screen works fine, a swapped battery works fine.
But as soon as the device has an active Internet connection, error messages appear, and things stop working lol.

Your logic is flawed and you dont have any practical experience actually dealing with the issue


Its funny how these rules change with Generations. Every iPhone so far up to the iPhone 12 worked flawlessly with a replaced Camera Module, and now all of a sudden they need calibration to be functional at all?

Every single iPad so far did NOT need any calibration after replacing the Whole Screen with a new chip in it, untouched.

And now all of a sudden they also need calibration?

Thats not how that works. If they did from the very beginning of introducing iPads with Apple Pencil Support then OK, but no, no iPad screen ever needed calibration, every single part worked, original, not original, third party parts. Every part worked flawlessly and without issues, why do these screens all of a sudden require calibration to work? 
Calibrations that only Apple can do, and does not allow anybody else to even get their hands on the software that is used?

Your logic is quite funny, and would maybe be correct in this case if it was like that with older generations.
That is not the case so i rest mine


I wonder why this was no issue with every single generation of iPads before this one. They are based off the same technology and the same manufacturing partners. And yet we never had any issues with uncalibrated screens lol


Oh i definitely have. Its just not a present Issue in Germany


Those are the only two scenarios when the right thing to do is disable those features, you really do not want a device where someone can replace the biometric sensors and nothing breaks.


I don't owe you any proof, many-hardware-labs sir. I provided a name and if you're interested enough to write this salty answer I believe you're in capacity to read my comment again, with attention this time. But I'm worried about it being too difficult to understand indeed so take as much time as you need.


what do you dislike about your android ~~in~~I’m considering jumping to android


Redditors that have never actually worked in corporate think that people in corporations just sit around being evil all day long.


unless i missed something, the microcontroller swap was after the screen swap, they didn't test the swapped microcontroller with that original screen


But when the microcontroller, that supposedly stores these magical calibrations, is moved to a different screen, it still works fine. It's only a problem when the serial number of the microcontroller doesn't match what the phone is expecting.


the mental gymnastics... you realize the replacement screen *that was fully functional* also had one of those right? so both would be giving a perfectly calibrated output

just admit you don't understand what you're talking about and move on


Think about that carefully.

If the two screens had **different** calibration data, then attributing the calibration data of the original screen (by swapping the chip) to the new screen *would make it not work*. We have the opposite here.

If the two screens had **the same** calibration, then swapping the chip wouldn't be necessary because they'd have the same data. Again, we have the opposite here.


For the new screen? Lol. So the argument is, it's a new screen so it needs new calibration. Why would the calibrations on the old chip work then? Does it hold the calibration of every possible screen? And if so, that would mean every chip does, why doesn't the new chip? This is apple screwing over third party repair shops, plain and simple.


I think you don't understand what's being said. If it were a calibration issue then swapping the chips wouldn't work. See iPad breaks screen A. Unofficial store replaces it with screen B and it doesn't work properly. Then store gets screen A's chip and puts it in screen B. Now even if the chip held some calibration info, it would be specific to screen A so it shouldn't magically work in screen B.


The fact that the chip detects whether or not it's connected to the original logic board, fails to work properly if it's not, and works properly if it is, *even with an entirely new screen*, shows without any doubt that this is not a "calibration" issue.

Calibration issues result from different properties between parts, simply telling the logic board, "this is the original part" cannot fix a calibration issue.


That's not what calibration is or means. That's serialization aka hardware lock, similar to the touch id fiasco. Or simply put, the way crapple works.

You'd have to go out of your way to implement the mechanism in this way. There is 0 technical reason for this to exist in this way.


And that’s exactly what it is. In Apple Stores and repair centers when they replace screens they have a machine that calibrates the screen to the device. Third parties don’t have this calibration device. But it’s Reddit so Apple bad.


It was a joke on Apple saying this against third party repair but being sued for that exact thing. [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-settled-lawsuit-womans-nudes-leaked-iphone-repair-workers-2021-6)


It's just as likely to be done by an apple employee though.


[deleted]


And you don't think an employee working at a apple repair centre can't do the same?


Yes, I'm well aware they were being sarcastic!


It’s delicious.


I'm just weirded out by the way it acts, those types of artifacts are the exact thing that was present on early EMR screens, if I wanted to block apple pencil on swapped screens I'd just block the functionality outright


Except that the calibration would travel with the chip - OTP memory is a thing, as is flash memory to store calibrations.  I suspect most of the posters here have no idea what they are talking about.


I’ve always assumed that Apples end goal is a series of seamless magic crystals. A singular slab with no ports, no openings, entirely built in house. 

It’s enticing, but deeply anti consumer _if_ classic consumer patterns and trends stay as they are. If in-house recycling can become the standard, it mitigates some of the concerns.


No shit


Hostile architecture


Yeah it doesn't really make sense beyond them being serialised and acting out on purpose


>I can stop all I want to, I can do the best and most ethical alternatives around. But that won’t change that EVERYONE ELSE has to also do the same thing.

[If enough people...](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/15cxwaa/apple_pencils_cant_draw_straight_on_thirdparty/jtzsiup/)

It's not everyone. Or do you posit that no business has ever reverted unpopular policy changes due to consumer trends? Do you really think Apple could sell half as many products as they do now without asking themselves where they went wrong?

The stalwart defense of you and your ilk absolutely ensures that Apple continues those practices. Christ, just saying, "this thing they are doing is bad" brings you guys out of the woodwork. It absolutely ensures that the hivemind doesn't need to question their fanboyism. If all you guys just said, "Yeah I agree they shouldn't do that" it could make a difference *even if you personally continued using their products*. It would allow genuine discussion instead of just people trying to talk over these attempts to shut down criticism. It's hilarious that you call out "fanboy wars" when not only are you acting like a fanboy, I can't even imagine what fanboys are anti-apple. There are dozens of competitors, and cultivating fanboys is basically Apple's entire business model.

>I’m no better than the average consumer and the average consumer craves convience [sic] and savings.

Cool, you must stay away from Apple already then.


So apple has “accidentally” lobbied against right to repair?

And has “accidentally” make it so people can’t repair devices on their own, even with Apple OEM parts?

And has “accidentally “ keeps happening year after year, device model after device model.

I have a bridge to sell you. You interested?


Not paying apple tho statisfying enough. But to get me to buy a new one kill the processing power and claim it just cant keep up. Also the iPhone was designed with DARPA miney it’s essentially owned by the United States Government and Tax Payers.


the stupidity is making arguments about child slavery and still using the technology. then making justifications like “well, i didn’t pay for it”

I bet someone you care for has an iphone, they must supports child slave labor! see how stupid that fucking sounds?


Thai shrimp slavery imagine the hell of that years in a bit the smell. I actually don’t eat shrimp. When it comes to clothes the us does not allow certain cotton from regions of China cuz of slavery. But to be honest I haven’t bought new clothes in along time. But I only talk about it when others bring it up first!


why would you buy two to swap screens?


Did you know that two of something as complex as a screen aren’t necessarily exactly the same? Why do you think calibration exists as a concept?


I’m not going by the video from another source I’m going by the article that was posted. Maybe they should post an article that aligns more with the source video because the article clearly differentiates between genuine apple screens and 3rd party screens. 

In the article posted here is a direct quote 


“iCorrect's attempts to draw a straight line on an iPad Pro with a third-party replacement screen led them to look at the screen's embedded chips for parts-pairing problems.”

Also in the same article 

“Reports from repair shops and customers suggest that Apple Pencils no longer work properly on non-genuine Apple screens, as they draw squiggly lines on a diagonal instead of straight.”

I understand the source video may make different claims than the article but that’s not what I’m commenting on.


They spent hundreds of millions fighting anti repair rights in every state. They knew if one state required it, it would be hard to stop it in others. Hard to fight when politicians are allowed to become rich while in office, the average one after one term has a few million dollars of network growth off of their 180k salary.


Tim Apple is an easy guy to be friends with.

But seriously, I understand there can be important discussion from various industry leaders, but why isn't it a bigger stink that CEOs frequently get direct sit downs with our Presidents? Even with their hooks in the economy, it doesn't seem necessary, yet almost requires any relationship to be transactional... leading to inevitable concessions of the public, as they're the side that can actually concede anything. A major corporation literally can't, it's asking for the death of the company to offer *less*, next quarter needs its profit. 

Only the government can offer less at this table, and that's kinda fucked. We need a separation somehow.


Yeah its called Lobbying and theyre good at it


[deleted]


Because mega corporations are a monopoly/oligopoly threat.  Even if there are a few companies competing, competition between a group you can count on one hand is far and away lopsided against the consumer with an oligopoly like that.  
Big Tech has significant economies of scale and network effects, so it will tend to concentrate over time if left to its own devices.


My thoughts exactly. There's probably a service app for calibrating the screen but knowing apple there's no chance for 3rd party to be able to launch it.


> They would do what they did with Touch ID—literally prevent the hardware from functioning with the device.

That's a security feature though. Otherwise you could defeat Touch ID by replacing parts.


> They would do what they did with Touch ID

Thats ignoring what they do with everything else. Screen replacements result in no True Tone, camera replacements result in buggy camera app. Afaik only replacement that results in a hard lock out from ALL functionality is Touch ID. 

Apple has an extensive anti repair history, making third party repair look shoddy fits their past and current behavior perfectly well, and it supports their political aims.


Hey, let’s not be sensible here. Apple are clearly the devil and have just made it not work quite right just to spite you. It’s genuinely astonishing how many people hate apple so much that you could make up and mad shit and they would 100% believe it even if it makes 0 sense.


No. It would make perfect sense for transportation the control chip with the calibration for that screen to fix the issue.


What makes you think the chip just says “here’s an I’d number” and doesn’t do something like manage the tolerances to give a general response to position on the screen etc?  

Extreme example: screen 1 is 2mm thick and screen 2 is 1mm thick. Chip 1 manages it so the response is the stylus is 0mm from the sensor by taking 1mm off, chip 2 does the same but has to take 2mm off. Not transferring the chip will always make a screen 1 and chip 2 combo 1mm out.


from what I read, it seems that it works with the chip from the old broken screen, not with the new chip of the replacement


I hate apple a lot but I don't see a reason that the pencil would still work but not draw straight unless it's some sort of calibration issue. I know they have some fancy sensors and I wouldn't be surprised to know they need calibration. But how would it make sense to add a verification chip that still lets it work but just makes it suck? Surely you would just make it stop working?


My screen randomly brightens the color saturation sometimes and the only way to fix it is to restart the iphone. I have not figured out any cause or steps to reproduce. It just happens sometimes, for the past few years, on multiple devices.


> causing random glitches in the user experience is anathema to them.

That's some fanboy/shill nonsense because fucking with people who didn't go to them to be sold a new device and instead got a third party to repair is has be Apples MO for at least a decade now.


A lot of these people are talking out of there ass.  Apple is crazy about calibration methods, they have “Apple Certified” repair centers that they say they hold as legitamate as an Apple Store and with that comes a whole suite of proprietary diagnostics and repair hardware from Apple over an Ethernet wire (it is a live service). Every time anything hardware at all was done we had a whole calibration procedure we had to go to before releasing back the device - most important and drawn out was screen calibration.


Well... [They do.](https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair)


This might sound crazy, so bear with me. Maybe they are calling bullshit on their comment and asking them to back it up.

You can call out a comment for being false and spreading misinformation without defending the company. The comment is calling out.


Just out of curiosity &mdash; how, on a technical level, did you and other repair shops preclude the possibility that calibration is not also involved? Is there any calibration data that is different per device and stored on the logic board, or none at all? What happens when you change the serial code back to the authorized screen?


I am none of those things and it's pretty much smelling like that from where I'm sitting too. But that's only cause I'm somewhat decent at recognising patterns of behaviour.

Disabling face id makes sense though from a security standpoint imo. To prevent someone from using custom hardware to feed biometrics from a computer rather than a camera to the phone. Or at least makes it harder to do so.


I don't disagree with what you're saying, but calling the company "crapple" while trying to criticize them for legitimate reasons ensures that you also have no credibility, regardless of the argument you're making.


I use the words it's certainly possible because there I don't believe there's enough information to conclusively conclude one way or another and I don't like to attribute stuff to malice by default. I have enough reasons to dislike Apple already, I don't need to go hunting for another. 

I also don't have any belief that Apple has the interests of right to repair at heart and I even stated that there should be options, if it is truly calibration data that is being stored, for the end user to update that calibration data. All I'm doing is acknowledging that its possible, based off my EE experience, that there's a valid reason for the displays to show jitter like it does in the video while also saying that Apple should be doing better.


Disabling FaceID and TouchID when the parts are replaced is the right thing to do, otherwise it opens you to man in the middle attacks.


I understood it the other way around, but yes if you're interpretation is correct, then it would be backwards.


no cause an apple employee would actually know about the wildly anti consumer bullshit that goes on at apple


You mean you found the person who understands hardware.  Assuming this is malicious without understanding what's really going on is asinine.


Well Deere & Company are the most anti repair company state side.


Then just refuse to decrypt the contents of the memory and force a factory reset or something. Don't break shit physically.


Tape and a photo bypassed the features you're toting. Cmon, don't be a homer.


you're on r/gadgets buddy.  we don't use logic and reasoning here.


All that doing this does is prove you do not own the hardware you bought.


Probably hard to find proof because Louis Rossmann put out a video basically confirming it’s effectively a calibration issue (pairing because the calibration is probably stored server side and downloaded for that chip’s ID rather than on the chip itself), but the real issue is the lack of ability to calibrate and the need to swap the chip. But this sub is so up in arms about it being “DRM” or something… it does the whole right to repair movement a disservice. 

It doesn’t work: “Apple must have DRM!” Yeah ok.

Down vote me as much as you like. It’s like salty tears falling from the sky. It’s not a DRM. So you can quit your whining about it. At least I know you’ve read this now so you can see how wrong you were. And good luck finding that proof that it is what it’s not. 

Yes it is anti repair. No it’s not DRM or serialisation.


I have a Pixel 5a and for me, it has been death by a thousand cuts. A bunch of small, quality of life issues adding up over time. The apps just aren't as polished on Android as they are on iOS, even when it comes down to the same app. Lots of little hiccups like the app hanging or constantly refreshing my feed and losing my spot. Keyboard accuracy, or lack thereof has been a HUGE issue for me. Also, the walled walled garden situation. I have a Google phone and a Samsung watch so I'm locked out of some features of the watch like EKG without sideloading a hacked app and so on and the watch itself falls short. I literally have to hold it right up to my mouth for it to pick up my "Hey Google" and even then, sometimes my phone takes over. I've also had several instances where I answer the phone in the car using Android Auto and the watch takes over the call. Never had ANY of these issues with Apple products.


Not him but have used Android extensively and switched to IPhone about 3 years ago myself as the XR was the most reasonably price phone in the market for features/battery life at the time.

Android really really depends on the Phone you buy and what apps you use. 

One of my primary reasons for moving was battery life when using third party apps, speaking of third party apps a lot of them aren’t “streamlined” or as good as they could be in general due to there being many different hardware variations on Android. 

Snapchat was a huge offender for both of these issues on Android.

Since moving I can say for sure FaceID blows every other biometric lock that is available on android out the water.


Switched from apple to android then went back to apple 

Main reason: apple devices support are way longer.


So you want Apple to allow user and third party repairs AND provide the tools that they R&Ded? If third parties want to do repairs why shouldn’t they develop the tools?


You said so, so it must be true.. right?


It pairs the serial numbers, it doesn't calibrate. Not the same thing at all. Another way of saying it: it bypasses a hardware lock. 

If your car brakes fail, would you want to have to go to the dealer only to get it repaired or "calibrated" even if you or say a 3rd party shop could do it?


Apple must have really shit engineers then, I've replaced touchscreens in all kinds of phones and laptops and desktops and the only ones that required calibration are super ancient displays from some old cash registers.  And with those, the calibration was "run this free utility then tap on the screen three times".


Joke or not, I'm just saying that it can happen everywhere.  
Even with apple having a lot of procedures and try to vet out employees who might do it, and even if you do 100 background checks and threaten employees with jail time, there will always be that one extra idiot who will pull something off like that. Either in a big company like apple or a small independent local repair shop.  
Those people can't be vetted.  
I also expect that it will most likely less happen in terms of scale, at a big company than a smaller one. But it will happen regardless.


On the flip side at CompUSA back in the day we had 3 pedophiles get busted in 3 years for bringing their computers in full of child porn.  So while snooping is fucked up at least in those three cases it had a net positive result.


I didn't say otherwise.


My bad, long post made it look like you took it seriously. I'll delete my account.


If you swap an iphone 14 screen with another iphone 14, it disables truetone and auto-brightness, and shows a warning on the screen about "genuine parts." Apple picked those things out and selectively made them happen.

Do the same with a battery, and battery statistics and health are disabled and you get a "genuine parts" warning again.

If you swap out the front facing camera, it doesn't work at all.

If you swap out the back camera, you get a genuine parts warning.

If you swap the logic board, all of those things happen.

In each case, Apple decided what they should force to go wrong. Removal of line-correction algorithms isn't significantly different from those.


Wouldn't a new screen require a new calibration then? How does taking the old calibration and pairing it with a new screen fixing it make any sense.


That's not how calibration works dude.

Not even a little bit. It's extremely apparent that you have no idea what you're talking about. Basic reasoning proves it isn't calibration.


I choose Apple products because they’re known to last years longer than competitors support wise. I don’t care how many people are just fine with security updates, most people would rather not feel like they have outdated tech after only 3 years of updates with Android phones, and with Windows, MacOS beats it over time because of the “walled garden”. I like the connivence and that’s why I use their products, I’m highly against the Android fragmentation issue especially and I swore I’ll never get an android phone until it’s fixed.

Since that’s out of the way, I’m not a fanboy, I’m just lazy with tech. Despite being knowledgeable, I hate tinkering. Apple products are the equivalent of oatmeal, nothing rocks the boat too much, nothings all too exciting, I can pick up the device and it’ll be the same experience almost every time. That’s what I wish other companies would do rather than push for these devices to e-waste after a couple of years. The resell market on Apple products is great for that reason, I can buy a 3 year old device and not feel like it’s outdated because I have the same major software features as everyone else for years. When they do rock the boat, the internet blows up for weeks or months until it’s just normal.

I’m not a fan of them, personally I’m close to just ditching smartphones and condensing my tech all together, but they put way more effort into the user experience compared to most companies. THAT’S why they’re popular, that’s why I have them. That’s why people aren’t just going to ditch their products, and the biggest thing here is, you forget my biggest point here.

There’s more hate for Apple because they’re a recognizable brand, but there’s way worse shit going on that just makes them one of the “evil” corporations. Sticking with tech, since you’re obviously enough of a geek to keep quoting me and even using a [sic], I want you to look into the printer industry, I want you to look into how integral the internet is now and how the system in place for providers now give little room for competition in the US. Your initial comment was making your frustration wayy bigger than it has to be when there’s WORSE companies out here that we’re ignoring

And speaking of ignoring, despite you quoting me, you seemed to dive deep back into Apple rather than addressing my point. I’m not even trying to defend them, but you’re putting me in the situation where I basically have to so I can prove the point.


I didn’t claim it was an accident either.. I explained there are technical reasons and we also have zero proof..


Not enough citizens understand DARPA…. 

We paid for this shit. Our tax money funded private fucking companies. They don’t NEED to profit off us, they literally ONLY have th tech bc of us.


Imagine shilling for Apple


It’s the size and wealth of apple doesn’t need slave labor to build their products but they do. That’s my point.


To make one functioning device out of two broken ones

It's a standard repair procedure applied on pretty much anything you can buy.


Let's say that me and my gf both buy the same model of iPad cos we both want one. A few years later, she cracks her screen and I have got mine water damaged. If the screen still works on mine, it would make sense to give her the good screen and have 1 fully functioning iPad again, instead of both having to go to a repair centre. I could then buy myself a new one, probably for the same price or lower than what it would have cost to repair both at the "Genius" bar.

“Come on now you wouldn’t your job creators to stop creating jobs. Without jobs, people won’t be able to afford our products, our sales slump, investors lose confidence, and this whole house of cards comes crashing down. You don’t won’t really want that on your watch, do you?”

Yeah they’ve pretty much got us boxed in.


We can't even get separation of church and state which we are legally supposed to have. Separating corpos and state is too much to ask. (But luckily they now sell a pill to make you feel better about it.)


Lightning is actually the same speed as micro usb - USB 2.0 480mbps. Ever tried transferring stuff between iphone and something else? Its slow as hell


They've had years to switch over to USB C on iPhones, the devices they sell most of. They still haven't. Why are you defending them? Lightning bolt may have been justified back then. It isn't now and it hasn't been for years.


Is lightning in iPhone faster? It still uses USB 2.0 speeds and is limited to 480 Mb/s just like Micro USB.


[deleted]


They absolutely did not help develop the USB C in good faith though. They help (solely with money) to make the "thunderbolt" and then wanted to be the exclusive maker of it. Once that was clearly not happening They made the Lightning instead


Then then should have abandoned the lightning "standard" as soon as USB-C came out, and offered free lightning-to-USB-C adapters to everybody. 

Samsung phones came with a bunch of micro-USB adapters for a bit, for free.

And it's not like the protocols are incompatible either, lightning cables connect to PCs through USB anyway, and losing fast charging when using an adapter isn't much of a loss


There is a Calibration App from Apple, but it doesnt calibrate shit except for the serial number of the screen.
The device does no calibration in the process


Yes. I didn’t say otherwise.

In fact, it even further supports that this is a calibration issue, as there is no “security” reason to prevent this type of repair.


This argument is bullshit. The fingerprint sensor is just a sensor. It doesn't make the "yes/no" decisions. Sure, you could replace the sensor with a device that would let you "scan" arbitrary fingerprints, but the only way to know what fingerprint to send would be to scan the person's fingerprint. Which if you have, you don't need a hypothetical "malicious scanner." The only other thing you could do with it was a hypothetical brute force attack, except for a few things:

A) even if you could do this, it would take literally forever. There is much more entropy in your fingerprint than your pin or password.

B) Fingerprints are disabled on device boot, and after multiple failed scans.

&#x200B;

The fingerprint sensor is attached to the screen, which is the most common repair. By breaking functionality on repair, Apple can say "See? Should have let us repair it.. Oh wait, it's too old, we don't repair those any more. Should have bought a new phone."

&#x200B;

If the "security" argument made -any- sense from an actual engineering standpoint, than you'd see the same behavior in at least some of the any other manufacturers of fingerprint phones, or laptop fingerprint sensors. But literally NO other manufacturer does this, because it's nonsense.


Apple does have an anti-repair history, but you’re talking about situations where a repair, combined with a lack of effort on their part to ensure repairs *don’t* cause issues like this. That’s much different than them *deliberately sabotaging* repairs.


You didnt read the article.


Thats not whats happening. When they take the chip from old display, put it into new display and put all that in the old ipad screen works. 

Display A Chip A iPad A = working

Display A Chip A iPad B = not working

Display A Chip B iPad B = working

If chip had calibration data for Display A in it dAcAiB shouldve worked.


oh. I just realized they said that it's the chip from the old broken screen that works, not from the new one...


> What makes you think the chip just says “here’s an I’d number” and doesn’t do something like manage the tolerances to give a general response to position on the screen etc? 


Display A Chip A iPad A = working

Display A Chip A iPad B = not working

Display A Chip B iPad B = working

If chip had calibration data for Display A in it dAcAiB shouldve worked.

If chip had calibration data for Display A in it then chip B shouldve NOT work with display A


Other way around, actually. The chip is on the screen itself, not the iPad. You’d have to transfer the old screen’s calibration to the new screen for it to work properly.


> how would it make sense to add a verification chip that still lets it work but just makes it suck? 

it makes money not sense


Yeah, I've seen that link posted a bunch of times, unfortunately never by anyone who has had to use it though. 

[Try ordering parts for an iPad.](https://selfservicerepair.com/en-US/order)


From another comment in this topic (not my own):

"No that is not the case. Its not a calibration that really happens here because the screens and the hardware are identical. Its the iPad realizing a different serial number and suddenly not working the way it was intended anymore. We have been seeing this from Apple since the iPhone 5S in all kinds of parts, and they are getting smarter and smarter about messing up devices that have been repaired by parties other than Apple. Apple is the most anti-repair company ever and this is just another case of them doing shit like this"


> I'm somewhat decent at recognising patterns of behaviour.

Resume gold right there!


Must be nice, the only pattern that I am decent at recognizing is houndstooth


Are you... on the toilet


The user will get the impression the third party repair store uses inferior parts or cannot properly do part replacement like Apple directly.

Meanwhile from a political / PR perspective there is ambiguity around whether Apple is truly disadvantaging third party repair as this thread shows.

Apple has a pattern of using this approach of removing or worsening features when parts are replaced by third parties. There are plenty of YouTube videos demonstrating this. 

The fact that Android phone repairs do not run into the same issues on identical parts repair should demonstrate that this is an intentionally engineered strategy.


Because then there'd be no ambiguity.


Because then it would be obvious and couldn't be excused by slandering a third party repair shop and insinuating they use cheap knockoff parts.


That would hold weight, except they have many deceptive practices. Like their original OS, stealing cpu tech from UW Madison, etc etc, antenna gate, battery gate....all things that they had to pay out for. But yes they aren't crappy at all. /s


There is literally years of data to support my point, but you continue to do...whatever it is you are.


For what it's worth, I'm glad you shared your lucid and humble opinion. Don't let the downvotes get you down! The majority of these people are idiots.


Face-ID snd Touch-ID features are disabled by default as soon as the device reboots and until it is unlocked by a code the first time.

That already eliminates ANY kind of hardware tempering to unlock a device illegally.
Locking the components to the device permanently and disallowing replacements is an anti repair tactic. Doing this with Touch and Face-ID was just the first step in this. Afterwards they started doing this with the Taptic Engine from iPhone 7 upwards, with the Batteries from iPhone XS upwards as well as with the Display Modules from iPhone 11 upwards and now with the Camera Modules from iPhone 12 upwards. What excuse do you have for that?


You sweet summer child. When tape or a photo can bypass either of those, your argument is DOA.


This is Apple propaganda and doesn't make sense in any real world scenario.


im entirely too lazy to explain to you why it is malicious but if you actually wanna know, watch rossmann repair group on youtube. the guy has been repairing apple products for over a decade and frequently makes videos on apples blatant bullshittery


[deleted]


That is exactly what happens, the sensors are paired with the Secure Enclave if they are switched out the new ones are no longer valid for authentication that’s 100% the right way to deal with this specific scenario given the sensitivity of the parts that were replaced.

Now it’s perfectly fine to hold the position that the additional level of assurance and privacy that is provided by this isn’t sufficient to justify the loss of ability to use a 3rd party repair service for these parts, and in that case the solution is simple there are plenty of devices out there that do not enforce the same level of security on critical parts.


No they didn't. Why spread lies ?


Photos definitely do not fool Face ID. One of its principle features is that it uses depth cues. Numerous attempts were made to break it very early on and the only one that worked required complex 3D printing of actual face shapes.

Android is a very different story, along with Windows Hello (EDIT: A reply points out I may be wrong about Hello, which seems to use an additional IR camera) which usually use cheesy crap optical recognition via cheap 2D off-the-shelf camera hardware that's trivial to fool. Apple's ever-declining software quality also bites these days; I see reports of iPhone 12 at launch being fooled by simple photos, which is a hell of a fuckup but this is Tim Cook's Apple so that just comes with the janky, overpriced territory now, sadly.

Touch ID is more easily fooled. Even by design, it recognises fewer unique patterns (Apple quote around 50,000 unique vs millions for Face ID), but despite that, the conditions required to successfully lift a fingerprint onto tape and use it to unlock a device require a *very* clean print source, *of that device owner's fingerprint*.

The real-world exploit conditions for that are far more challenging to make actually work than you see in movies, because movies are bullshit.

It's easier just to chop off a finger - which, unfortunately, *has* happened in at least one grisly instance I saw in the news. ISTR that was for unlocking a car, though, as I imagine thieves probably won't find it worth the effort to do that just to steal a phone.


link me a source


>I have a Google phone and a Samsung watch so I'm locked out of some features of the watch like EKG without sideloading a hacked app and so on and the watch itself falls short. I literally have to hold it right up to my mouth for it to pick up my "Hey Google" and even then, sometimes my phone takes over.

You know you can buy from the same brand even if that brand isn't apple, right? Integration would be even worse if you had an iphone and a non-apple smartwatch


I mean, the 5a costs like half of what an iPhone costs as well, and Samsung has a notoriously insular ecosystem.


The fingerprint scanner in my Pixel 2 was significantly better than FaceID (far better than any Apple fingerprint scanner I’ve dealt with) but since everyone has dropped those, it doesn’t really matter at this point. One of the things I still miss from my Pixel. I think I’m going to have a fight on my hands to ever get my husband to ditch his Pixel 3a because of that.


That’s a huge part of why I swapped to Apple even though I’ve hated then for decades. Having a phone stop getting updates just a few months after paying it off (or a year if you buy it right at launch) is ridiculous. And that’s from Google themselves!


How exactly would third parties develop software that generates secure digital signatures from Apple servers? Because that's the "tool" required.

Third parties have in the past developed tools to get around Apple's nonsense.  For example, the proprietary pentalobe screw heads.  So Apple stepped up to requiring software tools that only work with their authorization.

Apple needs to stop going out of their way to make repair harder.  They're only doing it to make money.  Everything they say to justify it is just marketing bullshit.  If they don't stop requiring software tools, then yes they need to make them available.

You can go to a third party store like AutoZone and buy all the parts and tools you need to fix your car.  Many of those are not from the OEM.  Some of them are actually identical to OEM parts because they're made in the same factory. Yet there's no way to do that same exact thing with your phone. Apple even forces their suppliers to not sell certain components to anyone except Apple.


What I was trying to get across is, that Apple is hypocrite when it comes to 3rd party repair. They had to settle a lawsuit because one of their techs got caught spying on their customers but they continue to badmouth 3rd party repair shops.

Where's my pitchfork?!

And different things are disabled depending on the iOS version


Nah, I'd say this is significantly more obscure then all of the above


It’s not a new screen. It’s a swapped in screen. Swap in the chip that holds the calibration for the properties of that screen and yeah it will work. 

Rossmann did a video just recently on this very topic now. 

Probably leave a lot of people on this sub very red faced because a serious amount of back tracking has to be done by people declaring it’s serialisation. It was so obviously a calibration issue but there’s so much hate and bike spewed here, and rightly so in some cases given the history of repairability of Apple devices… but that’s no excuse to just make shit up


> I like the connivence

Just lead with that. Most people don't appreciate the conniving of others.


>I’m not even trying to defend them

Saying "they're all bad," is a defense. You're basically saying, "you guys have no right to say bad things about apple because every company is bad." You're attempting to shut down criticism.

The old, "you think that's bad, well this is way worse so talk about that instead" is now and has always been a terrible argument.


Technical reasons that didn’t exist before? On every model? Every new year? What technical difficulties explain the lobbyists? Cmon man. These are business decisions not technical ones.

Youl could also break yours as well and then have two broken ones with both now being beyond repair. 

I’m really not advocating either way, but I’d pay for an authorized service to have some type of warrantied repair. I say this as someone technology inclined who has very much repaired hardware in the past. 

I know they have become common place and people treat them as such, but these are complicated pieces of machinery/technology that do so much. Your average owner who wants to save a few bucks on a repair doesn’t even know how to back up their data.

Yeah, the Touch ID sounds like a specific security design choice. Everything else sounds like issues with highly sensitive calibration where they didn’t design for simple replacement.


Thats a very particular interpretation of events on your side. If you want some information on why you might be wrong you can watch some videos of Louis Rossmann on the topic, starting with these.

I did and nothing in there suggests that apple have intentionally created the bug on purpose. I mean, it was an in depth and well researched article though so…


Unless the calibration information is stored within system memory... then it all starts making sense again.


Ah, thank you. I wasn't quite following the situation.

Yeah, that's not calibration.


I mean all of this could make perfect sense depending on what's going on in the back end.


A very long time ago, when I was 18 or 19, I had under my hobbies and interests "musically inept".

Clearly I'm improving.


Wow that shits hypnotically hideous. Kinda looks a bit like a Magic Eye picture too. If I ever see one myself out in the wild I'll be sure to squint and stare intently at that persons midsection.


Who isn't?


As I said, I don't disagree. I don't own any Apple devices because I disagree with many of their business practices, some of which you described. All I'm saying is that name calling while trying to make a legitimate argument lessens your credibility as well, which was ironic since you were saying how someone didn't have credibility because of their choice of words.


That isn’t enough, I want to know for sure that the device hasn’t been tampered with, this level of tamper protection should not only be expected but should be required especially from any device which has a digital wallet.


Tape and photos cannot bypass modern biometric sensors.


What Apple propaganda I can easily demonstrate how they attacks work on other devices. If your position is that this specific threat isn’t part of your threat model that’s perfectly fine buy another device. If for one am very happy to know that if I am separated from my device replacing the hardware with a modified one will require the ability to defeat hardware locks which is quite difficult to do especially in the field.


Its funny that you say that, without actually knowing about the actual SecureEnclave Integration being present inside these IC‘s


100% agreed. As a security engineer it's infuriating to see idiots on Reddit complaining about shit they don't understand. I have worked with the engineers that worked on this and I can guarantee that they have a better understanding of security the fuckwits complaining on Reddit.


It's almost like you can look it up, but sure.


You are right about everything about everything, save for the bit about Windows Hello. That relies on similar technology as Face ID (or other 3D face unlock solutions)


Fingerprints aren’t nearly as unique as people think and the 1:50,000 for fast biometric sensors is actually relatively good most biometric sensors are much lower than that. It’s still astronomically unlikely that a false entry would be allowed especially with the lockout.

TouchID also employ 3D matching a tape does not fool it as much as it does cheaper sensors, it also does some signs of life measurement and the material needs to have a similar conductivity to human skin.

The level of fantasy people live in here is absurd.

I work in this field on the offensive side, including a 4 year stint at Cellebrite as researcher, whilst Apple does a lot of shady things the only mobile device that it would ever have on my person would be an iPhone and today in lockdown mode.


Chopping of a finger seems high risk charges vs reward for getting 10-25% of a cars value on the black market. But then again I’m not a psychopath who doesn’t have an issue bringing lopping off a digit to the table for a stealing a vehicle


Look it up, it's been done.


Isn't this the exact same facial recognition that was allowing Asian people to unlock each other's phones despite not looking alike?


What?! I had no idea! /s


Only when your hands were dry though. I didn’t mean just for speed or accuracy. It blows them all out the water for convenience and privacy on Lock Screen notifications.

It’s actually a major reason I haven’t considered going back to Android. I never want to deal with a finger print sensor again. Any implementation of facial scanning for Android has been insecure and fooled by 2d photos and has been second class at best.


Do you have a link that apple are claiming that 3rd party repair shops will steal and spy on customers?  
While apple said that 3rd party repair might use unauthorized parts, stolen parts, fake parts, mishandle the repair etc, I hadn't seen that apple claimed they will take your data from your phone.  
  
Besides, apple didn't really pay. Their 3rd party repair company (yes, apple themselves are using 3rd party company to repair their phones) was the one who payed the money and their insurance company.  
Apple just wanted their name out of the lawsuit claiming it was not apple's fault.  
  
I'm not shilling for apple, but I'm not supporting information without a base just because you hate a company.


I'm scared, ok?


I think so.


More obscure for you, perhaps.

We can show logically that this is entirely a serialization issue with no "calibration" aspect, so I'm not sure why it matters.


See, this is why I don’t like people that quote on Reddit. You pick out what you SPECIFICALLY want to respond with and ignore the rest.

I’m going to say everything one more time as clear and simple as possible.

There’s WORSE companies out there, I’m not saying they’re all bad, I’m not undermining your damn opinion. I’m saying that there’s worse companies out there, that just targeting Apple won’t solve anything because it’s capitalism as a whole doing this. All this effort is being put into targeting Apple because they’re a more known brand, but the main companies behind all this get away with what they’re doing without any acknowledgment. What we need to be doing is focusing on putting politicians in place that can bring these companies down. The average person isn’t going to toss savings and convince to the side to vote with their wallets, I have one Walmart next to me because they out performed the competition in my area, a common occurrence, it’s a long drive to any alternatives so this major corporation that stripped away the local businesses ends up getting my money and nearly everyone else’s. We’re so damn focused on fan wars and shit that instead of looking deeper into things, we got our fingers in our asses fighting each other.

By avoiding my points, by cherry picking your argument, you literally proved my point. I mentioned voting these companies down a peg, obviously don’t like capitalism, but instead of just thinking for a second you go straight into “DURR YOU GUYS ARE A HIVEMIND”

“You guys”? I don’t like any of these fucking corps, I just tolerate some.


Still waiting for actual evidence..


I agree! I’ve worked ina kitchen at 16. I mean paying servers below minimum wage is a form of leverage and performance. Now slap the ability to tip say buying gum it’s now expected companies make more money pay less and let me the consumer literally pay the tab. My point is. Apple doesn’t need a new dollar the way their doing business will it change not likely. But look how the south of the USA and their ideology on slavery looks today. Not good.


That repair procedure is impossible with iphones though.

Preventing official parts to be swapped is so rare that it's the only device I can think off which does this.


You’d prefer to pay for a warrantied repair.  Others would not.  The problem is that Apple has historically taken the option away intentionally.  I’m not sure if you’re being intentionally obtuse or what.


Anyone else notice how the conversation point very quickly moved away from "Apple uses special hardware to calibrate their replacement screens on phones & ipads" to.. ..whatever this is?


Sorry, you didnt watch the video attached then. Although article couldve done a better job at summarizing the video. 

Whats happening is : 

Display A Chip A iPad A = working

Display A Chip A iPad B = not working

Display A Chip B iPad B = working

If chip A had calibration data for Display A in it dAcAiB shouldve worked.

If chip B had calibration data for Display B in it then chip B shouldve NOT work with display A.


It's certainly possible: it's literally possible

Me making fun of a company for having shitty practices is not on the level of blatantly ignoring what's literally possible. But ok.


You literally cannot replace the parts in question without shutting down the device, and as soon as you turn it back on, face/touch ID are disabled until you use a PIN. In what way is that less secure than totally disabling face/touch ID when you replace hardware? Either way, if you know the PIN you can get into the system.


[deleted]


A lifted finger print defeated touch id. A photo defeated face id. You can look it up for yourself. My goodness.


Why would a thief replace your screen or whatever?  If they wanted your data badly enough to do some sort of complex hardware swap attack, they could just put a gun against your head and demand you unlock the phone. Much easier, no complex tech knowledge needed.

[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/538/)


That's because it's simply not true.

You can't fake TouchID with tape and FaceID with a poster.


I did, it hasn't.

Post the independently peer-reviewed and proven citation, or go away, troll.


Citation needed.


The FaceID is definitely quite secure. It’s actually what’s a little annoying about it comparison to putting my finger on the scanner on the back as I lifted the phone-the slightest weirdness like me glancing off a bit keeps it from unlocking. Day to day, it’s annoying, but it’s nice to know all I have to do is pull a face if someone tries to force the unlock and it won’t work.

> There’s WORSE companies out there

You don't get it. *Why does it matter if there are worse companies?* Do you wish to tell me what the single worst company is, so that that can be the only company I talk shit about?

If not, if it's OK for me to talk shit about apple, then why did you inject yourself into the conversation at all? Literally the only thing you showed up to say was, "that's all companies," which is just handing a pass to apple. Well, that and "If you want consumer rights then make your own devices and grow your own food" which is absolute horseshit.

Do you really think that people are buying apple products *instead of printers*? Because if you don't, your entire argument about the printer industry is apropos of nothing.

Who in the cell phone/tablet business has even more anti-consumer and anti-repair practices? Because you could almost argue that buying apple is better than buying that, if it existed, and if we again ignore the fact that *more than one thing can be bad enough to complain about*.

Dude, I literally responded to your entire argument, I didn't cherry pick anything. The vast majority of the comment I replied to was a supporting argument for the statement, "I'm not even trying to defend them." I made a counterargument to that, because I'm not going to bother making counterarguments against your personal opinions that are only marginally relevant to the actual argument you're attempting to support by stating them. 

Are you upset that I didn't respond to what you called your "biggest point?" Because honestly, it's so inane I couldn't bring myself to respond. You really think saying, "Apple gets more hate because they're popular" is a valid argument *against* criticizing apple?

Should we find the smallest company with anti-consumer practices and pick on them instead? Yeah, that'll make a *huge* difference /s

Being a big company means that criticizing them puts concerns about these types of practices in the spotlight. It's how you actually make a difference.

It doesn't matter whether or not you think you're a fanboy. The cognitive dissonance of having spent thousands of dollars and hours on their products tells your brain that you like them and should defend them, so you do.


What would satisfy you? If all the links I’ve posted don’t cut it? Some of them aren’t even technical. Like apple lobbyists writing NY “right to repair “ bill. Is the reporting wrong? Did apple lobbyists not actually write the bill? What are you looking for, I’ve provided sources.


the chip would then be calibration adjustment based on the background interference from the iPad.


I didn’t watch the video as I assumed they would summarise anything important. Apparently not.

I still don’t believe Apple are writing software to not quite work in this way. Apple are very capable of some shitty practices but this doesn’t seem like an intentional bug. 

I understand partly why apple don’t want every man with a screwdriver offering repairs on their products but companies of their size should be offering repairs at cost and not making repair equipment super expensive.

I’ve used third party components in iPhone repairs for years and they are often poor quality and poor quality repairs passed as “endorsed repairs” do devalue brands.

Hopefully apple will directly address this issue.


It’s not about knowing the PIN it’s about being able to identify as the legitimate user after that at will, through e.g. a replay attack. The screen itself can also be used to exfiltrate the pin or password being used too without the user’s knowledge, myself and many others have demonstrated that 15 years ago.

I would say that at most the middle ground should be a warning to the user and only allow a device quick login whilst maintaining Apple Pay disabled since the component lock is part of the certification process.


You can’t tamper with TouchID, you can attempt to bypass it with a lifted fingerprint which is rather difficult both because TouchID uses a 3D map of your fingerprint and most lifting techniques do not preserve depth correctly and that because thumbs are pretty much the most difficult prints to have a clean lift of due to how we touch things as humans.

Other than that for speed/UX TouchID has a 1:50000 of a false positive which is about 10 times that of the industry average for high security finger print biometric sensors.

I work in the industry I worked for 4 years for Cellebrite and the level of assurance that Apple provides at least on the hardware level is orders of magnitude over anyone else.


Except face ID uses depth sensing, and will not work with a flat photo. Maybe when it was first introduced, but definitely not now.


can you link to a reputable source demonstrating on video that face id can be defeated with a photograph?


Look it up for yourself. It's quite simple.


As someone with no skin in the game you can google this and find examples, articles and videos.


Maybe look at my reply to someone that has comprehension skills. 

They guessed and I answered affirmatively. It's astounding how tone deaf many of you are.


That depends on what your idea of a "feature" is.

My idea of a feature is a line-smoothing algorithm.

Your idea of a feature is being able to make a line at all.

I assure you that the latter consists of many functions.


> A12Z Bionic chip.

Interesting. I would’ve thought they’d reserve Z for Macs.. wonder why they didn’t go with just A13X. Looking forward to seeing the performance gap between A12X and A12Z.

128gb base storage yahooo

This is the Apple we know and love.


> iPadOS 13.4 with trackpad support will be available on **March 24**.


For those wondering, yes the new floating keyboard w/ trackpad supports the 2018 iPad Pro!

It’s not coming until May, but it looks awesome.


Good bet for LiDAR to be in the new iPhones as well. These are all more aspects in developing a hardcore AR platform. Makes me hopeful for where that technology is going with Apple.


That cantilevered hinge on the magic keyboard is so interesting. I'm really wondering how it handles being used in a lap, if it is better or worse than old iPads or Microsoft's surface. This could be huge, and the trackpad could open up the way for usable developer apps like Xcode or VSCode. I'm really excited about this!


> operates at the photon level 

Come the fuck on. Just say it uses light.


So glad they kept the same 799 starting price 

Not so glad about the trackpad cost tho


[deleted]


$299/349 for the keyboard?!?!?!?

EDIT: Still expensive, but backlit keys and what looks to be “built-in wireless charging” makes it a bit more palatable.


[deleted]


biggest surprise is that keyboard supports previous gen iPad Pros


Backlit keyboard yassss


Wait did they just announce a brand new iPad? Such an unceremoniously way of doing it.


The number of camera it has is more than the number of times I’ve use an iPad for taking pictures


Anyone going to ask about the RAM? I hope it's at least 6gb.


Lmao they only give you 240 for an iPad Pro trade in

Edit: Thanks stranger, first silver!!


TBH, the only thing I liked with the new iPads is that the price will drop on the old one.


exactly the same 5.9mm thickness as the previous generation ... I wonder if they’ve addressed the bending


I'm starting to see a pattern here. Apple's fancy hinges are kinda expensive


/s


$300 for the new keyboard is a crime. 

But I’m totally getting one for my iPad Pro 11 :|


This keyboard has backlighting, scissor switches, usbc charging pass through on the left side, and a trackpad. Still so expensive though


Wonder if this will bend too


Interesting that LIDAR takes the place of telephoto - guess the predictions of the 3 camera module being copy-pasted onto iPad were wrong. Also interesting from a marketing standpoint that they’re calling wide/ultra-wide “Pro” cameras when “Pro” cameras on iPhone is taken to mean wide/ultra-wide/telephoto.


Oof... $300-$350 for the new magic keyboards... hmmm so I have both 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros. Maybe I should trade both of them in for the newest 12.9-inch one


Is it just me or it seems like these new iPads are cheaper than previous ones? That 11" 256GB version looks very tempting...

Apple wants $299/$349 for the Magic Keyboard, jfc.  They saw what Google and Microsoft were charging for their keyboard covers and went full 'hold my beer'


Very impressed with the design of the cursor - doesn't appear to compromise the touch-first nature of iOS. Love it.


[deleted]


I was seriously about to order one of these until I saw the keyboard price. $600 in Australia. 

For the limitations of iPadOS, I can’t justify spending $2800 including an Apple Pencil and Keyboard. I was really looking forward to getting a new iPad, but my 13inch with touchbar works well enough. 

I get it’s a pro device, but $600 for a keyboard is disappointing. It’s not really a cost issue for me but I would rather keep that 3 grand; do I really need this iPad?


The new keyboard for the iPad Pro 12.9 in Canada is $450 bucks ...theyve lost it


Perfect for drawing since so many people are on lockdown!!! Can't wait to get one!! 

Btw which drawing, graphic design, photo/video editing, and CAD apps do you guys & gals highly recommend for the iPad? And just apps for iPad in general?


> iPad Pro is faster and more powerful than most Windows PC laptops

Get ‘em


Pretty happy I got the 2018 a few months ago now. This one doesn't look like much of an improvement.


Honestly what the iPad really needs is better support for external displays.

This is a real limitation and the current external display support is quite clunky and doesn't fit to screens properly. Its simply a sub-optimal experience. 

Proper ext. display support would be huge and a big step in replacing my laptop which just sits there as is plugged into a screen all day.

That keyboard is expensive !!


Too bad I don't have a job. Whoever can afford these right now is truly fortunate.


Star Trek "Tricorder".... here we come!!


Does the new folio keyboard work with the 2018 pro?


They keep saying it’s the new computer, if I have to put my phone into DFU and restore I still need a “computer”


Not sure if I missed it in the article. But is the new keyboard only going to fit the new iPad? Or can my last years pro use it too?


Looks awesome. More and more Apple is producing tech/products that I am genuinely interested in. I just can't switch until they remove the restrictions for default apps on iOS and iPadOS. I am far too entrenched in Google services to want to deal with Apple's defaults. Once they allow changing default apps I can see myself possibly switching from Windows/Android to macOS/iOS/iPadOS.


I need that Magic Keyboard for my 2018 iPad Pro, are they making one for that model? I looked but I can’t find it. If Apple really makes me buy a brand new iPad just for the keyboard compatibility I’m going to be pissed.


[deleted]


I don’t need it, I don’t need it, I don’t need it, I don’t need it. Fuck it I’ll buy one.


So glad to see the Magic Keyboard supports the 3rd gen iPad Pros. Going to be a game changer to have an Apple track pad instead of a half-assed attempt at mouse support.


Time to get the old 11 pro 🥴


OMG I just noticed the keyboard has the new USB-C charging port. It's good to assume that port can support hubs too right? I can have a dock and monitor ready to go.


What's a computer?

Answer: Apparently an iPad with a Magic Keyboard.

Looks cool though. From a technology standpoint, I love that they're continuing to push the envelope by adding new features that people may not know that they'd want to use yet.


How can a tiny mic that is picking you up through a tiny hole be studio quality?


[deleted]


The real question is is the new keyboard compatible with the previous gen iPad Pro


Is the pencil different than first gen?


Anyone else notice the person interacting with the iPad via a trackpad???!!!  I am buying one! iPad Air 2 you’ve served me well, but it is time to upgrade. 


https://youtu.be/w0P0FQ770dE


I just bought the latest 11 inch iPad Pro (refurbished) a week ago. Should I return and upgrade? I don’t see major changes in the iPad itself besides the camera, which would then make my current Smart Keyboard incompatible.
What do you think?


Did they say how much RAM it has?


The pricing on that 12.9 Trackpad keyboard...I called it. I knew it would be $300-400. This is a pass for me chief. I'll use that money towards a Macbook Air.


Just as I was trying to think of how to spend my new government-issued monthly stipend, Apple comes along and makes me question no more.


I don’t need it, but I kind of want it.


How is a iPad Pro cheaper than an iPhone?

Smh.

Edit: same quad camera. That retina screen. Similar processor. Why the phone so expensive?


That keyboard looks great, I'll just grab on for my existing iPad Pro, can't be too expensive eh...... A$589.00.


So basically, a laptop with extra steps?


This is getting awkward to use a MacBook...


So in plain english, apart from the camera upgrades and the numbers on paper - how much better is this iPad Pro vs the 2018 iPad Pros and is it worth upgrading? Or is this merely a spec bump? 

On a sidenote, that new magic floating keyboard keyboard looks dope, glad its backwards compatible and they finally returned the Apple logo to their accessories.


Honest question as I don't have an iPad. I see a lot of comments about keyboards and track pads. Why get an iPad over a MacBook or other laptop if you're going to buy the keyboard attachment?


I hope LiDAR can be used like a police speed gun and a 3D weather modeling sensor.


Is the ram still 4gb?


I'm an Android user, but Apple definitely makes better tablets while also making sure the OS suits the device.


Oh god that keyboard folio looks sick but I’m afraid find out the price.... No way Apple isn’t pricing that thing at the cost of a normal iPad.


Support multi-user accounts with multiple Apple ID login as well as Safari developer mode and I’ll buy a high end one


GUYS IT’S HAPPENING


That keyboard looks insane, i'll give them that. It also has a USB-C pass-through. I hope it's sturdy especially when you need to touch it.

Glad I gave my old iPad to my dad and now I'll be getting this. Thank you for making 126GB the default, should have been like that a long time ago.


Even though the new keyboard is super expensive, I would love to have it, but since I’m mainly using my iPad for writing with my pencil, I don’t think it would be fitting, since the iPad can’t be almost flat on this keyboard (like the Logitech one)


Only get $180 credit for trade in for my first gen iPad Pro 11 😢


When I can easily do web development on one of these I'll drop my macbook pro.


Hmm thinking I’ll finally upgrade from my iPad Air 2


Last year I sold my iPad Pro, Mac Mini combo. For a Surface Book. I love the Surface, but I’ll admit I miss my Apple devices. I think this new iPad Pro is the perfect reason to come back, maybe I’ll get a new iMac to go along with it, and sell the Surface.


Dear Apple, it is high time you revamped the storage on iCloud too!


That new keyboard looks awesome....


BUT IT'S $300/$350!!!


Apple must absolutely relish the fact that they had to release such a flagship product via Press Release. This is a product that must be sold via live demonstration to get the full effect.


Ooh, maybe I can use it for programm[notices lack of esc key]nope.


I just bought an iPad Pro 2 weeks ago. Can I return it for this one?


soo the new keyboard, does it support previous gen of ipad pro!?


Will this mean that the 2018 iPad Pros will be going on sale? I looked on the refurbished website and it looks like they’re still the same price.


i can't keep up man my iPad Pro 12" with thumb scanner still feels brand new to me lmao


I JUST bought one of those $125 Logitech keyboard cases for my iPad Pro 2017 thinking they wouldn't unveil a new iPad Pro until later this year. I got played.


I dig it. Depth camera is hot. 

If the track pad can work well with Remote Desktop then it will really be great. 

Still wanting a better vertical orientation situation for writing.


A trade in option for my keyboard folio would push me towards the new magic keyboard


Anyone got the new wallpapers? I’d love to have the high resolution wallpapers displayed.


Just ordered one for University,,,, I wanted to order the 2018 model two weeks ago, but with all the rumors I waited and it was damn worth it.

If now they also had a ide on that thing (and god knows it has enough power) I would be over the moon.

will be my first apple product and I am so excited for when it'll arrive march 25th


Congratulations Apple for creating the iPad that people always wanted! 

I’m really excited to try this baby out.


Does this mean we're gonna see the current model get a price cut?


Just preordered the 12.9 512gb with trackpad and pencil. Was hoping to get a better screen, but with this virus we may not see anything until 2021/22. Upgrading from a 32gb 5th gen.


Okay cool but how much cheaper are the old models going to be?


I am happy they are doubling down on the IPad as a computer concept. It means iPadOS 14 will be pretty epic.


Backlit keyboard and trackpad? That shit gon be expensive as hell


The million dollar question is, will this run ~~Skyrim!?~~ X-Code?


It has no radar, Geiger counter or O2 sensor? Disappointing.


I just want the trackpad.


Any word on an increase in RAM?


Will the keyboard work with the 2018 iPad Pro?


Then there’s me, who bought a Pro 11, 1TB about a month ago.
Color me stupid!


got an ipad pro last November and I love it. Is this model *really* that much better? My point is, this looks like a slight bump up but not a full on next level upgrade the way the iphone X was(compared to previous iphone models).


Any idea if thisll lower the 2018 version a couple hundred?


I still don’t understand how the iPad floats like that. Doesn’t seem like it’s supported enough.


New processor and cameras. Anything else other than the keyboard?


I'm so glad I didn't get tempted to buy my iPad a month ago, would've been MAD if I bought it and this new one came out now..   


MUST BUYYYYYYY


I wonder how Apple will differentiate Macbooks and the iPad. This was basically a competition to the Macbook Air in terms of lightweight and portability. This combines the best aspects of iPhones and Macs. I can only see that Macbook Airs becoming the cheapest Apple computer like what the iPhone 9 will become.


Trying to cash in on that stimulus check lol


Just give us terminal support on the ipad so I can replace my laptop.


Where I used to work a few years ago. LiDar tech was used to map and model archeological structures where other technology still couldn’t reach. 

Does this mean you could map objects or spaces with your iPad now?

Im excited but I don’t know if I’m idealizing this update.


I love that it is,

> faster and more powerful than most Windows PC laptops 

But not faster and more powerful than any Mac Laptop lol... Just the Windows ones!


Anyone know if mouse support work with chrome remote ? Would be so nice to control my computer with a mouse instead of touch .


Still no RAM specs? Procreate users been begging for more RAM. More layers.


Just in time for me to buy the 2018 Pro. Heh


> along with pro cameras, motion sensors, pro performance, pro audio

Next upgrade will add pro motion sensors.


[deleted]


The main change with the iPad is with the cameras and processor, but since I never use the cameras on mine and the 2018 version is still far from being maxed out, there’s no reason to upgrade. But that new Magic Keyboard? It truly has exceeded my expectations for what Apple were going to do. This is going to make massive changes for working on the iPad. That will be a day one purchase 😁


Is this (magic keyboard) compatible with an iPad Air 3?


The trackpad support is going to be incredible.


I was fully expecting a A13X. That's a bit underwhelming. Very curious to know why they wouldn't go for A13X? A12Z seems like a mere higher binned A12X - it's fine (A12X is still great), but now can't expect big leaps ahead with the same core architecture. They've had 1.5 years to work on A13X so I was just expecting more than this. So odd.

Honestly with so few meaningful changes I feel much better about my 3rd gen purchase. Still a beast of a tablet. Seems I'll be keeping it until at least the 2021 iPad Pro refresh at the minimum.


That hinge/design looks way better than that flip stand the Surface has


I know what I’m going to do with my federal COVID-19 stimulus check... 😊


[deleted]


This is an upgrade, but not a substantial one.  Time to buy a 2018 Pro for a fraction of the cost!


Am I the only one that genuinely was delighted by the ad "how to use a computer properly"? I was expecting it to be a cringefest after the reaction to "What's a computer?" but it was really amusing and I think it was kind of self-aware in regards to the old ad


a... a laptop?


🤦‍♂️ The timing.


Give me that keyboard/trackpad for my current iPad Pro and I just found my laptop replacement. Can’t wait till May! I have literally no reason to update my 2018 IPP


Man, after keyboard and pencil and tax, its like 1400. Freaking nuts. Super cool, but hard to justify that.


curious to see how many people will just stick with the old iPad Pro and just get the new keyboard, seeing as its compatible


I am super interested to know if they upgraded the chassis/exterior. The news about bending iPads made me wait for 6 months. I’m surely going to wait for a few days more before succumbing and getting this new one regardless.


Any word of trade in for the 3RD generation? It’s not an option available on the website.


Can’t wait for JerryRigsIt to open up this beautiful fucker.


Do we know anything about night-mode of the iPhone 11 coming to the iPad pro?


Has anyone seen if the Magic Keyboard folds back behind like the current Smart Keyboard Folio? Or does it just open up into the position they show in the ads?


I’d like to know the gap between the A13 and the A12Z myself. That could cause controversy.

EDIT: Heck, I’d like to to know the A12X Bionic vs. A12Z gap too. In some ways this might not even be much of an upgrade (single core performance seems most likely). Might be good to grab one of the remaining 3rd gens at a discount while you can if you don’t care about the cameras, since the new keyboard will work with it.


It’s very possible this will be the **development machine** for ARM Macs.


Maybe they're saving the letter 'm' for Macs?


Apple's new venture capital arm.


Edit: Thanks for the gold and silver! These are the most valuable commodities in these pre-post-COVID-19 times. I will be using them to buy toilet paper.

Gives me hope that the new Pro iPhones will start at 128gb.


With the Airs starting at 256GB as well, gives me hope


This should be a highlight! Cries in 64GB


Ooh noice


Technology used in NASA.......lmao that’s just one place ToF is used


Is there any TOF camera that doesn't?

If it was slower it wouldn't function


>operates at the photon level 

Yes, thanks Einstein. That's indeed how light works. 

No, literally, Einstein proved that light was quantized.


On all devices? (The trackpad support)


Works with Magic Trackpad! Looking forward to seeing the reviews of how well it’s implemented.


probably when people will be receiving them I guess


Do we know if the new pointer will also be for when using external mice?


It’s fucking expensive though.


I thought I was nuts for spending $180 on the smart keyboard folio but this is next level.


How do you know this, I can’t find that info


If you see the cutout for it, it’s quite large. Makes me wonder if the next “Max” sized iPhone will have a rectangular camera array.


[deleted]


can you give me some use cases for AR? its been touted as the future for years now but I've not seen anything that made me want it.


I believe it will be in 2021 iPhones.


Yup. I am sure Xcode for iPadOS will drop at WWDC.


VS Code and a Bash terminal/local file system on this bad boy and I’m buying one

Prob won’t ever happen unfortunately.


That hinge looks magical. [Seems very stable in the ad.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w0P0FQ770dE)


Being able to code on a tablet is really the only thing keeping me from getting one over a MacBook Pro.


Do the latest generation iPads do better that mirror their displays to an external monitor? Give me VSCode and good external monitor support and I’d probably jump on it. I’d miss some things about the MBP (I spend a significant amount of time on the command line, Vagrant, VirtualBox), but could work around that in the cloud.


Yup. I am sure Xcode for iPadOS will drop at WWDC.

Have to keep those fat margins during economic/society downfall lol


Not the Smart Keyboard.

Only the Magic Keyboard for iPad has it :p


Wow, this is actually a huge selling point for me


I wonder if there will be less power because it's coming through the smart connector? I can't imagine my 29watt usb-charger charging the ipad through the keyboard. I hope we can use the keyboard as a alternate input as an option.


It is awesome, but please remember it's just pass through charging. 

You won't be able to dock out of that one cable.


Figured it would be expensive, but damn! It’s almost half the price of the base iPad Pro model! Wonder if they’ll release one for non-pro models. Probably not due to the size needed for the track pad, although a tracks pad less model would work.


Does it work with the previous gen iPad Pro?


And don't forget this thing will likely be useless if a future iPad changes its form factor/design. I was very interested in this but for that kind of money I'd expect to use it with several generations of iPads, but I have my doubts.


450 bucks in Canada, that's kinda outrageous and money isn't really an issue


Still only $129 for a magic keyboard and $129 for a magic trackpad

will they accept toilet paper as payment?


Wow, that is expensive


That's not palatable at all WTF?!


Nothing makes that palatable. The keyboard would have to do my work for me. And I am not frugal, especially when it comes to apple products. That is obscene.


That's reason enough for me to write off using Apple products. That's insane...


Get a laptop instead


[deleted]


More likely is that penny pinchers at Apple decided that 128 was cheap enough. But I could finally buy a base model - except I still find no reason to upgrade from my 2017 12.9” model.


Fucking Apple. 128GB is utterly useless and nobody should be allowed to buy it. 256GB is the minimum usable storage and anyone with a different use case than me is an idiot who doesn't know what they want, and Apple should be ashamed for catering to those idiots by selling them an unusable piece of hardware.

/s , but I am 100% sure someone will say it in earnest.


Not too big of a surprise. 

1. They know there's a large market for a keyboard with trackpad. 
2. They also know that this is not a huge upgrade from last year's model, so to make it exclusively for the new model would alienate many of the customers (esp creatives) that they have worked hard to get back. 
3. Brydge already has one on track for the older model. Apple would lose a lot of profit if Brydge ends up being the only ones supplying a trackpad version for the older models.


Only the 2018 iPad Pros which isn’t really surprising considering they’re almost the same shape except for the camera.

I opened youtube just now and confusingly seen an ad


[Apple: New iPad Good](https://www.theonion.com/apple-new-iphone-good-1819573004)


Not exactly the best time to do some high energy big reveal like Apple normally does.


A new MacBook Air and upgraded Mac mini  too


Really unfortunate timing. These are the most exciting product updates I’ve seen from Apple in a few years.


Better than getting higher levels of backlash for a $300-$350 keyboard


I use the camera all the time (to scan documents only). hah. maybe with the LiDAR I can scan pieces of paper at the “photon level”.


When I’m over 60, I’ll use the iPad as my main camera.


It was 6GB on the 1TB 2018 so it’s entirely possible it could be across the board. Well have to wait for iFixit to tear it down.


Yep I’m wondering the same thing. I hope they brought 6GB for all models and not just 1TB.


I know right. I checked it up to see howm uch my 11inch would be but $240 and no option for 11 inch. I hope the 3rd gen ones have a trade in value of at least $400 but I think it's too much to hope for. Guess ill keep mine for now and wait until they release one with some kind of LED display and actual HDR certification.


This was extremely disappointing


SHE ESCAPED! GET HER BACK IN QUARANTINE!


Looks like this image could fit into r/surrealmemes


I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt this time. While there wasn't any outward change of thickness this time around, there could be any magnitude of internal changes, be it strengthened aluminum, or more internal support. That said, I'm still waiting till the teardown.


Had to scroll too far for this.


/s is generally used to denote sarcasm. Your post seems to be right on.


Same. My response: holy shit that’s expensive! Oh well. Buying it anyway. Looks awesome


Pretty sure Logitech will come out with a better keyboard for like half that


With iDevices, Pro just means more.


Sweet, my wife’s 11 is also a Pro now! Leaving *MY* Pro to feel left out and not unique anymore!


Why do you have both?


[deleted]


Base is $100 more in Australia, but subsequent models are the same price.


I believe they're actually $100 more. They are for the base model, at least.


Looks like the same starting prices in the US, but now you get double the base storage. The 256GB and 512GB options are $50 cheaper and the 1TB is $250 cheaper.


Rumor is that’s coming in a new 12” this fall, presumably with A14x & overlap with ARM compatible macOS


Yep.  I would've upgraded from the 2018 model for a better display.  But a slightly faster processor and a much nicer camera aren't important enough for me to bother.


You are way overthinking this. I have an 11" Pro with the A12x, it is MORE than enough. I don't see myself upgrading for a while and getting one has been the best thing for me, I no longer use my laptop and note taking is incredible with it.


Have you set the kids iPad up to just run D+ in Safari? That works fine for me with a shortcut on the home screen.


Yep. A cornerstone "feature" IMO would be to dramatically improved file management.

I've heard a lot of stubborn arguments about the iPad just being a different device that shouldn't be any more like a laptop, but Apple does seem to be slowly realizing laptop-like features into iPadOS, just not fast enough.


[deleted]


Couldn’t agree with this more. A MacBook is still superior AND less expensive. The only thing this has over the MacBook is camera capabilities. But how many people are doing serious photography with their iPad?


Well there is https://continuous.codes/

But yeah most of the power right now seems wasted. Hopefully the software catches up.


>	As long as the OS isn’t evolving what will you do with all, that power? Are people using this productive?

The OS is evolving, and if you read this it makes it clear who is currently taking advantage of this - people dealing with photo, video, audio, modeling, and rendering. 

Photo software has jumped by leaps and bounds recently - the ML enhancements Pixelmator Photo has made are astounding. 

https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2019/12/17/all-about-the-new-ml-super-resolution-feature-in-pixelmator-pro/


There's more to productivity than coding. Being able to have Excel, a near full fledged browser with a file explorer in this form factor is incredibly useful. 

I traded in my MacBook Pro to buy my iPad Pro + Mac Pro (2009). I rarely touch my Mac Pro.


It doesnt have to fit your job to be used by professionals. I use my iPad to edit photos and write on PDFs (company bought my pencil for my personal iPad). You have no idea how many of each I’ve worked on while waiting for the waitress to bring my food.


IME, the only crowd bemoaning the iPad’s usefulness as a laptop replacement right now are developers. Artists, musicians, photographers, videographers, and office workers have the ability to move most if not all of their workflow to the iPad. Just because you can’t also code on an iPad doesn’t mean it’s not a viable alternative.


The keyboard cover costs more than the baseline iPad non-pro. That's pretty crazy.


Just get a third party keyboard and track pad


Wow.. $600 is redonkulous


Well so much for not waiting for MBA/MBP13 refresh announcement..

edit: OMFG THERE’S A MBA REFRESH AAAAAAAAHHHH


Drawing: Procreate or Adobe Fresco (if you have CC)

Graphic Design: Affinity Designer replaces illustrator for me. Vectornator is also a decent alternative when you need something done quick. 

Photo editing: Photoshop and Lightroom are available. Pixelmator photo is also cool. 

Video editing: Luma Fusion


Procreate


I wonder how they're backing that up. Aren't they essentially saying that its faster than most Macbooks as well here?

Are they just looking at burst speeds here?


I mean, I think it has been that way since 3rd gen? Maybe even 2nd gen. Still, that 'faster and more powerful than most windows pc' label gets a bit useless when those weaker PCs can do more than my iPad pro. The current files system itself is telling. It is very basic.


Well, it seems the improvement I was so excited for (magic keyboard)is available for the 3rd gen too.


While reading the article I was a little scared that the new Magic Keyboard wouldn't be usable with my 2018 version. 

Since that's not the case I'm only bummed out that they only now boosted the base storage to 128gb.


Well we now have a way to interact with external displays properly. Now we just have to hope iOS 14 brings better external display support!


Yes


Compatible with the following:

* iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd and 4th generation)
* iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st and 2nd generation)

[Source](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/)


Just found this [link](https://www.apple.com/ca/ipad-keyboards/select/) confirming its for the 2018 pro models and here’s a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/uIbxquP.jpg) of it.


It’s compatible


It's basically Microsoft moving in the opposite direction of Apple. They're making a laptop into a tablet, where Apple is making a tablet into a laptop


And what’s worse is that there’s no reason for the software to be gimped. It’s an extremely powerful device, but Apple’s increasingly draconian App Store restrictions, plus file management that’s still pretty limited, means it’s still less useful than a PC laptop. 

I loved my iPad Pro but I just couldn’t get work done on it as easily as my Surface 3, which is otherwise inferior in every way.


I just want to be able to write code on one of these things. I wish Apple gave some sort of incentive to get companies to develop IDEs and compilers for iOS.


Sadly gave up and sold my iPad Pro last month for this reason. 

I told myself for a year that I could do web dev on it. While I could in fact do it, it was so fucking annoying. 

I’m quite happy back on a MBP. That’s just me though for my workflow. I loved everything else about the iPad Pro.


Yeah this is kind of pathetic. Especially when compared to a Surface, the iPad Pro is such a joke even with a keyboard and trackpad. iOS is baby software in comparison to a real desktop OS.


I agree. I bought an 11" iPad Pro for simple trimming of videos as well as a drawing tablet. The drawing tablet aspect was great but it absolutely sucked to have to have use icloud storage in order to see my fully exported final cut pro videos, and share to trimming apps. I returned it


According to their site, yup!


Well there was a 2nd generation released previously, but there is no new 3rd gen pencil.


if you paid retail, and you can be arsed, yes


Yes, if only for the resell value

Also storage starts at 128 for the Same price vs 64 on your model


return it


It starts at $300


I don’t understand why someone would use the trade in option, when you can sell your device for way more on any site like, kijiji, ebay,etc.
Trade in is a scam.


Should be able to. Majority retailers offer 14 day exchanges.


Yes, it'll support the 1st and 2nd Gen of the 11" and the 3rd and 4th Gen of the 12.9".


$349


That’s pretty much the only thing holding me back from pulling the trigger on this


Nope. Only Pros with the squared off design.


Don’t really care for AR, so the cameras are useless. The A12Z implies it isn’t that much faster than 2018’s. The rumor about another iPad Pro releasing later this year with a mini led display seems about right. That’s the real prize


My guess is it’s based on A12X’s technology but improved and optimized.

edit: They didn’t even compare speed to the last gen on their website this time.


I agree, the 3rd gen is the way to go.  I have a 11 inch 3rd gen, wanted to use it as a macbook air replacement but once I got a keyboard case it was too small.  Today after the update I snagged an apple refurbed 12.9 256 for 829 and plan to sell my 11.

The magic keyboard does look great, but still debating if I want to drop 300 on a keyboard case.  I bet some decent 3rd party options arrive by May.


Based on the info available it’s exactly the same as the A12 X in terms of architecture besides maybe more RAM across the board 6GB and Wi-Fi 6 support. Otherwise a very incremental update. Anyone who has the 2018 models should NOT upgrade to this. I was hoping for at least a better/brighter screen. New keyboard is cool and I’ve wanted a backlight but $349 for 12.9 is pushing it. LIDAR sensor for depth is also cool but kinda silly on a tablet even for AR.

Curtesy of u/TWYFAN97


We have to wait for Anandtech and their review of the A12Z it will take a while as they go deep


Not really a good development machine if it only runs iPadOS


Hahahahahaha


[deleted]


That was my initial thought too. Here’s to hoping!


I wouldn't go that far with hopes


Wow, the Air now has 8gb RAM and 256gb storage for $999 USD. Pretty good pricing imo.


We at Dundee mifflin have shipped billions of units of product that is used by companies such as Halliburton, Proctor & Gamble and Pop Copy


"Our LiDAR works on the atom level"

sensor: huh?


I’m pretty sure. It’s listed on the [iPadOS webpage](https://www.apple.com/ipados/) with no particular model information.


Any iPad running 13.4! Including third-party USB and Bluetooth mice.


Yeah it even supports Air 2


Yes


If it functions well, I would pick it up for my iPad Pro, I am very happy with my current iPad but would love a better keyboard and a track pad so this may be what keeps me from wanting an actual laptop for some tasks.


Holy fuck, $300.

The Smart Keyboard Cover was $130...I mean I won't deny this is a significantly cooler design, but I have a laptop for a reason. 

And I'm not sure iPad+Keyboard/Trackpad for $1,100 is a better idea than a MacBook Air for less than $1,000.


Shit for that price I'd want a full Cherry MX setup on a steel plate. Go ahead and enrobe in 24k gold for me while you're at it.


I mean it’s Apple. We knew what we were getting ourselves into. Sucks that they charge ridiculous prices for everything, but there’s literally no substitute.

I bought a SurfacePro and hated it. Returned it the next day.


Apple has the best trackpads tho.


I'm personally going to wait to see what Brydge comes out with. I have their current Pro keyboard, and it's incredible. Makes the iPad feel like a Macbook.


This keyboard costs more than the regular iPad.


https://i.imgur.com/D1zsXiL.jpg


Oh snap. That’s a really good point. I’m kind of excited to see if it’ll really be on there, and if so, how they’ll do it.


Agreed. Hopefully we won’t have to wait too long to see side by sides.


Absolutely. The mains uses really differ between short and mid term (as the tech improves) but I’ll give a few examples of both. For the present and short term you have simple consumer facing stuff (think games that incorporate physical space of seeing how a life sized IKEA couch looks in your room) and professional professional applications (being able to annotate physical objects with useful instructions or notes.

All that said, mid to long term stuff is the true potential. Limited now only by core technologies (high quality head mounted displays/power sources for them) that are still in their infancy. Apple is using the interim to develop established tech (camera/LiDAR) and a diverse platform by including that in their product lines. The potential in the next 5 years is hard to predict, but assuming the tech matures it’d be a paradigm shift akin to modern smartphones taking over. Anything you could imagine a hologram being used for, making gaming more immersive (imagine TCG or tabletop games with modeling and animations), augmenting how people learn, how they’re trained, how we interact with technology at all.


I’m not sure but man I hope


Doubt


If you want a bash shell, there's https://ish.app/ which lets you run x86 Alpine Linux on your device. It integrates with iOS really really well (multiwindow, Files app, and so on). Unfortunately it doesn't support more complex instructions so some things like Java8+ and Golang don't work but it's still great for tons of things


 If it does it will be my next big purchase.


Looks like they took the pro display tech and shrunk it down.


Oof, the way they use it in the ad suggests that it can't go all the way around like the existing keyboard. I really liked being able to swap from keyboard mode to writing mode really quickly and if I have to tear my iPad off the keyboard, move the keyboard out of the way, and then write on a now camera-bump-wobbly surface I'm probably not going to get this


Developers are free to do whatever they want with external displays, but I don’t think there are very many apps that support it, because not very many people use it. And you can’t really interact with the non mirrored display. 

Virtualbox would be absolutely killer.


iPad will always be best as a thin client. AWS, Citrix, and VMware all have nice offerings to play with what you need.


I’ve been wishing for this since the rumor of the first iPad Pro :/


Finally! Thank you!


did you account for taxes yet?


Not gonna lie. Decent chance I’d use it on this.


*thicc


That's what I'm wondering. Like, surely the smart connector on the back isn't literally just USB-C in the form of three contacts, right?


I mean if you have a dock then you should already be able to do display out and charging over the primary port right?


No, but it will alleviate the need for a dock for many users. It will allow you to charge through the keyboard and use the primary port for headphones/memory cards. It's still possible to attach a dock to the primary port. The port on the keyboard is also better for charging as it is going to be at the base of the device. The fact that the cord has to dangle from the middle of the iPad to charge it while you work can be problematic at times.


No, Apple won’t be releasing a magic keyboard for regular iPad/Air. This is for the Pro line only. Sorta ridiculous to think that a $300+ accessory would be released for a $329/499 iPad.


It costs more than the entry level iPad lol


[Yes](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/)


Compatible with
iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd and 4th generation)
iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st and 2nd generation)


Thankfully, iPads last long enough where you don't have to upgrade with every hardware revision.


At the same time, you should be able to get 5+ years out of it so it's not the worst value proposition ever


Yeah it’s not like Apple has a track record of using the same body design over and over for products.


Right. Once they came out with the Pencil 2.0 I resigned myself to the fact that all of these accessories are like cases - one use only.


Yeah...I can swing it, but damn that is just absurd at this point.


I was hoping for an iPad keyboard just like this but have missed laptop functionality... Considering I could get a full laptop for *only* 3x the price of this keyboard I may just go that route...


It is **more expensive** than the base iPad.


[deleted]


Looks like they moved the microphones. The placement is what caused weak points


That was my first question about it, I guess we’ll have to wait until our good friend JerryRigEverything gets his hands on one.


What’s the Bridge trackpad like? With how good the trackpads are for Mac, I bet they weighed the economics of making this an exclusive feature for the new iPad. Can’t imagine anyone else competing without apple’s official collaboration.


I get why they did it but you could've at least at Phil Schiller in an empty room flicking through a keynote, pausing at random moments so the audience can applaud at home.


I am a little disappointed they didn’t call the CEO Tim Apple.


You can easily sell it for 400 though, no need for trade in,


[deleted]


They know their audience too well 😅


I sure hope they do, competition is better for the consumer.


Or Brydge. I love my current one.


Do you need a hug?

I offer a social distancing hug to you. 🤗


Oh um, one of them I received as a gift


I can understand it. I have the 12.9, but there are times I wish I had the smaller one, even though I like the larger one generally


I think 50 more, but the base storage has doubled.


They’ve improved file system management immensely in iPadOS over the last few years. It’s still not a desktop os but it’s certainly headed that way.


You'd think a powerful ARM processor would make sense for the MacBook air when Microsoft and Samsung already have ARM windows laptops


This is exactly what I'd like to see. Or just generally a way to freely load software onto my iPad


[deleted]


OP was merely using programming as an example of something a “pro” user still can’t do on the iPad Pro, which is a shame because IDEs and code compilation could really take advantage of its power. Same goes for video editors, photographers, web designers... none of those people can use the iPad Pro to do their job because the applications simply aren’t available yet.

Right now, the iPad Pro is still an overqualified productivity and multimedia device. No doubt that it runs Office apps just fine and you can do the majority of stuff most people do on their laptop such as browsing and emailing, but the iPad Pro has much more potential than that and having all this power for that stuff is a bit silly. A Surface Go costs less than half of the iPad Pro and can do all that stuff as well.


I use Excel all the time, and the iPad sucks for it. It would be better with the cursor, but it's still missing key features that I use every day.


I am interested in trying it out though.  I got a Pixel Slate with the Byrdge keyboard and it's freaking amazing, functionally indistinguishable from a regular laptop when it's in it - works great on my lap, fully adjustable viewing angle, nice rigid typing surface.  I don't love the process of getting it in and out, no where near as nice as just popping on a magnetic one, but it's a minor issue for what I consider the gold standard for convertibles.

That said, my pixel slate, keyboard and stylus was $449 total out the door, with 18 month same as cash financing.  Can barely get the Apple keyboard for that price 😬


The air was updated too.

https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/18/2020-macbook-air-announced/


Affinity Photo an alternative?


Same with me I was cursing myself buying the 2018 until I read that the new keyboard is compatible with it. I wonder if they’ll accept the old one in a trade in?


Camera cutout will be ugly tho 😔


Thanks so much!


Thanks habibi


great news but that pricing is crazy! glad it works with the 2018 pros


Apple's approach is nicer while Microsoft's is more powerful. I have a feeling Apple will win in the long run, since Windows is still a mess of legacy technologies. It doesn't even have accidental touch rejection, something Apple perfected with the first iPad 10 years ago! Just because Windows supports "touch" doesn't mean it's a real touch OS.


Imagine having VS Code on it...that would be fucking sick


Whilst they're not without issue I commend Microsoft for creating products that properly understand the benefits and drawbacks of a touchscreen interface. It seems like Apple are far too attached to the original iPad architecture and don't want to fragment the ecosystem which is holding the Pro line back. If anything the iPad Pro should function more like a MacBook than its iPad brethren.

They didn't even add function keys to their new keyboard ffs.


*guttural noise as if being stabbed*


the lord is happy


I believe it’s an A12X with one more GPU core.  (8 vs 7)


I'm really interested to know what changed.


Well, the A12X has a 7 core GPU and the A12Z has an 8 core GPU, that alone could bring a 15% boost in graphics. Could be 7nm+ as well.


You should get the Bridge Keyboards I believe they have a trackpad. And I think they’re sold at Apple stores too.


But if you don't currently have an iPad and are looking for one, this is probably the way to go over the 2018 model, right?

I'd honestly be fine with the 2018 model, but I've heard it struggles with RAM management, so if there is an upgrade there, I'm thinking that's probably the better move. Oh and base storage of 128 is nice too


They will allow it to run the ARM macOS.


It could be that they're used as internal + close partner test rigs that run a modified version of macOS at first. Unlikely, since they almost definitely have ARM Macs in-house for R&D, but not unheard of. The first versions of certain products were all run off of franken-machines: [the iPhone](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18263844/apple-iphone-prototype-m68-original-development-board-red), [Intel Macs](https://www.quora.com/Apple-company/How-does-Apple-keep-secrets-so-well), etc.


Services are eating the world.

Doubt! But would be amazing!


With this plus the MacBook Air storage upgrade, I think this might be the year. The price they charge for the Pros is absurd.


Base model is an i3 now, but I think for most people the storage is more important.


That isn't a good price


[deleted]


Wow. Amazing!!!


How is this different than what we have had through accessibility?


Source / screenshot?


Nice! Glad Apple still supports older devices with the latest and greatest.


The giant camera hole would bother me￼￼


I wanna try first. The track pad is relatively small in comparison to MacBook and I’m not sure I will get use to it.

I think it really takes off when you have things like Google glasses, HUD's in consumer vehicles.  Think things like using turn-by-turn directions and not just getting "turn left in 500 m" but also an arrow or other indicator that show you that this is exactly where the turn is ahead.  Imagine doing a repair on something, looking through the glasses and having some indication that this part goes in this slot using this tool.  

There's a good argument for getting this kind of technology in the hands of users, providing APIs and seeing what happens.


I can imagine it functioning really well in a retail setting, and also in science and engineering fields. I think it's hard to imagine at this time, but as we become more connect through a digital space I can imagine it becoming a staple in the future tech industry


[deleted]


Explains the $300+ cost...


Keep a plain folio case handy.


Now you can, due to trackpad/mouse support


Agreed. I just need to adopt the view that I either need to be online (which I am the vast majority of the time) with tmux / ssh sessions) or I need to go without command line tooling. All possible. It just means a shift in mentality, I’m so used to being able to easily do local Ansible development and testing (for example). Maybe I just buy a rPi 4 to run locally for those sorts of needs. Heck, I suppose that’s portable too!

It's a one-wire protocol. The three pins are Ground, Power and Data.


> Sorta ridiculous to think that a $300+ accessory would be released for a $329/499 iPad.

They already have a $159 keyboard for a $329 iPad.  I’m not saying they’re gonna release a pro keyboard for the 7th gen/Air but their accessory pricing can get a little ridiculous.


I was thinking a model without the track pad but keeping the backlit keys. That would reduce the price but it’s not out side of the realm of possibility that they release an expensive accessory for a cheaper product. If people will but it then why not?


That’s the best news!! Depending on performance gains (and I don’t care about the time of flight sensor) just getting the new keyboard should feel like a nice upgrade for my 2018 iPad Pro!


It’s weird, if you look at the compare iPads page it has just the folio keyboard listed for the 3rd gen 12.9 iPad Pro. But like you said the keyboard page says both the 3rd and 4th are compatible


I have the original iPad Pro 12.9” from Christmas 2015. While this new version is badass, I still can’t justify replacing mine yet.


Definitely. If you have a gen 2 right now youre still fine until the next iteration. Ill be keeping my gen 3 until at least the next release


The first Apple Pencil didn’t get a revision for three years. How is that one use only? It’s also still compatible with lightning connector iPads.


I agree, I can't really justify spending that much with the way things are atm.


So did everyone else, because it wasn’t a big issue.


That’s kind of sad imo


To be honest neither this nor the new MacBook Air seem like big enough changes to have a full keynote about.


No, no! 

Have Phil pause. Take out his own iPhone, press a big 'applause' button. It plays, very quietly, and then he continues. 

*hire me apple!*


Zipping through a spec sheet firing off speeds and feeds!


Old article.


And there are times I really wish I had the larger model lol


Definitely. I ended up getting a 9.7 ipad just for that reason


Hmm, maybe that's the thing. I was checking prices 2 - 3 months ago, I remember thinking that it was bit expensive for the given storage.


app compatibility is still a huge issue.


If this happens I’d be happy to get rid of my surface and get an iPad and call it a day for upgrading devices for the near future. But I’m okay with watching Netflix on my iPhone for now if I’m on a short plane/bus/train ride. And sending emails. And paying bills. Haha. I hate that there’s no equivalent to the surface from Apple still cuz I’d just like to be able to text people from a keyboard and do CAD design at the same time. This is still a pretty cool iPad though. Apple releases things so slowly.


For me it has replaced my desktop machine for everything except storage/backup. 

I like the the Pencil on screen so much better than Wacom tablets, and between Pixelmator and Affinity 99% of my needs are met. 

>	For modeling and rendering the people I need more cores and processing power than even most laptops have and usually have a desktop with a threadripper. If you do this an iPad is just childs play.

For things like movies and AAA games - duh. But for smaller tasks and prototyping it works really well. 

>	I’m just saying that in my opinion telling people that this can replace a traditional laptop is bullshit.

It definitely has for me. I haven’t had a laptop for years. Currently have an iPad Pro and an old Mac Mini that I rarely use.


SPLOOSH


Affinity Photo on iPad is excellent, and much more full-featured than Photoshop on iPad at this point. Just know that it takes some time to build competency with it. That said, it’s absolutely irreplaceable for me, with the best masking tool I’ve ever used on any platform.


Really no accidental rejection at all? What about palm rejection?


I think the A12X was manufactured with eight GPU cores, I expect that a single core was disabled to improve manufacturing yield. It always seemed strange to have a 7 core GPU.


Perhaps, I'd think they always had the 8th core in the original A12X design but disabled it to improve yields.


Well yeah that’s how they would do it... but that’s making the assumption that it is definitely the ARM development machine, which it most likely isn’t.


Neil Peart stands alone.


You think they will offer the base iMac with an SSD now?

I mean, it's just unbelievable that they're selling a $1,300 iMac with a **5,400 HDD**. Not even Fusion Drive (which should have been phased out in 2011 anyway).


I absolutely think most people will be fine with the i3. a lot of people just buy it for internet and word-processing etc. the storage was absolutely stupid and way too expensive, and now not so much. faster ram, better graphics, more storage, most importantly imo, a real keyboard. So much easier to recommend a $1k device like this. I think it is NOW a great laptop for a lot of people whereas the old one I wouldn't really recommend to someone or feel good about it at least.


> but I think for most people the storage is more important.

I'd say that easily 50% of the airs that hit my bench for work can't do a fuckign OS upgrade because their teeny tiny SSDs are full. thankfully there is usually 20-30 gigs worth of IOS updates and cache files I can clean up.

at least with the 2017 and earlier, you could upgrade the SSD. with these new ones, anything less than 256 would be criminal


the icelake i3 is better than the old 14nm amber lake Y series i5


The Ice Lake i3 is still an upgrade over the previous 14nm quadrouple warmed over dual core. But 150 (CAD) to upgrade to a quad core is quite reasonable, that's the config I'd get.


It really isn't

My laptop is the same price. Has 5x the storage, 4x the RAM, GTX 1650, and runs Windows.   
ಠ\_ಠ


Thought he/she was being sarcastic but now I can’t even tell.


With this, 3rd-party KB/M support, an actual file explorer, and multi-windowing, probably the only thing left that could make iPadOS better is setting default apps. It's the last thing Apple.


Yeah. One you won’t need accessibility mode on and it also has a different cursor that adapts to what you hover it over. Probably shows it better in the new iPad Pro video


The accessibility cursor was always a workaround. That’s why the cursor also looked ugly af. This is an official feature and thus much more polished.


From the press release page
>	Trackpad support will be available on any iPad running iPadOS 13.4, and work with Apple’s Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2 and the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. Third-party mice connected over Bluetooth or USB are also supported.


Ooooo, I didn’t even think about that...


Just means that you can keep your new keyboard if and when you upgrade to the current iPad now rather than buying two of these expensive keyboards: one for the 2018 version and one for the 2020 version.


I’m sure it’s going to be the same haptic trackpads they use on MacBooks. Which are unanimously claimed as the best trackpads ever by both Apple and windows users. I have it in my MBP and it is absolutely amazing. Although I guess there must not be much gesture support since it’s so small.


That's what I'm hoping for.  I'm an architect and spend a fair amount of time measuring existing conditions.  LIDAR scanning like this is not a magic bullet - it tends to generate a point cloud of literally millions of 3d dots.  I still have to work with that to lay out walls, floors and the like in CAD, but this will help accuracy and completeness, if it works well for that scale.


Exactly. Throw that in with the new tags and you could see how far in the couch your keys are. Not to mention creative and industrial use.


https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/8/20776247/google-maps-live-view-ar-walking-directions-ios-android-feature

That feature in AR glasses would be amazingly useful.


I don’t think AR will really “hit” until a glasses-type thing is released.  I love the idea, but with the current tech, you have to wave your phone around to start it and then hold it up the whole time you use it.  It’s cool, but not practical.  LIDAR might help that startup time, and more importantly will allow real-world occlusion of virtual objects.


Exactly the same examples they fed us in 2014.


This is why I could never go back from the LTE version of my iPad. I’m rarely in an area without internet, usually only when I’m camping in the middle of BFE. I’d look into a portable cluster of RPi Zeros or the Compute Modules. There is a board I saw recently that put I think 7 of the compute modules together on a single board.


Nothing stopping you from getting any bluetooth keyboard and a magic mouse for half the cost of the keyboard though.


Because people wouldn’t. That would cost over $200. Not a big market for that expensive of a keyboard when they’re buying $300 iPads.


Yup, same here! Really happy Apple didn't pull an Apple and make this only compatible with the new generation, since my iPad pro is still an absolute beast and I see no reason to update it anytime soon. Hands-down my favorite iPad since the very first one I got almost 10 years ago.


Exactly what I was thinking. The keyboard situation is the one issue I’ve had with mine. I’ve been waiting for this announcement and hoping for backward compatibility


I was thinking get the Refurb last gen 11" pro with that new swanky keyboard

But honestly, the way my work goes right now, I use a desktop more often than a mobile device, so I'm still waiting for a fabled next gen iMac


Most people (including myself) don’t upgrade every time. And the original Apple Pencil was upgraded after the iPad Pro was upgraded a second time (meaning it only lasted one upgrade cycle). So unless you upgraded from 1st to 2nd gen iPad Pro, the original 
Apple Pencil wasn’t something you could carry on to your next iPad Pro.


Yeah...I was getting close to be ready to buy a new car and now that shit is on hold until things stabilize.


Well yes but actually no. Pl were getting lpads bent out of box


And yet, I would watch every second of it.


[deleted]


I dno, I’d really like to hear the marketing speak about putting fucking lidar in a tablet.


Most likely yeah.  These could literally just be top binned A12X’s - minor bump in clock speeds and 8th gpu enabled.


Probably. Odd number CU is always weird


They may build In an arm macOS mode when it’s connected to Xcode or something for people to write apps on.

Or they could go the Intel mac route and ship developer machines to people in secret. 

But if we/they want lots of apps on launch day, it makes sense to do it this way. 

Regardless, we’ll know soon enough. WWDC is in June after all :)


Now we just need more first- and third-party professional-grade apps. Adobe is getting there. Apple would be wise to release FCP X and Logic X on iPad.


[removed]


That said, the accessibility cursor did actually gain some of the features from the proper cursor support as well.  So it'll be a bit better on iPhone/iPod if you used AssistiveTouch there.


Omg, hell yeah! I can’t wait.


I have a Magic Mouse with replaceable batteries.. is this still the Magic Mouse one?


I see a market for a gap-filler insert if Apple doesn't decide to make one already. Kickstarter?


Yeah, but they allowed the first gen pencil to be used with 3 other iPads. It’s not like they dropped it completely


Sure. But as you just said, most people don’t upgrade every cycle, one of Apple’s biggest issues with the iPad is that people _don’t_ upgrade for years. It’s not like the pencil shuts off after a year. If you have the iPad for five years, your pencil lasts five years.


We are in a mist of a recession if not already in it. Gas is gonna be cheap and no ones gonna buy a new car in a recession, Ford/GM already doing 0% finance. You could probably save money to get a Tesla while gas is getting cheaper.


For sure, id imagine a lot of people will be taking that approach, or hopefully they would be lol


There would be 2 of us at least watching


In fairness, Austin was playing to the situation. Lol


Show some respect! That performer is Stone Cold Steve Austin

thank you for calling them performers and not fighters


This


I mean AMD's raven ridge and picasso chips (their ryzen 2000 and 3000 cpus with graphics) all had 11 CUs physically on die. People thought there was a 12th that was there for yeilds but no


Think they’ll actually discuss it at WWDC?


I want Xcode dammit. I want to make apps on the platform I'm making them for.


>I had to change a file extension on iPadOS. You simply can’t.

I [posted about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/fgh5nu/reasons_why_files_sucks_3_no_such_thing_as_this/) and got downvoted by fanboys claiming that this is a niche feature nobody needs and that file extensions shouldn’t exist anyway.

**However** this is my current solution: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/13c1f758ffc54a1babb98452b16140f0


You’d need quite a lot of demand in order to bring supply costs down to a reasonable price and it’s just like with the iPhone 11, no one cares anymore:


Well, I'm WFH for the foreseeable future, so no gas needed from my POV. But a used Model 3 is the intent once things improve.


and my axe!


Yeah. Kuo Says arm Macs later this year or early next.


I dunno, for me, there is nothing to justify the upgrade from the current iPad pro to the new one. I rarely use the camera, everything runs smoothly on 4GB of RAM and the current processor. No upgrades to the form factor, display, or pencil integration. And I could be wrong, but I don't see many people doing video editing primarily on their iPad pro. The biggest upgrade is the keyboard by far.

This will also drive the 2018 prices down even further, making them more appealing.


Hasn't this been the case for several years?  While I don't see a ton of ads for iPad, I don't see any for Android tablets anymore and haven't for quite some time.


It’s not a surprise to me that tablet sales are stagnant in this economy. More so than phones and laptops, it’s a luxury purchase that most people can do without. 

Would I like a new iPad? Yes. Do I need one? Definitely not.


They only tablets I see nowadays are iPads, Microsoft Surfaces, and the occasional Kindle.


Absolutely *nothing* in this article suggests the tablet market, overall, is "collapsing".   Android tablets aren't selling well but that's not surprising given Google isn't throwing a lot of attention towards that space.   
    
Apple's iPad sales are doing very well.


I wasn't really sold on tablets until Sidecar came along. Basically the main reason I own an iPad. I wouldn't even bother with a tablet that didn't have an equivalent feature.


The problem with the tablet market is the same problem Apple has; software.

For the vast majority a tablet is just a media consumption device, where’s the incentive to upgrade when a 5 year old device does the same job in that regard as a new one?

If they want to grow the tablet sector they need to grow the software to increase the use case, but that cannibalises their other product lines. 

For instance why does word have a cut down feature set in 2023?

Until they decide what they want tablets to be, new hardware upgrades wont help sell them.


From the article: Apple's iPad now commands half of the US tablet market, as it saw more than 20% growth in Q1 2023 year-over-year, while all other vendors declined.
Recently, Canalys claimed that Apple more than doubled its iPad sales in China in Q1 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Now the same research firm reports that US iPad sales in the same period were dramatically better than for any other tablet.

While noting that US desktop and laptop sales declined 28% in the same period, Canalys says tablet sales avoided a steep drop. "Tablets performed better, with shipments dropping just 7% to 10.8 million units," it says, "largely driven by Apple's strong iPad performance."

In Q1 2022, Apple shipped approximately 4.5 million iPads, while in Q1 2023, it shipped 5.4 million. That's an annual growth of 20.5%, and saw Apple's share of the market rise from 38.6% to 50%.


A market that has collapsed for other brands.


There was never a tablet market... There was just an ipad market.


I think the problem for iPads is the fact that they last forever. I know people that still have the 2018 iPad Pro that aren’t even tempted to get a new iPad because the one they have at work so damn good. It’s going to be six years old pretty soon. Sometimes it makes more sense to just get a battery replaced then get an entirely new iPad.


I really do believe tablets to be the future, long-term. For Gen Z, I can absolutely see the tech combo being:

* Smartphone as the primary personal computer
* iPad when a larger screen is required
* Work-issued laptop (for corporate jobs)


It is the tablet market.


Have any other tablets even been close to the amount of success?  

I feel like at one point Microsoft surface has hype but it was never that big and I haven’t heard a lot about them recently


I love my iPad and you wanna know the best part? They last forever! My old one is ten years old and my newer one is three and is a beast. You just don’t need to upgrade a tablet I mean at least for what I use it for


What a shit headline. Should read, non-iOS tablets losing, iOS tablets winning.  The market isn’t exactly collapsing unless you don’t count iOS.


I mean outside of a few niche use cases is there a reason to own a tablet anymore? I feel like its getting squeezed out of existence. Between phones getting bigger and more powerful and laptops getting lighter, more portable, and keeping a full OS on them why buy a tablet at all?


Not sure why anybody who owns a smartphone and a computer will need a tablet (ios or android) , outside of special cases ex. Drawing, hard justify the cost of owning a tablet.


I'm still rocking an iPad Pro from 2018 (the first model with USB-C, Apple Pencil 2, etc.) and see no reason to upgrade still. And once this thing finally dies, I'm not sure if I would replace it at this point - I feel like my use of my iPad has really stagnated and dropped off a cliff once I got my M1 MBP


Phones becoming so big eventually took sales of the tablet world


I've never really understood the use case for tablets. All the limitations of a phone with none of the benefits (it doesn't fit in my pocket). IMO you're much better off just going with a phone and a laptop.


I think the only way that the tablet market would “collapse” would be for a consumer standpoint. For point-of-sale and enterprise I think they are pretty much here to stay.

But I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Apple likes to talk out of both sides of their mouth with the iPad, but they don’t want to commit to giving it a proper interface or usability as a laptop replacement. 

Like yeah, they’ll come out with a $350 keyboard. Sure, they’ll get the gestures down and allow it to connect to a monitor , or use it as a Sidecar. And yeah, they might even come out with some pro applications. But their dedication to making the iPad “not a laptop“ complicates things especially when it’s priced just like a laptop.


Lots of comments here praising iPads as being the only viable tablet. Having used both an iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab S7+ (my current tablet), I can safely say that Samsung is miles ahead in multitasking and general capability. DeX is a game changer but even without that, the option to freely resize and drag windows is huge, and iPadOS lacks this basic feature.

 Sure, benchmark wise nothing in tablet space even comes close to M2 but everyone knows how limited iPads are by the software, and Samsung does not impose those limitations. Not to mention that the chips in S series Galaxy Tabs are fast enough for most use cases anyway.


Samsungs are decent, but software wise are a nightmare. Won’t even mention the Chinese ones. They’re just a less eco friendly way to burn money. Pixel C was decent. Pixel slate was an aberration. The most recent one looks promising, but Google will be playing catch up with even the basic iPad at double the price.


Meanwhile google is (hopefully) trying to get back into the tablet game.

My tab S8 ultra was the best tablet I've ever owned, and now that i have an S23U, galaxy watch and buds, I'll probably re-pick up an S9 ultra (though I do wish they'd make a mini tablet to compete with the ipad mini).

Hopefully google actually keeps their momentum for once and kits out android to play nicely with tablets. Apple had no competition and ipads grew insanely stale and boring. But then I use my S8 ultra and wonder why i ever used an ipad in the first place.


Pro Max size to rule them all!


I’ve got 3 iPads, I don’t need any more.


No surprise Apple owns the tablet market. Android tablets are absolute garbage. The Surfaces are super nice. I was considering one but the price is pretty steep so I got an iPad instead.


iPads are so far ahead of the rest of the industry

A notable example of this is just how much we argue about if an iPad can replace a laptop

That this is even a discussion is noteworthy. 

No one is making this argument regarding Samsung or Amazon tablets


Same thing for the watch market.


> propping up a collapsing tablet market

Yet another silly ridiculous title of weird distortions that become "normal" to people, which then goes on to inform more distorted phrasing in the future.

If person A is selling X, and person B is selling Y, and everybody is buying X, while nobody is selling Y, then you don't say "A is PROPPING UP the X+Y MARKET."  Just say A's products are selling and B's aren't.  They're propping up *themselves*, not an abstract market of irrelevant competitors.  Are they doing profit sharing?  Is this a club?

The idea of one "market" being "propped up" when it's multiple parties is some silly thing for investors who want to click a "Invest in TABLETS?" button, and journalists who want to harp on a conflation for the sole purpose of writing a shallow story about it, as if that abstraction is useful.  Normal intelligent people shouldn't be thinking that way.


I think tablets lost their appeal years ago. Apple products just sell because people will buy anything apple sells.


What’s a Google pixel C hahahaha


The problem with tablets is that people aren't willing to pay more than the cost of a phone for them but manufacturing them is often more expensive than making phones, thus making profit margins for tablets much tighter. 

Tablets are expensive devices that have more in common with laptops than phones from a BoM standpoint, simply by virtue of having more and bigger components inside, but consumers don't value tablets as much as phones or laptops.


I have a regular ipad and an ipad mini. The regular ipad is too big to use comfortable and requires some thumb gymnastics. The ipad mini is the perfect size but the size of text is smaller than my iphone. I think the next move to make is to get a Max phone.


The only android “tablets” i see regularly are the ones built into drone remotes


Collapsing market? Have you been to Chick-fil-A or any pop up business? They all use them.


Tablets have always been in the grey "why bother" area for me. 

It's feels like a less portable phone, or a terribly underpowered laptop. I guess if I had a kid, I might find a use for one.


Shows how much iPadOS matters. 

There are non-English speaking people who even call tablets an iPad too even if it’s not Apple. 😆


Collapsing???? Hahaha god Apple insider is desperate for views.


Probably because I don't have to worry about iOS / iPadOS not working on my tablet 4 years from now like you do with Android based products.

Current version of iPadOS which was just released will work on iPads made in 2017.


I always thought tablets just didn't fulfill much of a need for me. To big for a phone and not near as powerful or as nice as a laptop UX. At most, maybe watching a video or maybe a  pseudo kindle, but outside of maybe some work applications I just would rather use a laptop in most instances for the money or phone **for the price.** Especially when you look into what apple charges for a "magic keyboard." 

I've only considered an iPad strictly due to sidecar as a very accessible extra screen for something like a laptop. Maybe being lazy in bed, but I'm talking a no more than $250 iPad at max. I honestly just see it as a more portable monitor and even then there are now cheaper portable monitors out there. I would honestly probably prefer NReal glasses at this point. It's a complete luxury buy if anything to me. I would never buy one before already getting a smartphone and laptop. If work actually needed then work would need to provide me one then.


I love my iPad Pro and use it daily for personal use and work. However I’m still using a 1018 model and haven’t found a need to upgrade yet.


Just give on macOS on the iPad ffs. This has gone on for long enough.


Tablets have a lot of markets, but I no longer think it’s one of the products everyone needs, like a smartphone. Tablets are great for students, artists, and service/salespeople. It’s nice to have it if you’re not one of those, but it’s not really a big deal if you don’t.


I’m honestly surprised the iPads market share is only 50%


there isn't really any ecosystem outside apple for tablets.

samsung paid for clipstudio to come to android, and that was very smart, but there's few other big apps and samsung's tablets are not far off ipad prices so where's the incentive to look outside ios?


There’s some really well specced and well priced android tablets out there (Samsung, the new OnePlus model for example). The problem is that almost nobody is buying them. I’m curious how well the google tablet will sell when it comes out. Like you, I never see Android tablets in the wild. 

Generally speaking the iPad has the market on lock by a huge margin.


I think the numbers of tablets sold during pandemic changed the situation a bit, in many countries android tablets were bought by their people or the governments but now it is shrinking again.


> I don't see any for Android tablets anymore and haven't for quite some time.

I feel like this has been true for a decade already. Other than the handful of attempts Google made on their own, all Android tablets have been decidedly cheap and poorly optimized. As lacking as iPadOS is, Android on a tablet is somehow not any better.


On YouTube I see constantly ads for some (foldable?) Pixel tablet. But the ad costs are basically free for Google.


> I don't see any for Android tablets anymore and haven't for quite some time.

I mean, what's the compelling use case for Android tablets? Android doesn't really have a tablet-optimized flavor, and most apps don't have tablet-optimized versions. So Android tablets just act like supersized-screen phones, which if you already have an Android phone, isn't enough of an advantage.

Relatedly, I think that's why Amazon has such a strong showing in the remaining market; I suspect a large amount of Amazon's tablet sales are tablets destined for children who don't have their own phones.


Android tablets actually do sell in fairly alright numbers when you dont hyper focus on markets like the US. There are about 1 Galaxy series tablets sold for every 2 iPads for example, if I remember 2021 figures correctly. 

Despite that, the *market* is largely flat overall, and we're not seeing extensive growth, as the article discusses. https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/54684-110610-001-Canalys-iPad-US-sales-xl.jpg

People just aren't buying tablets in droves, and my personal opinion is that it has a lot to do with how niche tablet's value can be for many people. Unless you want a bigger multimedia screen or a drawing tablet, the iPad doesn't bring a lot to the table that a phone or laptop doesn't cover better.


There is no OS specific to android tablets and the apps are the same.  So many issues with orientation locks like the reddit app.  I tried to switch but just bought an iPad pro out of frustration.   What's nice about Android is multiple profiles so multiple family members can use the same ipad and I don't have to worry about 3 year randomly facetiming   people in my contacts trying to reach her grand parents.  Apple needs to add multiple profiles like what they have on MacOs.


[deleted]


People are still buying a lot of Android tablets. They just aren’t talking about it. They don’t have nearly the mindshare of Apple. 

We surveyed employees since we’re evaluating HR software and need to know if employees can run it. Shockingly I was the only one with an iPad, and mine is a 1st gen I think from 2011. Almost everyone else had an Android. I’ve can’t remember any of them mention having one.


economy or not, tablets on other Oses have always been a bust. There isn't an app ecosystem that's robust as the one on iPad Os. Most are just phone apps blown up.


iPads last forever. Mine is over 5 years old and still going strong


Apple is has run into the same problem with iPads and Macs now. Is the shiny new one nice? Yes. But if you have an 3 iPad or M series Mac, there is little reason for most users to upgrade. In fact, there is some degree of comfort if having a “workhorse” iPad that you can toss on the couch, drop occasionally, throw in a bag, use on a plane/bus…etc that you’ll lose if you get the new shiny.

I feel like the iPhone has only resisted the trend:

A) A lot of people break or lose their phone. They just get the new one.

B) Battery degradation occurs much quicker because constant use, smaller batteries, and a constant surge to charge when you can.

C) Apple has done a brilliant jobs convincing people a better camera is going to blown people away rather than teaching them to maximize the hardware they have.

D) Major Carriers still “subsidizes” upgrades to keep people from switching to dirt cheap MVNOs.


It absolutely depends. iPad has invaded into very unexpected areas where full computers used to dominate, notably front desk and service work.


Yep, I ended up selling my iPad for some extra cash because I couldn’t justify keeping it. Definitely not needed in most scenarios if you have a computer that you absolutely need that does everything you need it to do.

Loved having one but felt wrong keeping it when I am struggling a bit financially.


I have an iPad 12.9 from 2018. Been running great. And no problems. Would love to try the m2 out. But definitely no need for an upgrade.


At this point I don’t even desire a new iPad. My current one can do everything a newer one can do with a tiny less speed. It’s just not worth the upgrade anymore if you compare the generations.


The only tablets I see are Fire Tablet, iPads and Surface products, but that’s arguably closer to a laptop in terms of performance, power and use case. 

Considering whom I interact with fixed income older retirees LOVE their fire tablets. They are cheap and replaceable. Enough of a gateway to the web. Bigger than a phone and less inputs than a laptop.

I used to see iPads in nearly every restaurant or small business I visited to handle POS checkouts, but those are rapidly being phased out for what appears to be hardware from Square.

Do you count the 2 in 1 as tablets? That seems to be the way the non mac world went.


Technically, Google *is* throwing a lot of attention towards that space right now (over the last year or so), culminating in the launch of their first tablet in years and a foldable (which is basically a small tablet when unfolded). They've made several improvements to Android and updated many of their own apps to better support large displays.

So in the next few months after those devices go on sale around the end of June, we'll see how much that investment pays off for them.


>fox5atlanta.com/news/j...

I would say it's accurate that the "tablet" market is declining. The iPad market is doing fine.


[deleted]


Sidecar, Universal Control and Remote Desktop: ALL game-changers for using iPads now. Ideally Apple would all Parallels VM and run MacOS-Lite too...

Plus (at a pinch) many Web Services are changing the "landscape".


I tried it but the latency difference between the screens was annoying


Word being watered down for iPad is on Microsoft and not Apple


I’m surprised that it isn’t much higher than half the market.


When I travel for pleasure, I take just my phone and tablet. Haven't brought a laptop along since the iPad 2.

For business trips though, I do need my Mac.


I have two kids in elementary school who 100% prefer using their iPads over their Chromebooks for doing school work. 

It seems easier and faster for them to learn concepts by manipulating things on the screen with their fingers vs using a cursor and keyboard. There are also lessons that are timed and it’s faster to tap the screen vs moving the cursor to the answer. Sure, there are Chromebooks that have touch screens, but the Chromebooks in class don’t. 

I tend to view phones and tablets as the devices people like using and laptops as the device people use because they have to (for work or other tasks).


I’m gen Y, but haven’t owned a PC/Mac for a long time. I use phone and tablet for 99% of my personal stuff, and have a laptop for work which I can also use for the 1% of personal stuff not doable otherwise.

Still, laptops are not going anywhere, it’s just easier for work for most people.


That’s what i was thinking 🤣


iPad mini is basically an ebook reader (or maybe a small GPS/navigation device) which can also do every basic task a laptop can do and more.

I agree it's a niche product in a niche tablet market but honestly my iPad Mini is my favourite thing I ever bought from Apple.


There’s still uses for them.  The pro is a good size for drawing.  The mini is too big for a phone (unless foldable take off) and makes for a good light reader in size.  

The general iPad and Air size?  Lighter, easier to hold pencil and touch screen support are why I still have one.  All things that would become less important if Apple allowed touch and pencil support on the MacBook Air line.  Maybe making a hybrid machine where the MacBook’s “screen” is a detachable iPad.


iPads were huge for artists. Before iPads you had ridiculously expensive touchscreen drawing tablets that didn’t even operate independently most of the time. They still have their place in the industry but iPads were a cheaper, portable, and more powerful alternative. It’s a kind of a niche segment of the population, but then you also have the pilots that use the iPad mini, etc.

I just want them to stop expanding the device line and just combine the mac and iPad—they won’t do it because less money, but they better watch out because as soon as devices like the Surface Pro become competitive to both the mac and the iPad, people will start thinking more about their options.


The article states laptop and desktop sales declined at 4 times the rate of tablets.


I used to be a Mac user and switched to an iPad Pro as my main computer and I’m far happier with it. I find it much easier (and I believe I’m much faster) navigating an operating system using a touchscreen than using a keyboard and trackpad. It’s *painful* for me to use friends computers these days as I’m always touching the screen and there’s no feedback, and then having to use a trackpad just feel archaic. 

I also feel the iPad Pro genuinely has better hardware than Macs. A lot of people will downvote me for this but compare the displays side by side and an iPad Pro blows the latest MacBooks out of the water.

It’s also improving every year as a software platform and I genuinely believe it’ll be the main computing platform in the future. I’m just choosing to hop on the train a bit early.


I use it for apps, internet browsing, checking emails and watching movies

For business it is great for presentations and board meetings


I have an iPad mini for reading and travel.

It's the perfect size to use in bed, on a plane or on a bus.

Fits easily in a day bag.

Easy to run decent photo edits through Lightroom when away on holidays.


Nobody needs a tablet. But a lot of people use them all the time. I turn on my laptop maybe once every weeks, and my average screen time for my phone is around 45 minutes a day, but im on my iPad all the time. An average of 8-10 hours a day. It’s just a more convenient form factor


iPads are bigger than the iPhone and easier to travel with than the MacBook


Before I was gifted one I didn’t see the point either. Never imagined spending the money on it. But after I starting using it i fell in love! It works for me as a media consumption device.


It's a good conjecture. I think the use cases are:

* Desktop + iPad/iPhone
* Laptop + iPhone

So I already had a desktop and an old windows laptop. I got a Surface device because I wanted and needed touch/pen for work. After a few years I got rid of it and changed jobs but wanted an ultra-light-portable computer device with 2-in-1 functionality.

I went for a refurb iPad 11" and can use Remote Desktop to run a full computer on the go (which is at home). Then it is an excellent device for reading ebooks, web stuff  (most people use their phone but I hate using small screens like that) and also for other uses. Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and it's very light solution.

I used to think iPads were totally useless as you say but they ended up being the best 2-in-1 device on the market albeit Apple could do better and run VM MacOS on them too for native solution without internet.


> I think the only way that the tablet market would “collapse” would be for a consumer standpoint. 

It will CONVERGE into 2-in-1 market is where it's heading.


> Lots of comments here praising iPads as being the only viable tablet. Having used both an iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab S7+ (my current tablet), I can safely say that Samsung is miles ahead in multitasking and general capability. DeX is a game changer but even without that, the option to freely resize and drag windows is huge, and iPadOS lacks this basic feature.

Agree Samsung is equal with respect to quality of tablet experience more or less and provides DeX which is so much better than StageManager (deliberately over-engineered nonsense?).

With that said, I went for iPad: Paid a bit more for a refurb but the quality and OS will last for years and it can hook up with my other Apple devices nicely. I use Remote Desktop with the iPad so don't miss either DeX or Windows11 2-in-1 as I can use as a tablet then run a desktop inside the iPad as a solution. That said, do wish Apple would provide MacOS-Lite option natively with the iPad eg Parallels VM or some such...

Main advantage is Apple's ecosystem I think, once you are in it sucks you deeper in and you pay over the odds but you know it's quality and will last. Currently their iPhone, Macbooks are all top in class in those respective device ranges so the iPad just slots next to them.


LOL Google and hardware


I had a Surface X. Too heavy a laptop + touchscreen in effect. Go is too weak hardware wise but good size. iPad 11" plus Remote Desktop software = 2-in-1 with best quality hardware! Only thing is: You need internet connection to your home computer at one end and connection with your iPad at the other end.


>No one is making this argument regarding Samsung

Dex exists, and is a better experience than anything similar offered by Apple.

>A notable example of this is just how much we argue about if an iPad can replace a laptop

This is just marketing-speak, even phones today are powerful enough to handle scheduling and emails and smaller tasks of a similar nature. Anything more intense i.e. programming, compilation, editing etc. and the iPad doesn't even begin to replace a real computer and all because it's handicapped by the OS.


You could probably stand to stop telling people how to ‘correctly’ think about things. That’s really weird.


Yes, completely makes sense. People just buy things because it's Apple.


Even most iPad models are cheaper then iPhones.


Amazon keeps their Fire tablets around, but those are in a completely different class from iPads. Just so cheap they practically give them away.


Samsung's tablets are meant to keep Android phone users from buying an iPad. They have a much slower refresh cycle and they have pretty much given up on winning in the US.


The exception seems to be Meta and WhatsApp, they made WhatsApp available on Wear OS and Android tablets but nothing for iPads and Apple Watches.


> There’s some really well specced and well priced android tablets out there

The problem hasn’t been specs for quite a few years. It’s just the software that isn’t as well-suited for Tablets as iPadOS (I say this as an iPad user who frequently gets annoyed by iPadOS). 

Android tablets were just oversized phones with phone OS’s for so many years, that now even though Samsung and Oneplus have brought some features like the dock and multitasking to their tablets, the market has moved almost completely to iPads. 
Maybe in a few years we’ll see more big companies make full Android tablet version of their apps, like how they do for iPads (ex. Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, Procreate, DaVinci Resolve..).  But until that happens, they can make the specs as good as they want, it still won’t push people to buy them over an iPad.


Google tablet will not sell. It is the combination of smart speaker and tablet problems.


Samsung tablets seem to be doing decently well. They were in absolute chaos a while back but the current products are getting at on of polish and I see them being used a lot more often.


That’s marketed as a phone though not a tablet


A _lot_ of lower income Android households have tablets but no laptops. It serves the same purpose as the “family PC” of the 90s and 2000s.


[deleted]


The main use I see is parents that need a youtube/kids games tablet for kids when travelling or at the restaurant, but I agree with you that Amazon tablets are pretty hard to beat there


I mean, what exactly do most folks use tablets for though? Likely like a bigger screen smartphone to be honest. Watching vids and maybe reading a book. If it's for work then literally work would/should pay for it at that point then. 

I think for most, they likely use a tablet for the same types of things. I just think Apple does it better. Especially with integration, but to say they aren't liked bigger screened phones would be an odd take. They really are largely like that when you consider phones are honestly miniature computers these days. I think it's all in the UI. Android tablets just aren't as snappy or as well integrated as said before, but use case is honestly similar to a slightly more convenient smartphone due to screen size to be real.


I know I only buy when I have too. The iPad Air 2 I bought new years ago is still in service for me at work, though it could use a new battery.  The 11” Pro I bought 3 years ago as it’s replacement as my daily driver still performs way beyond my needs. I usually switch phones every couple of years but something like a tablet or even laptop/desktop will be kept to the end of its useful life.


Huge difference in average selling price between iPad and Samsung. Also most Samsung tabs being sold are the crappy tab E or tab A range that get bundled for free in carrier deals. This matters since those users are much less likely to spend $ on apps than iPad users leading to the terrible state of Android tablet apps today. In the past it was very easy to get samsungs flagship tabs for 300-400 brand new depending on storage size which is impossible for higher end ipads.


Piracy is really killing android. Google play store makes only half the revenue of the ios app store despite 3-4x more users. But with tablets ipads outnumber the entire Android tab market in the US and other countries so there's really no money in making android tablet apps


Ipads have more market share in the US than kindle fire and Samsung tablets combined. Also most Samsung tabs are crappy tab A or tab E that get bundled for free in carrier plans couple of my friends got one that way


I wonder if things like the ROG Ally will end up as the real competitors. Seem like they could be about as good as a tablet for portable media consumption, plus run a real OS at a similar price point. 

Sure there’s a battery tradeoff but I could see myself buying one instead of an iPad at least.


I remember buying a Samsung tablet back in the day, and it worked, but it was just Android with a different skin and it would run the batteries out in like a day.

I haven't really considered an Android tablet since.


[removed]


Isn't that what a tablet is though? Just a bigger phone screen really this day in age especially? Not sure a tablet is gonna be doing much a phone can't technically do already in MOST cases with likely very few exceptions. 

Things I can think of off the dome would be casual creatives with the pencil (which technically you can do on a phone, but again bigger screen with "blown up app" makes it more convenient), maybe some work stuff (which technically would likely be able to do on a phone, but again "blown up app" on bigger screen more convenient). You cna probably think of something of course, but being real, what most folks are using it for (i.e. watching videos and maybe doodling) it's a bigger smartphone use most of the time. 

The difference is more the feel of UI then anything alongside actual support and integration. Apple simply does it better imo. Use cases are honestly the same generally speaking. Execution is just different.


I really think it’s just a product with a very long upgrade cycle. I upgrade my phone annually but still using a 2018 iPad Pro. The Apple Watch is a similar device that’s worth using for 3 years at a minimum


I picked up an iPad Pro 2 used like 3 years ago. It’s 5 years old and still works perfectly for everything I use it for.


At this point my old ipads are really only limited by the app store not letting me download newer apps anymore.


My 1st and 2nd gen iPads are still working fine


Same with my 2018 iPad Pro. My brother gave it to me and the only problem it has is the occasional ghost touch. Can’t complain for free though.


[deleted]


You forgot E) a high end iPhone is a status symbol so people that both afford and can’t afford one are buying them.


I would upgrade my iPad if adobe put the ai noise reduction in Lightroom.   The funny thing is the Lightroom software for Mac is slightly more capable.  even though my iPad m1 is the faster M1 chip.  I much prefer the touch interface.  If they could only add the stuff I want.


B) also has much more of am impact on a phone than a tablet (if you’re not using the tablet as a work laptop replacement). If max battery capacity suddenly goes down to 70% on my iPad? Doubt I would notice. On the phone? I’d be eyeing an upgrade (or at least a battery replacement) right away.


iPads dominate the child market as well. One iPad can replace thousands in toys, expensive sport activities, and daycare!

But for real, iPads are amazing (in moderation) for children. Especially for the lower-middle class that can’t really afford childhood activities and don’t have family support.


> Pad has invaded into very unexpected areas where full computers used to dominate, notably front desk and service work.

I see iPads as the new register and kiosk in shops these days eg cafes or charity orgs (eg register yourself device etc) and so on. Feels like the space age!


Yeah, ironically in some serious literal professional use cases like that. But if you use that word then the 'pro' tech enthusiasts get really really angry.


I rarely use my iPad for the same tasks I use my MacBook for. I use mine daily for work and personal use


Okay, but I literally mean kindles.


Wel yeah, because they're their own thing. Kindles are still in production and new models coming out.


Fire what now ?


Yes, because I see a Microsoft Surface as a 2 in 1. Some of the Surfaces come with keyboards and some don’t but no one (that I’ve seen) uses a Microsoft Surface without a keyboard.


You couldn’t view YouTube community posts on iPads and Android tablets for over 5 years until they finally enabled the feature a few days ago…


Not in Q1 2023, which is the YoY comparison used for the article.


I never could get Universal Control to work, it seemed that the apps I tried didn't work with it.

The demo did looks slick though.


Yeah but unless Apple convince their software partners to develop full fat software for the platform the platform will always be a compromise and it’s growth will be inhibited. 

Apple have tried to protect the mac line up, specifically the MacBook Air from being cannibalised by the iPad. 

And even without the vendors, there’s no reason with the m1 and m2 iPads that macOS software shouldn’t be able to be loaded, the hardware is more than capable.

If they give the consumer the choice, they will see what people want out of their products.


Why doesn’t their iPad release of FCP support something as basic as external drive support?


Half is a ton considering their price. Ipads outsell fire and Samsung tabs combined - fire is basically disposable selling below cost and samsungs are mostly crappy tab A or tab E getting bundled for free in carrier deals


I do all of my work on an iPad Pro with a monitor and keyboard and while I could do the same stuff with something like a Mac Mini, I just don’t really like using desktop OSes anymore. The simpler interfaces of tablet apps is an upside to me, not a downside. 

There are small additional reasons for a tablet over a laptop as well. I do a lot of cycling workouts and use the iPad as the screen for the workout on my bike. I also use it to play games on the couch or use it to mirror games on my tv when playing a game that requires the camera (Starri, for example).


There are so many things you can’t do tho


sorta like the chrome os tablet I have that with a cheap keyboard/stand thing is effectively a 10" laptop?


Funny enough, googles first crack at tablets in a looong time has proper support for multiple users...something ipads still lack.

I don't care much if you're an isheep or an android drone, competition is good. There's a LOT of basic ass shit ipads can't do because apple refuses to add it, and there's a lot to be desired from android tablets because OEMs gave up on them once google stopped caring about the foundational software for android tablets.

If we see good android tablets, we see better ipads. If we see better ipads, maybe we'll see android try to one up them,  and so on.


Just having a competitor does “protect” the android system or folks will start wondering about moving.


I never understood why.  Surely watchOS and iPadOS are more lucrative markets for them, given how popular those platforms are compared to their Android counterparts.


Meta seems to hate the iPad, the fact that there *still* isn't a native Instagram app is so weird.


[deleted]


Agreed, and I don’t think the newer ones on the horizon solve that problem (speaking more about the Google tablet here).


>The problem hasn’t been specs for quite a few years. It’s just the software that isn’t as well-suited for Tablets as iPadOS (I say this as an iPad user who frequently gets annoyed by iPadOS). 

No, it's definitely the specs. iPadOS is truly iOS - a phone OS - with some extra features. iPad can't decide if it wants to be a big phone or a computer. iOS/iPadOS cripples it from utilizing the specs to the full power. Articles out in the past week have been about how iPads can't even export with Final Cut Pro in the background. That's...sad. Same app on a Mac could do it. But iPadOS isn't made for multitasking like a real computer. 

>Android tablets were just oversized phones with phone OS’s for so many years

Yes...but Android's "phone OS" has had PC comparable features for a looong time. You guys didn't even have a file browser until a few years ago. No file browser on a computer? That's utterly silly. Android has had a file browser since inception.

>that now even though Samsung and Oneplus have brought some features like the dock and multitasking to their tablets

What are you talking about? Not sure what you mean by "the dock." And multitasking is something iPads still can't do well. When iOS first introduced "multitasking," it literally just froze apps in the background when you switched instead of closing them. That's not multitasking. And iPads apparently still can't export movies using a movie editing app despite having an insane processor if you switch apps to get on Instagram. Apple sucks at true multitasking with iOS/iPadOS.

>the market has moved almost completely to iPads. Maybe in a few years we’ll see more big companies make full Android tablet version of their apps, like how they do for iPads (ex. Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, Procreate, DaVinci Resolve

Doubtful. No reason to make those apps for Android tablets when the processors aren't powerful enough to compete with iPads. Apple wins because their UI is simple and because their hardware is objectively better and more consistent on more individual points. I'm an Android fan, as my username implies, but it's undeniable that Apple is dominating everyone in processors. No one else can catch up, and no one quite frankly needs to because Snapdragon has a virtual monopoly and can afford to sit on their laurels.


It’s a tablet with a $129 speaker dock for charging in an always-on idle mode.

I hear Apple plans to do that idle mode with every phone and tablet in the future.


The Pixel Tablet is not marketed as a phone. The Pixel Fold might be what you’re thinking of, which is a phone


No, they just released a pixel tablet


Apparently, neither does almost everyone else


While this person you’re replying to is wrong, there is something to be said for the perception of android software optimization that they, and probably most people, still think that way. iPad apps since pretty early on have been distinct and usually make use of the screen size. Android was so late to doing that they’ll never quite catch up


Yes. Google has taken the last 12 months to finally update all of their default apps with a tablet interface that they just invented a year ago…. And they are doing each app one at a time, sometimes with a month gap in between.


Also a pretty good point. I'm planning on riding out my current tablet till 2028 or so as is, while I'd be more open to getting a new phone if there's enough improvement.


There's too many tradeoffs to make that feasible. The battery life is not just a little worse, it's a league below tablets. Or iPads, anyway. They're also very heavy for their screen dimension and more bulky because of the included controls. They *have* to have relatively bad, low resolution displays because otherwise the poor battery life degrades even further. 

> plus run a real OS at a similar price point

This is not as much of an upside as you might think. The ROG Ally just running Windows rather than SteamOS has such a performance impact that it significantly cuts into the already limited battery life.

I have a Steam Deck and like it a lot but it's no good as a tablet. Using desktop Linux with the trackpads does work pretty well and is kinda fun but I would never prefer it over my iPad long term. 

You can criticise Apple for some of the decisions they've made for the iPad over the years but they're absolutely right in being cautious with how they introduce "desktop features" on a touch tablet device. Adding pro features is good but it's no use if you end up degrading the general experience to the point people give up and just go back to using a regular laptop anyway.


I have no idea how your point correlates to mine?


> Isn't that what a tablet is though? Just a bigger phone screen really this day in age especially?

Phones (barring foldables) are all roughly the same size. That means they're all generally fine using the apps designed for that sort of screen. When you have a screen that is five times larger than a phone, that app design is no longer acceptable. What's the point of having a larger display when the apps running on it just show the same content but with 80% more blank space?


I still got my iPad Air 2, working just fine. Still got updates until recently. Not anymore, sadly, but I can live with that. Perfect device for Netflix and some basic browsing, which is really all I'd ever use it for anyway. By the way, it's the white version, the original with the laminated display, and still looks great, despite being 8 years old.


Only for two gens so far. And really it's the Macbooks that are now running on modified iPhone/iPad hardware.


iPhones aren’t a status symbol especially in America where many people regardless of financial status get the phones with installment payments. I live in Nyc and see wealthy and working class people all using the same phones. Having an iPhone was only a big deal the first few models.


[deleted]


Yup many restaurant front desks use them and nearly every food truck uses them for payment.


There’s cheap iPads for cases where it’s literally a cashier station, there’s also expensive iPad for tech use. I think it’s the pro area is where Apple just don’t want to or has trouble leaping into a laptop-tablet combo which everyone expects them to do.

I think that the iPad is genuinely amazing in tasks that is well sandboxed like writing and front desk work. Conversely, Apple should consider unchaining the MacBook from the laptop form factor into something more like a tablet.


I used mine daily for work and personal use too, just nothing that I couldn't do on my laptop or phone too.. Trust me, I know it is useful and extremely convenient for a lot of things, just couldn't justify it at this point in my life unfortunately.

I hope to get in a better place to have an iPad again at some point though.

Yeah their recent focus on larger screens doesn't excuse years of not focusing on them, but better late than never.


* Universal Control
* SideCar

They're all useful variously and nicely integrated. My iPad is mainly for second screen and for writing on in addition to my MBA which also uses an external large monitor.

Then out and about: iPad to Remote Desktop into MBA.

Personally I really think Apple should have just come out with their own proprietary RDS solution for this again to make it as seamless as possible. But the wealth of current solutions all work fine as it is.


I actually have had iPads as my main computer for years, but I tried a MacBook Air just because I felt like I must be missing out on some thing. Ended up hating it. It felt antiquated and old and I ended up going back to having an iPad Pro as my main computer. And also the fact that I can just hook it up to an external monitor and keyboard, whenever I want it, big makes it my ideal workstation.


I literally built a business from scratch that’s turned over millions of dollars, all on an iPad. What am I possibly missing out on not being able to do?


Surface Pros are effectively laptops with touchscreen ie can be used like tablet.

iPads are tablets with laptop hardware.

Eventually convergence will mean light/thin form factor will have equivalence across hardware of tablet and laptop. Ergonomics will then be very important ie iPad form factor will double as laptop.


Even with iPadOS 16.4 supporting web notifications, WhatsApp Web notifications don’t work properly. The badge count appears when launching the PWA added to Home Screen, but it doesn’t send any notifications.


that one kind of makes sense because Meta wants people posting more not just viewing and tabs are used much less for posting than phones. sucks balls for us users though


Notifications don’t work despite iPadOS 16.4 supporting it. Only badge count updates upon launch.


> Yes...but Android's "phone OS" has had PC comparable features for a looong time. 

People don't look for root access in a file browser or whatever other poweruser features, they're looking for an OS designed for a tablet.

When someone says Android tablets are just stretched phones, they don't mean that they're missing PC features. They mean that Android tablets are missing *tablet* features. They mean that they open an app and it's just the phone version of the app with 80% more blank space on one side.

Having poweruser features is nice, but having sensible tablet features is essential.

> What are you talking about? Not sure what you mean by "the dock."

This is one of those features you need for a good tablet experience. "The dock" is just a dock of apps, same as macOS or now Windows 11, that you can invoke by swiping up from the bottom. It lets you open apps without first closing out of whatever you're currently doing.

> And multitasking is something iPads still can't do well.

iPads can absolutely multitask well. They've had split view and slide over for years, which was a "sorta good enough" solution, and now have an actual window manager. It's not 100% as good as regular multitasking on a PC/Mac, but it's pretty good considering the limitations of being a touch device with a small screen.

> When iOS first introduced "multitasking," it literally just froze apps in the background when you switched instead of closing them. That's not multitasking.

I don't even remember if this was true but in any case, you're talking about something that happened 13 (?) years ago. You're not gonna convince people to get an Android tablet in 2023 by saying Apple fucked up some phone feature in 2010.


> No, it's definitely the specs. 

No. Most people won’t notice the difference between an M2 and a Snapdragon (whatever the new chip is called)
By most people I mean everyone who isn’t editing 4K movies or big RAW photos on their tablet.


> iPadOS is truly iOS - a phone OS - with some extra features.

Yes and no. It’s much improved for multitasking over iOS and older versions of iPadOS, but it still has a lot to improve on

> iOS/iPadOS cripples it from utilizing the specs to the full power.

This is true. Many hoped that at least with M1 we’d get more proper features than we did..

> Yes...but Android's "phone OS" has had PC comparable features for a looong time. 

Android tablets have some features iPads *didn’t* but there aren’t many it still lacks (though there are still some. But the MS Office android tablet apps pale in comparison to their iPad versions, the same goes for my aforementioned Lightroom and DaVinci. 


> No file browser on a computer? That's utterly silly. Android has had a file browser since inception.

Yes, that was stupid. But at least now it has it.

> What are you talking about? Not sure what you mean by "the dock." 

The new Samsung tablets and foldables, as well as some android tablets like the OnePlus, have a dock of apps to quickly switch between/use multitasking. 

https://i.imgur.com/XOt3XNG.png

> And multitasking is something iPads still can't do well. 

But they’re gestures to initiate it are much more intuitive to the user than Android’s, which is what matters to less savvy users.

> And iPads apparently still can't export movies using a movie editing app despite having an insane processor

This is something they will hopefully work on..

> No reason to make those apps for Android tablets when the processors aren't powerful enough to compete with iPads. 

No. If many of the iPad-specific apps run fine on an iPad from 2017 (that’s 6 years ago), it’s not the hardware that’s lacking.

> Apple wins because their UI is simple and because their hardware is objectively better and more consistent on more individual points

Their UI is simple. But there’s also the fact that the apps people with use on it actually feel like they’re made *for* the iPad, not scaled up phone versions.

> No one else can catch up, and no one quite frankly needs to because Snapdragon has a virtual monopoly and can afford to sit on their laurels.

Once again, it’s not the performance, it’s the software. Don’t blame Qualcomm (the company who makes Snapdragon chips), blame the app devs for not making android versions. Or better yet, blame the people who own these apps for not letting the devs make them.


At least the dock is included with the tablet

But why is the dock limited to only being able to use the speaker when the tablet is connected?

Make it a smart speaker otherwise….so dumb of google

Most people don’t need a high end computer since they aren’t nerds. iPads are way better alternative.


Well, that’s because the iPhone is quite mundane in America, but in my country, which is not that rich, it is something to buy to make people notice you.


I do wish for a Mac tablet if for nothing else so that people who don't use iPads can shut up about Apple needing to destroy everything great about the iPad. But jokes aside I think we are rapidly approaching territory of laptops and tablets being very very distinct again as almost every hybrid device on the market fails to grab a niche.


Technically neither are Microsoft Surfaces.


What makes a device a tablet or not a tablet?


Well, in my field of work, most of it you can’t do. 

No complete photoshop. No illustrator. No InDesign!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So yeah, it’s seriously limited for some use case


While I don’t doubt that many people can get by with an iPad as their primary computer, there are certain things it can’t do and not all apps needed for business support it.

>iPads can absolutely multitask well. They've had split view and slide over for years, which was a "sorta good enough" solution, and now have an actual window manager. It's not 100% as good as regular multitasking on a PC/Mac, but it's pretty good considering the limitations of being a touch device with a small screen.
>

[You conveniently ignore the fact that iPadOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/13spnme/final_cut_pro_for_ipados_cant_export_in_the) *can't export videos in the background despite having the exact same overpowered CPU/GPU as a Mac.* (Comments also talk about how bad even basic file management is on iPadOS, which again, Android has had since day 1.)

Any device that can show two apps side by side can do so acceptably well. **Multitasking** is being able to do tasks in the background as well so when you switch to another app, your active app doesn't shut down. iPadOS still fails at that. 

>I don't even remember if this was true but in any case, you're talking about something that happened 13 (?) years ago. You're not gonna convince people to get an Android tablet in 2023 by saying Apple fucked up some phone feature in 2010. 

I'm not trying to convince anyone to get an Android tablet. iPads are great for many people. You missed my point because you were so focused on (poorly) defending a platform that is crippled by its own software and can't multitask well. **My point is that Android won't be getting iPad-level pro apps anytime soon because the hardware doesn't support it.** iPads can't multitask well but they can still export a video way faster than any Android chip on the market. THAT is why Android tablets won't get pro apps like that (plus the tiny market share, obviously).


Still tho


Doesn't help that the majority of Android tablets are junk, budget devices or Fire tablets.


The android app situation is still pretty terrible. Lot of games use crappy old drivers that make it look like a blurry blown up phone game or others like onenote or Adobe suite are way better on ipad. Keep in mind ipads still have more market share in the US than Samsung and Kindle fire tabs combined with a much higher average selling price. I doubt this situation will ever improve since even the iPad market isn't that big for apple


Androids biggest problem with tablets is that it’s not just a “and this is what goes on the left side if it’s a tablet, using the built in layout system” design system, which is what apple has.

With almost no work, any iPad developer can make a half decent app using the built-in layout tools and icons. Dark mode and tablet mode are part of the package and have to be specifically excluded via custom layout to not get them.


> most of the models sold are garbage budget devices

Samsung probably put out a $1200 tablet for this reason, more of a statement piece than an actual volume mover (though apparently it sold out?)


Laptops have a ton of advantages iPad does not that tons of folks can and do use. Literally just the OS itself is trash in comparison to other OS's even for some of the most basic office tasks in the world. Who tf wouldn't prefer mac OS and/or windows or hell even Linux in many environments to a tablet for doing many common work activities? Almost no one really. 

The IO is SUPER limited, UX is trash by comparison, lack of support for many things, and shitty keyboard compared to alternatives by far. Just a Ipad and a magic keyboard alone is easily $800 dollars and that's with the nicest keyboard it has to offer that is completely shitty in comparison to an M1 that you can already get for $800 that is better in just about every way imaginable. Hell, you only get 64GB of storage with that iPad btw and forget about performance and longevity compared to the laptop. 

You have some huge insecurities as well and it shows. Hell, there are laptops that cheaper than iPad even if you really want to go whatever route really and more capable, but hey, I don't need to go into it as I've already said enough to show you're out of touch to be real.

I’ve reviewed, edited, and even created from scratch several design documents using the incredible Affinity suite on iPad for the business. We’ve put together merchandise proofs, printed full page magazine ads, drafted a website, and even gigantic multi-GB files for huge signage artwork. On my iPad.

It’s irrelevant to me that I don’t have “full photoshop or indesign”, as I have alternatives that support those file formats, with comparable feature sets (and in some cases better than Adobe suite.)

You just need to reevaluate what you think iPads can’t do.


It's the same for iMessage or Signal


I agree that Apple needs to seriously work on some things like the File manager, but also agree with the above commenter that a lot of androids power features are simply unused by most and what matters more is the basic design of the apps that run on it.

> My point is that Android won't be getting iPad-level pro apps anytime soon because the hardware doesn't support it

Is MS Word a “pro app” to you that requires an M1 chip? Or Lightroom, which runs on a 2017 iPad?
These are apps which users will want to use, and are lacking quite a lot in comparison to their iPad versions. It’s not performance, it’s bad apps.


> You conveniently ignore

I ignored it because I haven't looked into the specifics, nor do I care about some weakness of this 1.0 version of an app I don't use.

> Any device that can show two apps side by side can do so acceptably well. Multitasking is being able to do tasks in the background as well so when you switch to another app, your active app doesn't shut down. iPadOS still fails at that.

1. That's a completely arbitrary definition

2. iPadOS currently allows you to keep up to 8 windows/apps open at the same time, 9 if you count an additional PiP video playing on top, as well as whatever usual processes and background refresh actions are going on. All of these are considered "active" and you can switch between them (bring to the foreground) at any time while the others keep doing what they're doing. This is why I ignored the Final Cut Pro export topic as I don't know whether or not FCP has some unique issue due to being a demanding first party app and can't be used in this manner.

This functionality is objectively superior to multitasking on Android. It's also not like the apps get immediately nuked the moment they disappear from the active screen. I can use an app, minimize it, pull it back up and it will behave just like an application would on my desktop computer. The only appreciable difference I have experienced is that VLC's web server will shut down soon after you minimize the app. There may be other limitations but they just aren't a factor in the actual use of the device so I never noticed them.

> My point is that Android won't be getting iPad-level pro apps anytime soon because the hardware doesn't support it.

And your point is dead wrong. Photoshop was released when the most powerful iPad had an A12X chip. Android tablets match or outperform that chip today, yet there remains no Photoshop app on Android. Keep in mind that that particular iPad was by no means a minimum requirement and Photoshop supports much older and weaker iPads as well.

There is no support for Android tablets because Android on tablets fucking sucks and nobody wants to use it, that's all there is to it. Nobody cares about messing around in the root directory with the most clunky file browser in the world, they just want a user interface that is convenient to use and is actually made for the size screen they're using it on.


Yet they still sell…


So where does the kindle scribe fall? It does more than only allow a person to read books.


Yeah but those software aren’t used in design firms or Fortune 500 entreprises. 

I’m sorry. Industry standards are where it’s at.


Laptops sell way more bud. Not even close by comparison which is the point lmao.


Still not a tablet, you're not consuming media on it aside from written text because it's the only thing it is good at. It just so happens you can write on it as well. There are some e-readers that come with a full Android OS on it but they're still just fancy e-readers.

4th gen ipad to save you a click


To clear up a little confusion in this thread; being obsolete doesn’t mean that Apple have just now stopped offering OS updates, it means that they no longer support the device at all. In almost every case of a device being made obsolete, it’s stopped getting OS updates years before. With this iPad, it’s last OS update was in 2019, but that was an unusual case where a security hole was filled on the cellular model. The wifi only model hasn’t been updated since 2016.

What this does mean is that if you have an iPad 4 with a broken screen, Apple will not replace it for any money. You can still get the work done by an indie, of course, but Apple themselves will no longer touch it.


"Obsoletes" = "Will No Longer Update the OS" ≠ "Will No Longer Work"


This sucks, I have 2 of these that work flawlessly…
On another note, anyone interested in purchasing some vintage tech?


I have an iPad 2 that hasn’t had a software update since 2016, but it still works great for my kid. She can play her educational games (she’s not quite 6) and watch movies on the Videos app, Netflix, Amazon, etc. It has a 30 pin connector. It holds a charge for like a week! You can pry that thing out of my cold dead hands!


TIL "obsolete" is considered a verb by some people


Apple should provide an official way to jailbreak an unsupported devices. I would like to install some Linux and use my as a wall panel for Home Assistant.

Just an opinion.


Stupid title award 🥇


That's a solid 10 year run. Kudos to Apple for supporting it for that long.


Guess my iPad Air is up next


When did obsolete become a verb?


We are still actively using an iPhone 4 for games and podcasts. Just because Apple's no longer supporting something doesn't mean it can't continue to be useful.


What about my first iPad with a 30pin!? /s


Lot of whining here about, well, pretty much the ONLY company that keeps support for it's products past 2-3 years from public release.  

Show me an Android device from 2012 that's still supported.


If you're into music creation at all, out even just like messing around, the Moog software was written for the original iPad and still works great as a customizable, touchscreen synth for your old devices.


[deleted]


Thats pretty long, Oculus headsets get unexisted after 2 years.


iPads are fucking tanks and I'm not sure why. I have an Air 2 and there's zero reason to upgrade it. The thing is from like 2016.


I mean, that model is almost 10 years old.

So, yah, not surprising.


Please stop making words that are not verbs verbs.


Good. Please stop updating my poor ipad 1. It’s trying its best.


I remember buying “the new iPad” in 2012.


I still have a working 1st Gen iPad. Probably should upgrade at some point.


Oh no they are going to come for my 1st gen air aren't they? i love that thing, there is nothing wrong with it even now.


I still use my 3rd gen ipad (daughter uses for facetiming while gaming) and 4th gen ipad (use a remote control app for Pro Tools) and they work great. 

For now.


My kids are still rocking Gen 2 with the 30 pin connector. iOS 9 I think.


Currently on an iPad Air 2.


I hadn't been paying attention, but it just feels bizarre to me that we're 4 generations into obsolete iPads. It feels like it wasn't that long ago the first one released. I remember an article about someone who lost part of their hand getting mugged for their first gen iPad walking it out of the apple store, and it stuck with me that he lamented about being permanently disabled for a computer that will be worthless in a few years.


I wish they offered a way to load a different OS when a device become obsolete. Instead of making an expensive paper weight.


I don't think obsolete is a verb.


Laughs on ipad 3 with half a broken screen..


*Obviates,* not "obsoletes."


I have an iPad 4 and literally from one day to the next it suddenly didn't support the YouTube app😔


Having had my Mac Pro replaced cause it just fried itself 2 weeks after purchase- a year later it blitzed and needed major surgery. Apple is getting pricey for products that aren’t always that great.


Say all you want about apple, but hardware and software wise they support their shit for as long as they can. It might slow your phone down but the iPhone 6 still gets updates


This kind of news hurts iPad owners because those old iPads are still useful. I remember back when a computer would be obsolete after a few years. Phones were such crap that you might upgrade every year. But man, Apple sure knows how to make an iPad. We use our old iPads as video players. You can load them up with old games for little kids. I have also used them as second screens for my work laptop. I’ve always wanted to load one up with recipes and mount it in the kitchen.


ITT: Android users getting confused about the definition of Obsolete


Bro I have an iPhone 8 and it works flawlessly it’s starting to freak me out about the 6 is obsolete. I don’t want a new phone this phone works fine it has a good camera it’s fast please don’t make me get a new phone Apple


I pulled out my OG iPad the other day after years of dormancy and the screen literally peeled off lol


Macrumors turns noun into verb.


It’s been obsolete for years. The last update was 10.3.
  
Fun fact though: the App Store still works and you can download previous versions of apps that are compatible with that version.
  
I have an iPad mini first gen and iPad 2 (and iPhone 4s) that I still use regularly for
Music production as dedicated devices. They’re just as miraculous as the day they came out to me.


Now if you could just obsolete the lightning connector...


Apple terms of Vintage is SEVEN years and Obsolete is NINE years. This applies to computers and i-devices.

I have an iPad Air that was three years old, and one month past Applecare+ warranty. It stopped charging. The power management chip failed and would cost $300 to repair, or send it out to a 3rd party for $250 repair + sh. It was $349 to replace with newer model (still working). I swear Apple knew of this power management chip issue but no recall ever occurred. 

 I seem to be accumulating Apple junk... (dead iPad, dead iPods, dead iphones, dead iMac, dead MacbookAir, dead macbook (white), dead G4 and G5 Macpro... )..


I found my IPad 2nd gen the other day and let me say, it can’t run shit


Obligatory “Fuck Apple” and planned obsolescence cries from the Android fanbase.


Apple needlessly cuts off updates on another ipad generation. Choosing to put profits before the planet and its customers. Blocking customers from the next security updates, in an effort to drive new sales, but ultimately delivering unnecessary waste.


Does that just mean it may not sync up?


Does this mean that it won’t be usable anymore? Because I have some old angry bird games on that thing


My iPad still works, but Apple have forced it to become obsolete as it does not support an iOS above 10.3. Yay. Build long lasting hardware and software it to the ground. Good job.


Is this why my iPad won’t connect to my iPhone hotspot anymore?


All their iPads with lightning are obsolete.


It should be criminal.  I have two pads that I have had for years.  Both in otter boxes and both only used for a single app that only works on IOS.  


Fuck Apple as I am going to be forced to buy a new one basically against my will.


Is that why mine is crawling now?  I erased it clean and it still sucks.


Man I’m glad I just sold my iPhone 6s last week


Yay! Planned obsolesce, truly the American way.


I use an iPod touch 6 as my daily driver because I won’t pay for a cell phone, finally have my 7 on the way today and am excited to update to iOS 13, 14, and 15 finally hahaha!


This planned obsolescence is such an awful waste of resources.

I could be wrong, but wasn't Apple a major fault for the current, particular hardware shortage?
(I may be mistaken)


Thats crApple for ya


My Ipad 1 is in perfect condition and hasnt been usable in years. I hate you apple


Majority of the ones I come across at work have swollen batteries at this point.


Apple literally plans the obsolescence of their devices and people still choose to buy them. Fucking wild


Is obsolete a verb now?


Wow


I'm browsing this post on an iPhone 5c right now


My 16gb iPad became obsolete years ago when the updates became larger than the available ssd space. Even if I deleted everything on it, I still couldn’t download the updates if I wanted to.


We can install Linux on it now right—right?


The iPad was a bit of a stumble


It wouldn't be so bad if you could update the browser independently from the OS.


This happened a wile ago my mom gave me her old iPad a couple month ago the only app I could get working on it was Reddit


My 2nd gen iPad is still rockin with a 12-year-old OS.


My first iPad. Also my first lightning connector.


How do I even check what model mine is?


How do I tell which iPad I have?


Sadge


Are  
lou


I’m fucked


Wait so my I pad with 30 pin is no Bueno


I am still using the 1st gen iPad Pro and it has a lightning connector, as does my iPhone 11 - so what does that mean?

Can someone explain (except the author of that “article”, because I’m already confused and I don’t need more confusion thnx)


Bastards!


You’ll find the iPad’s body floating in the East River tomorrow morning


My mother still uses an original iPad 1 with the big connector.  I still have my iPad 2 with the big connector because I'm too cheap to buy a lighting cable for my old guitar interface (or a new interface altogether).


Oh shit, I have that one


What about 3rd gen ipad mini


Proud to say I'm typing this from a 2009 MacBook.


I have a 2nd generation still going strong. I’m good til they change the charger on iPhones. That should buy me, what, 2 weeks? LOL


i have a first generation ipad pro that works like a charm and i’ll use it til it dies


Uh, my IPad mini 2 hasn’t been able to recieve iOS updates for a long time.


I’ve got a IPhone 8. Can I make it to obsolete status?! Challenge accepted!


And should obsolete the last iPad with USB lightning and should only put headphone jacks on iPhones and iPads


Cool now do the rest of lightning.


Well that's me, fuck


Cannot confirm. I need to update safari, but I can no longer update iOS to support the update.


I repurposed my one click saved to upvote you.


I have a first gen air and it still works incredibly. I’ve had my iPhone X that I got 2 years ago crash apps, but have never had any freezing up on iPad. It’s not networked connected


This needs to be the top comment. I used to work in the Apple store and this is all it means. A product becomes obsolete 5 years after the latest product was sold new. Apple doesn’t service the hardware on obsolete parts. For an iPad this doesn’t mean much because servicing its hardware means a full unit replacement anyways. 

I think this is news only because of how long this iPad was being sold in stores. Means some units had been sold as late as 2017.


Most Apple stores actually don’t replace iPad screens. They like to tell customers that they are not replaceable

Source: own a repair shop, get customers in who took their iPads to Apple first who let me know


No, the wifi-only model received its last update before iOS 11 in 2017.


It will still get Bugfix updates, just not feature updates.


I haven’t been able to update mine in months


I have a iPad2 is great to read comics on the bed, have been 4/5 years since last update, i cant use web anymore but the manga/cómic app is stil working. This infurate me, ill need to trow away a hardware working because the soft is no more updated so wont work anymore with modern codec/protocolls


Depends on what you need on the tablet. In the past older versions have become unusable with latest apps like YouTube no longer working.


Let's not forget that most iPhones get > 5 years of OS and security updates.


Actually I believe for Apple obsolete means they won’t repair the hardware. They already stopped software updates.


I’ve got a Mini 2 and it won’t update past os12, but I still use it daily. Just depends on what you need to do.


I’m surprised it was supported this long


The OS on that one hasn’t had an update since iOS 9. But the fact that, until yesterday, you could take your ten year old iPad into an Apple store and have them repair it is pretty impressive.


Verbing weirds language


That’s usually the same thing. An app will update and then no longer be usable. And you can’t downgrade the app yourself, ridiculously.


You might be able to sell them on ebay. Especially right now cause people are buying them up to trade in to samsung for their s22 series phones. I just bought an s22 ultra and it let me trade in one of the first ipads with the 32 point connector for $120. One thing you might do is go on samsungs site buy an s22 trade in both the ipads "they let you trade 2 for one" then just sell the s22 online. Might be able to make some cash that way.


They still work the same. It's just that an Apple shop won't repair it.


I'll give you about €3.50


I had the same for my kids, but found that newer apps just weren’t coming out anymore - Disney+, then Netflix dropped off, Plex still worked though. 

I ended up selling the old iPads for about AUD $100 each and picking up new ones for AUD $200 each (32GB Gen 6 models), and honestly they are so much better - the screen time options are worth it alone, and so much faster etc.

32GB does push things a bit so bigger storage would be handy, but they really have been great.


> You can pry that thing out of my cold dead hands!

Does your kid knows about your hands temperature? This sounds worrying.


Usually we would say “to make obsolete”.

Why use many word when few word do trick?


I lol'ed at the headline too


You're probably able to jailbreak your old iPad. Check r/jailbreak for compatible device/OS version numbers.


Not that easy for them to do. All ARM devices are tightly integrated devices, it's not a question of just installing any Linux variant on the device that you want like you could with x86. 

In the ARM world, Linux has to literally be built for that specific ARM device. There are technical reasons that drive this, essentially the OS has to be built with the device drivers built into it and to put that OS on another device you literally have to rebuild the OS with new drivers. This is why Android devices have such an abysmal support cycle. Qualcomm stops support for their SoC on a fixed schedule which forces manufacturers to drop support on Qualcomm's terms. It's not impossible for them to continue without Qualcomm's support, but it's expensive as hell. There's a reason why not even Google can break that support cycle with their Pixel phones. The only company that has bothered with the investment is Fairphone and they spent all their resources on reverse engineering drivers for an old Qualcomm SoC. They would need to repeat the exercise for more modern Qualcomm SoCs if they want to do it again.

People love to say that the only reason ARM devices doesn't exist with x86-like OS support because of corporate greed. The reality is very different, the tightly integrated nature of ARM makes it impossible to have the type of OS and driver support x86 enjoys. That tightly integrated nature is also what allows ARM to be such a good choice for mobile devices and lower power consumption. Adding the same layer x86 has for SoC interoperability will harm ARM's power efficiency advantage.

Apple still uses ARM and is subject to the same restrictions. Which means to support what you are proposing, they would have to release the source code for the drivers of their devices. This is unlikely for them to do because most of the time Apple doesn't own all of the code in these drivers (legally not allowed to release it) and releasing them publicly poses a risk of Apple releasing proprietary information.


Absolutely. The idea the devices we own should become e-waste the second the manufacturer decides to stop supporting it is super dumb. Allow users with expertise to support their own devices and keep them out of the landfill!


You want them to officially provide a way to break the device’s security.


That's beyond idealistic - bordering on naive, honestly. Not that I wouldn't love to see companies do this, but there really is no sensible motivation for Apple to go this route.


[deleted]


But that would mean you'd get more use out of your old device and would therefore be less likely to buy a new one. Also they wouldn't make profit out of it. I hate Apple but I understand why they don't do things like this. Their choices are transparently motivated by profit.


Yeah provide a method to break their devices

&#x200B;

write that down, write that down


Yeah this is framed negatively but like at some point it doesnt make sense in any way to continue support no matter how many people have held out on them. If youre surprised and angry if thats you then you really were never apple’s target audience anyway


[deleted]


10 years is insane! Android tablets are extremely lucky to even get 3 years of support. If I ever upgrade my tablet it will be an apple, the longevity is insane


USB-micro B would like a word. It's still supported 20 years in.


I still rocked my 1st gen Air until just over a year ago when I got my 7th gen. That thing was amazing, but really got to the point where a good chunk of the software I wanted to use wouldn’t work on iOS 12.

About 150,000 years ago when language became the arbitrary and malleable convention system that it is.


A long time ago? It’s in the dictionary, pretty sure it’s not a recent addition


Exactly.  This fact seems to escape every Android user every time it comes up.


yeah... I was asking another commenter here to produce evidence of any non-Apple tablet from 10 years ago that still was in use or worked.


I think I read the performance actually increased with the latest OS being more optimised than the previous. They slow down when the battery life is poor, but a battery is a consumable part of a phone in my opinion...


The slowdown also isn’t anywhere near as bad as with Android phones. I still have an iPhone 3GS that runs perfectly fine, aside from the battery being a little bit tired. The same thing can’t be said for the significantly newer Samsung Galaxy S3. 

An Ericsson Xperia X10 mini from earlier won’t even open many websites, since the cert database hasn’t been updated since 2015 - mere 5 years after it came out. 

Apple does a lot of shady things. Refusing to support their products is not one of those.


They just think it means after three updates or 18 months, whichever comes first.


You are still good for at least two years. First the 6S gets obsolete than the 7. But even if the Phone becomes obsolete you can still use it.


I have an iPad 2 and can’t get apps anymore since it got master reseted. No apps on the App Store will work on it. It’s basically useless


You can download apps if the developer is still releasing backwards-compatible updates.

Pretty sure you can't download most apps like Youtube and Netflix on devices that old.


…and replace it with something standard like USB-C


Which iPods do you have? Because if they’re Classics/Minis, then it’s entirely possible that you can repair them and sell them on. It’s quite easy to do.


Yeah, 10-year planned iPad obsolescence!  
Those dirty rascals!


It released 9 years ago. It’s the last curve-back iPad, so the number of surplus parts available and the number of remaining users can’t be very high these days.


How long should a company be expected to keep supporting their old products? These things change… you should think of doing that too.


No, Will Sync but the new soft wont install and the old software little a little Will be unusable. I have a iPad 2 that i can Sync with iTunes but cant install anything new and Pray to the updates of my few working app dont break.


It means they won't update the OS anymore


Remains usable, no new OS updates.

Might do emergency updates for vulnerabilities, but that’s it.


The costs behind supporting old hardware is tremendous


Probably down to the protocols used being too modern for it.


How so?


Your old iPads will still work. They just won’t get updates anymore. You should back up the apps on your desktop or laptop if you have one. Old apps might not be available for download.


Nah, it’ll be simply because it’s old, and what apps can still run on it will have been compiled for a newer version at this point, so it doesn’t really have the grunt to run them anymore. iOS famously reduces processing power to preserve the battery, so if it has an original battery then that may be throttling it.


It’s crawling because the performance of the A6 CPU is insanely slow by todays standards. Technology has moved so far beyond what’s in that iPad it’s mind boggling.


Dropping support on a 10 year old tech product is planned obsolescence? The industry standard is 2-3 years, so supporting 5 times longer can't be planned obsolescence.


You should inform yourself a bit better, the lifecycle of this Apple product is 4-5 times longer than most of the competition. But news articles about them attract clicks, no one cares about other tech companies.

Apple makes it's own hardware for the most part. They have one of the largest CNC machine factories in the world, making those aluminium housings for all the devices. They also make their own processors... That's why the shortages did not affect them much.


The iPad 4 is almost 10 years old. That's a ridiculously long lifespan for a tablet and it's not like it won't work. It just won't receive security updates any more.


What tablet manufacturer offers longer support for their devices?


Lol... tell me again how many non-Apple tablets from 10 years ago are in operation still.  

I'll wait.


Find a single android tablet that was supported for 9 years. I’ll just wait right here for you to come back. Seriously. This device has a totally obsolete 32bit A6x CPU which is barely fast enough to run ios much less any modern apps. Apple moved exclusively to 64-bit just a couple years later starting with the iPhone 5s the very next year after this iPad came out. To expect them to keep trying to update a device that is totally underpowered by any modern standards after 9 years is completely unreasonable.


Yes, wild that a company would stop supporting an electronic product 9 years after its release.


iPads don't have hardware supported by any Linux distro.


Wow what's your battery life?


Wasn't it released 9 years ago? Surprised it was still being updated, tbh


Safari does not update separately from iOS. What are you talking about?


>	A product becomes obsolete 5 years

Nope. A product becomes vintage after five years (meaning it will still get repaired, if the parts are available) and obsolete after seven years.


You have to provide 7 years of service. US Law


No

Apple stopped updating iPad 2's iOS in June 2016. The last update was in 2019, I think, to fix a GPS issue.


First gen ipad air here, hasn't had an OS update in a long time, can't watch hulu on it because they built their app to require a newer OS, even though the hardware has always been perfectly capable.  This shit is why my next tablet won't be apple.

ETA: Since so many people don't get it.  My apple tablet running an OS that was released in December 2020 can't run hulu.  My shitty old android tablet running android 7.0 can run it just fine.  The problem isn't that they aren't releasing new OS versions for this ipad anymore, it's how their older OS versions are locked out of running apps that they are perfectly capable of running.


 I can surf the web on my iPad 2 by using Dolphin or Safari. It's not Lightning fast but it works.

Heck, given that the YouTube app can no longer be installed on the iPad 2 (but YouTube Kids can, go figure THAT ONE out!) I can go to the YouTube website and watch videos that way.

Slow and Inefficient, but doable.


Any recommendation for manga?


IIRC, you could heat the frame, pop out the screen and upcycle into a display for anything with HDMI with a control board purchase.


You know what is worse?  I bought a Samsung Android tablet, and they stopped OS updates **2 years** after release.  Hardware is perfectly fine, but the OS gets increasingly outdated each day, and I can't update most applications anymore.  Apple is far better in supporting old hardware than any other company.


My iPad2 got deactivated and I can't activate again. A broken button is preventing me from doing a hard reset. I still can't throw it out. I have some hope I can get it fixed at a reasonable price. It is great as an ebook and comic reader. My Surface Pro is a nice laptop but I think it's a terrible tablet. I will never buy a laptop/tablet. It's either one or the other.


I had an OG ipad I wanted to turn into just a calendar, like, on the wall. 

Nope.  Couldn't even do that, functionality it came with. Worked fine though.


What App would you recommend to read manga/comics?


i stopped buying apple years ago. it was obvious how apple mysteriously slow down my devices when newer models come out. my ipod touch 1 was working perfectly fine till i updated 9 months later with a software update, right around the time a newer model came out. song started skipping all over. went to apple store to get it fixed. they just gave me another one. worked fine till i updated and the issue came back. went to apple store and they gave me another one. this time, the guy told me to never update the software.


I mean, I fully understand the frustration of having something you own sort of just… Stop working the way it was intended… But on the other hand, we’re talking about and ELEVEN YEAR Old piece of electronics hardware. I don’t have a single piece of computing hardware that old that still works… Not a one, and I’ve had probably six figures worth of computer hardware in my possession over the last 20 years. Something somewhere is a to give after a lumin of time frame, whether it’s a battery or a processor, or a main board, or just the hardware‘s inability to keep up with the modern software demands.

I took mine to the Apple store and they told me they dont repair them and tried to sell me a new one. YMMV


If the issue with the iPad is software related and could be easily resolved with a reset, probably. But if the issue goes deeper than that it’s not worth the hassle or cost for a device that old and no Apple repair store is going to spend much time on it. Apple also doesn’t repair iPads physically, they just replace them. They wouldn’t have the parts even to do so at that point.

Yours is worse. 

Loud'ed


Or for OLDER devices r/legacyjailbreak


The problem with letting people jailbreak their devices is that people who don’t know what they’re doing will destroy their devices with open source crap they think is cool. In turn, they will tell people Apple products suck instead saying they attempted something they didn’t fully understand. It’s easier for Apple to push back on jailbreaking than deal with negative publicity and angry customers wanting them to fix/replace the device under their warranty.


Well, when they stop providing updates even for security vulnerabilities breaks the device security. Allowing me to prepare and install patches myself - improves the security.


Absolutely.  When they stop supporting it, they should let the community do so.


The device is no longer getting security updates. It's security is already broken. 

It's also possible to implement a system that allows you to change the OS without impacting the device's security. See BootCamp on older MacBooks.


No, he wants them to provide one last update that unlocks the device and disables the security.  Or maybe let the Apple store do it for you.  Removing the security doesn't mean breaking it.


🧐


Right. It has to be legally enforced :)


This is a weird comment on a post about an iPad model being supported for 10 years. Are there many other tablets supported that long?


In my case it is opposite: I would not buy some kindle but use my old ipad instead. 
I’ve bought a new iPad regardless. I just hate throwing away a perfectly working device.


I bought a Samsung tablet, and they stopped OS updates ***2 years*** after release, or about 1 year after I bought it.  Total bullshit.  Now I can't even update applications anymore because the OS is too old.

iPhone 11 is still sold new. That means it will be supported at least through 2027 actually.


It could actually be longer than that. The oldest supported device that runs iOS 15 is the 6S which came out in 2015, but that window has been getting steadily longer as the hardware has gotten more capable. Considering the 11 is still sold new I wouldn’t be surprised if it ends up supported until 2028 or 2029.


Being the least bad is not something to be proud of. Apple's market capitalisation is nearly 3 trillion $. They should be required by law to provide security updates for the lifetime of the physical hardware. It's ridiculous.

Edit: It seems a whole lot of you just love getting shafted by big corporations that don't give a shit about you. It's quite sad.


It's not the port that they're no longer supporting...


Preaching to the choir son. The 1GB of RAM also cuts off a good chunk of otherwise serviceable apps


iPad Air 1 isn't even there yet (although it doesn't get updates). iPad Air 2 still gets full iOS updates, so I think it has a bit left to go.


There is really only one criteria for language: understandabililty. Other things are desirable, but that is the only hard and fast rule, you need some degree of agreement within a group so you can be understood.


Yeah I must admit I'm a bit behind the times.


I swear so many people have apple products now that lightning feels like standard and usb c the unusual one.


Yea prolly not, with all the ipad slow implemented on it 🤭


Its a computer. Its a processor, ram and hard drive. Offer support until it is impossible.

Oh boohoo


My first pad won't run the app, my second pad will, they are about to do to my second pad what they did to my first.  I think when the app gets updated I will be screwed.


[deleted]


Right


I’m not really sure, but it only lasts unplugged for maybe a couple hours. It lasts longer than the 1st gen iPod does, though.


Businesses keep stuff that works for as long as they can. Look how hard it was to obsolete XP and there are probably still businesses paying for support. It's not being updated for you, it's for the billion dollar companies that developed an inventory or POS system around it.


> Wasn't it released 9 years ago? Surprised it was still being updated, tbh

The last iOS update which applied to the iPad 2 was in 2016.


Umm… go into high end biology with environmental growth chambers and check what OS they all run on. All these computers were completely removed from networks years ago because they’re still running XP and in some cases older Operating Systems. Occasionally, if the manufacturer finds a critical issue that could kill all your rare birds, butterflies, molds, etc. that you’ve been breeding for N generations… so there might even be a patch to apply to these ancient, expensive things on even more ancient OPerating systems.

The university I work at has EGCs from the 60s and 70s in operation (no OS, all electronics) and every decade between then and today. fascinating to see the range of controller technologies.


Unlike the lies that most people and media tells you, Apple keeps things updated for a long time. I’ve used every brand of phone out there, they all are updated for similar amounts of time (Google actually updated less than Apple but you don’t hear about that).

A decade of updates for free is pretty nice


Well with the prices of processors etc. What was good 9 years ago is good again sort of.  Swap the harddrive in an old mac, perhaps add ram and you have a solid new one as well that might even be better than a lot of new ones (this is true for all brands)


This is correct (I work for Apple Support)


That’s state dependent. My memory on the matter isn’t 100% but that’s why Apple has both vintage and obsolete terms. In States like California they need to have service parts for 7 years. For other States like Texas it’s just 5 years.


Yes

Apples "obsolete" is a hardware thing. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624


Yeah my ipad 2 can not do anything I usually used it for since non of the apps can be updated on it. Youtube does not work at all anymore and Chrome really chugs. I have not even turned it on in 2 years since those were the main things I used it for.

I mainly used it when I was in my workshop while doing hobbies or when my wife and I traveled. I liked it more than having a full laptop with us. I am now scared to get another ipad and have been looking at getting a windows base tablet.


So they stopped updating it in 2019?


Thats all down to the Hulu developers not Apple.  I'm an app developer we have analytics that show fewer people use old versions of iOS so we drop it when it gets to less than 1%.  Even though the minimum SDK Apple currently supports is 13 you can still target iOS operating systems as old as iOS8 with that SDK,  there's just little point doing it.

On Android we support older versions because the analytics show that Android users keep using old OSs and devices and even users with newer devices don't upgrade their OS as frequently.  We still support as far back as Android 4 for some apps whilst iOS we only need to support as far back as iOS 14.  

Obviously it sucks if you are a user who still has a device that cannot be updated to iOS14 but, putting in hacks to support older OSs with hardly any users with deprecated SDKs takes time and as with most things these days, time is money.

TLDR: Its not your 2020 OS that cannot run Hulu,  its the Hulu developers who deliberately refuse to support your 2020 OS.


Does any other brand update 9 year old tablets?

Seems like an industry thing, not an apple thing.


The first gen ipad air was released in 2013 with iOS 7. The last update was in 2021 with iPad OS 12. Show me another tablet which was supported for eight years across 6 OS versions.


Um, android tablets get even less support unless you’re willing to flash a custom ROM on it, with all the issues that entails.


So your next tablet will be windows? Because sure as hell no Android tablet will get supported longer than three years, and that’s a very long time in Android years.


Apple is still arguably better than the competition though, at least they usually support their devices for 4+ years. I had a Galaxy Tab Pro which didn't even see a version upgrade from Samsung (it stayed on KitKat). While luckily there are many community developed ROMs for that device, it seems like it's getting harder to develop custom ROMs for the more recent devices. I don't think there's even an LineageOS port for the Tab S7 series, official or unofficial.

Windows tablets with x86 chips like the Surfaces might be the only choices if long term usage is expected.


I don’t know if it works the same for Hulu, but I had the same issue on my gen 2 ipad with YouTube.  All of a sudden the app just doesn’t work.  However, going to YouTube.com through the internet browser worked just fine.  Technology is weird.


So you still have a first gen iPad that still works. So next time you can buy a different make and you won’t have to worry about it lasting long enough to be obsolete. Good plan 👍


There's no other brand that will keep updates for so long. Apple has tons of bad things but this isn't one of them.


New Android apps won't run on old ass shit either.


That is one major problem with iOS: the only browser you are allowed to use is Safari, and that is distributed not as an app update but as an OS update.  When they stop updating the OS, your web browser gets stuck in time.  And that's a piece that really needs to be updated frequently.


His point is that despite getting plenty of updates, the older ios versions become completely unusable really quickly. For example, look at the galaxy s4 vs iPhone 5; two phones released in 2013. Try to use them both in 2022 and you'll see that the iPhone can't install hardly anything, not even youtube afaik on ios 10, vs the galaxy s4, on Android 5, still at least runs basically every app on the play store. 

Source: used both as a daily driver somewhat recently.

Edit: also this is probably mostly on developers dropping support rather than Apple, since unlike Android, Apple's phones are not very fragmented (most phones are on the latest version). Developers don't have much incentive to support older versions.


The YouTube kids app working there is specifically because Google knows kids get the older devices so it pays to support those for kids apps.


can't you jailbreak it and sideload older versions of the apps you need?


If you had the YouTube .ipa file, could you load that from PC/Mac iTunes?


I just did this. $25 board on eBay and boom, 1024x768 screen with HDMI, VGA, and DVI ports. I recommend it.


Damn, kind of regret smashing up that iPad 2 and throwing it away now - Didn't want to give away to anybody because it wasn't getting security updates etc.

EDIT: Smashed it up = drilled through it multiple times to try and destroy the hard drive


The older model iPads are actually pretty self repair friendly. If you’re looking for a fun project (and are able to eat a few bucks lost if you mess up)you could try doing it yourself. I’m sure ifixit has a tear down to follow.


Idk if you can, but there’s an accessibility setting that puts the button in screen. I used this when my iPhone 4 button stopped working. I think it’s called assistive touch.


That’s an easy fix you just need to buy the digitiser it comes with the button already and if you buy the kit will come with the tools to open the iPad. I always recommend spending a bit more for the proper tools but that’s on you. It’s a £10 fix whenever I’ve had to buy just the parts. First time will be a bit daunting but take your time and you will see how easy it really is. Good luck 🍀


Hey, time to crawl out from under your tinfoil hat


Apple even admitted they did this for "[conserving battery life](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/936268845/apple-agrees-to-pay-113-million-to-settle-batterygate-case-over-iphone-slowdowns)".


wasn't this to prevent shutdowns with aging batteries?


[deleted]


Not a bad thought


Ah, yeah, fair enough.


I’m confused how that’s unethical


Literally saving old tech from the land fill. Very ethical


They haven't been getting updates for like 5 years already. After that theyve only been getting bug fixes, with the last one in 2019.


We verbify every word in the US. 

Related: according to my phone, verbify is not a word, and I resent that.


That’s an imaginary issue, no one has started a witch hunt against windows because it lets you install whatever you want. Why would it happen to apple?


Your problem is people who don't know what they are doing bricking their devices? The alternative is eventually bricking everyone's devices. I don't think some people bricking their own devices is a worse PR problem than the company bricking everyone's devices directly.


Jesus you guys are dense. Every company does this, old devices are security risks. Why do you think android devices stop updating after like 2 years?


No one is stopping you from jailbreaking it? What are you guys crying about lmao


You want them to provide support for a device they are ending support for.

I just checked: my IPad 4 is on iOS 10.3.3 which is 5 years old. Doesn’t look like a support for me. 
What is actually changing now? Will it be banned from appstore?


Why?


They do periodically offer surprise security updates to much older hardware, to be fair. The cellular model of this very iPad got a security update in 2019, despite the last ‘official’ OS update being 9.3.5 back in 2016.

But where do you draw the line in supporting older hardware?

I mean, say you use a PC that can’t run anything past XP, but it serves your purpose for what you need it to do. Should MS still be sending out XP security patches for a dwindling number of users?


I own and still use one of these iPads. It seriously makes no sense for Apple to continue supporting this device. It has a totally obsolete 32bit CPU that is barely enough to run the OS much less the modern web. Mobile CPU’s have progressed so incredibly since this iPad was released. It is simply not capable of running modern apps. With that said, it still runs Mixing Station Pro just fine which is what I use to control my X32 for running live sound. The developer of that app explicitly supports older hardware, however.


Apple: “So we should make the hardware worse?”


I hate to break it to you, but all major operating systems and hardware from vendors don't even provide lifetime security updates.  It's not uncommon at all, and Apple is doing fine as far as I'm concerned (I work in IT infrastructure tech.)


I don’t blame them for not getting it the title is extremely stupid


I was going off of specifically the title. But whatever. Apple bois gonna hate regardless.


Oh right, they have different categories for vintage and obsolete. iPad Air 1 will be 10 years old soon, that's impressive.


Why should they? I build training courses. In doing so, I don’t have to live up to any expectation to go back and provide concordance training as long as the person that I trained is alive. Companies that support their technology for as long as Apple does get a pass in my opinion. That freakin iPad is ancient in terms of the market it occupies. People act like it’s going to self-destruct at midnight when it isn’t. If you’re still rocking that iPad 9 years later, then chances are you wouldn’t have even known they were dropping support unless some click-bait article told you.


what does the app do?


5th gen Anazon Fire tablets sold until a couple years ago are already discounted.

It's not like you can't use an ipad 1, 2, 3 or 4. They no longer offer software support and official repairs, but they did offer it for a decade. Your tablet had such support it for 2-3 years before it was obsolete. You can definitely use an old ipad as an ebook reader...


Also, the article isn't even about software.

The crazy thing. Just opened my ipad 2 after a couple months of not using it. 33% charged. They made a tank of a product.


One of my large banking clients still used Windows 3.11 for Workgroups until Y2K forced them to migrate to Windows 95 in September of 1999.


Partially true.  
Apple give them big incentives to replace old hardware.  
I work in the banking industry and in my previous job they had people with ipads replaced every couple of years (though not to the latest version) in order to keep ahead of the end of life support. They usually get monetary incentives to replace and return old hardware, mostly for RMAs and parts.


With XP, I would argue it’s partially because the Windows iterations after it were so awful. I know I hung onto it like grim death as long as I possibly could after trying a Windows 8 PC for a week.


Or how according to my good friend in navy crytpogoraphy (when he was still in it 5 years or so ago), that XP systems are the most security-hardened ones the gov't has for many applications.  I'm sure it's not the same XP we have.


My company uses Vista for ours. I’d rather have Windows Bob for our inventory. It’ll at least look fun.


I eat POS like you for breakfast.


Fun fact, the last iOS update which applied to the iPad 2 was in _2019_, for models with cellular data, to fix a GPS issue.


Same here at my university. We have some ancient boxes running lab equipment that the we've either taken off the network entirely or firewalled if they need connectivity.


Wow, these things badly need migration to Linux.


Sorry I had the terms mixed up in my head. Whoops.


This vouching is correct (I’m Tim Apple)


This is one of the reasons I really wish for full/absolute jailbreaks with something like Linux on it. Tinkerer's do wonders for old tech to strip it down to minimal installs. 

I've had old laptops I've been able to install stripped down OS's on that make them run butter smooth for most things I want to do on it.


You’re not going to get 8 years out many tech products, I’d say the little iPad did great


Why be scared to get another iPad? It's not an apple issue that has made yours slow down, its just an age thing. YouTube and Chrome are probably more resource intensive than a 10 year old iPad can handle. This will happen to any device eventually

Edit: Okay lol downvote all ya want folks. Technological illiteracy is cool. Apple bad!!


Feature updates vs. Bugfixes, they're different. But the guy you responded to was somehow using them interchangeably? Weird.


Yes


Stopped promising/supporting. 

If there needed/wanted to they could push a firmware update out for the original iPod. Companies will occasionally do thism Microsoft did it for Heartbleed a few years ago long after it stopped being supported.


>TLDR: Its not your 2020 OS that cannot run Hulu,  its the Hulu developers who deliberately refuse to support your 2020 OS.

From the end user's point of view, it doesn't matter.  I have two devices, only one of them (the older, non-apple one) can run the app, guess which I'm going to use?


There might be a niche few that do, but overall you are correct - none. 

However, most android devices are kept up to date by their owners through places like the wonderful devs at the XDA forums. My tablet is a galaxy tab pro 8.4, and I BELIEVE I could update it to the newest Android version if I wanted to.

Not insulting Apple for that not being an option, but just wanted to put it out there.


I can run hulu and disney+ on my tablet running android 7 (released in 2016) and not on my tablet running ios 12.5 (released December 2020).  The problem I'm complaining about is app support on not that old versions of their OS.


My first gen ipad air is running an OS that was released in December 2020, and they won't let me run a variety of apps (most annoyingly, hulu) on it.


And yet, my old android tablet running android 7.0 can still run hulu, while my apple tablet running an OS versions from December 2020 cannot.


Yeah, but Android devices don't get to the point where they simply don't work anymore just because they didn't get updated. I'm still using my Galaxy Note 3 for dedicated music streaming on my home stereo and I bring it with me camping to use as an additional camera and video recorder and backup GPS. But it still does everything else I would need it to do. Phone, browser, Facebook, email. It's a fully functioning device even tho it hasn't been updated in years


Sorry, I can see that I wasn't clear in my complaint.  It's not that the OS isn't updated anymore, it's that apps are requiring the latest OS and dropping support for OS versions that are not very old.  IOS 12 came out 3.5 years ago, IOS 12.5 barely over a year ago, and I can no longer use hulu on it.  Disney+ also won't update so it's just a matter of time before they require a newer version of the app that I can't use.  I don't have this problem on android, my old shitty android 7 tablet still runs hulu just fine.


With hulu, the old app didn't break, it was disabled, saying "you need to update to version X.Y.Z to use hulu", while that version requires a newer OS.


Ya, they’re gonna be very disappointed when their android tablet gets 6-12 months of support.


The problem isn't that that OS updates have stopped.  It's that apps that have run for years just fine on the old OS are requiring the new OS, making perfectly capable hardware less and less usable over time for no good reason.


You made this comment after my edit that includes an example of exactly that.

Chrome, Firefox, Edge, all available on iOS. Even Duck Duck Go has a browser on iOS.


Isn't this the exact thing Microsoft got in trouble for - bundling IE and Windows as a must-have package deal?


I use Brave on iPhone (newish) and iPad Air (1st version, a number of years old). Have used Dolphin on iOS as well.

Do newer Apple mobile devices limit users to Safari?


This is old information.  Since iOS 14 Apple supports different mail apps and browsers that can be set as the default apps from within settings.   Obviously not much good to you if your device is one that is stuck on an OS previous to iOS 14 but, then iOS 14 runs on devices from as far back as 2015.


And yet the Android one is riddled with security flaws that puts everyone at risk. Android is, in this way, much worse than Apple.


Ahh there's that explanation. Thanks for the info!


Nice! I’m hoping to do this type of salvage with some of my students.


What kind of frame did you use?


Damn, what kind of porn did you have on your iPad that you needed to physically destroy it to hide the evidence?

Also I’m pretty sure that unless you knew *exactly* where to drill, you didn’t destroy any data, and you had a pretty big risk of hitting battery, releasing toxic gasses and potentially a lithium fire


Thanks for the suggestion, I might look into it. It doesn't feel like a loss if I mess up as it's just a shiny brick at the moment.


That might work normally but at the moment it's like I just bought it. It needs to be activated. And the activation always fails. I was advised by Apple support to do a hard reset. But without that button, I can't do it. And the support didn't say anything about changing the button to the screen so I'm assuming it's not possible before the activation.

That's what they claimed. Whether or not that's true, we will never know.


Or so they claimed


Because if you brainwash enough people into believing that freedom is bad for them, it becomes general consensus. The concept goes back to serfdom.


And they shouldn't. Or at least they should try to allow stuff to not become e-waste. Also this signals the beginning of the end for lightning cables.


Who's crying?


No.  People want the ability to support the device themselves.    


"You won't update this anymore.  So give me the option to remove the 'security' that prevents me from doing my own updates to it."


Where was that even said?


No, I want them to stop blocking apps from running on an OS that's only 14 months old (ios 12.5).


"easier to deal with", but a non-jailbroken ipad offers you pretty much all the functionality anyone needs from a tablet... Even when the OS is outdated.


Obsolete, just means they won’t support servicing it anymore. If it breaks you can’t get it fixed at an apple store.


I have the generation after it. That could run an iPad version of Traktor. DJing a couple of tunes with zero latency is not a light task for a mobile device processor. I really don't think there are software use cases that have gone beyond these machine's capabilities for the vast majority of users. We should bear in mind that Apple have previous in intentionally underclocking old hardware to make it look like it can't keep up. 

There's no reason, other than the industry's predatory business practices, for devices with no moving parts to fall out of use after a decade. It's taken around 20 years for 64 bit to displace 32 in desktop. Just because this practices is normalised, doesn't mean it's right. If you explained this to someone technically minded 60 years ago they would say we're all being mugged, and chances are future generations will say so too. It's unsustainable and unconscionable, and I don't care how many people downvote me for saying so.

… you’re really taking my joke very seriously haha


A few years ago, I had to scour E-Bay to find replacement hardware for a Windows NT workstation running 2 machines and a conveyor system putting the item to be worked on in said machines.


If it’s airgapped, no problem with that, as long as it works. My father works in CNC machining and some machines still run on DOS


Yeah we do that. It's not connected online anyway, so it does not make a difference if it's XP oe W7 or Vista...


Super common in healthcare too. The hospital my MIL works at has been migrating XP machines to windows 7 for the past 5 years. Not a big hospital either.


“How It’s Made” showed a factory using an Apple II to run everything, it was honestly impressive.

I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them scour eBay for spares and parts.


They usually are.


They're synonyms


I always do especially in PoS vs PoW. It’s piece of shit vs POW in my mind


It's an Apple product so that's accurate.


Never worked in a restaurant? 😆


my ipad 2 is still working and was used every day. Original 10 year old battery.... Crazy!?


I had a summer job at one of the big three auto insurers in the summer of 1999. They were still using Windows 3.1.


Please tell me where this is because I work in the supply chain and sub-distribute iPads for POS and have never known Apple to give a penny or any incentive for anyone to buy anything new. Here Apple’s attitude is basically “you should consider yourself lucky we even allow you to buy our products”.


Windows 7 was better than XP, no comment on vista or ME or 8.

Windows 10 was at least not worse than windows 7.

Although my dad’s computer still runs 7, come to think of it.

They’ve crippled Ipads 1-3. OS is 9.35 and no browser will open some web pages. Apps that would work now do not. Aside from software the hardware does work. Excellent battery life still. I can still watch TV on them from an app but cannot access newspaper subscription. I think it has to do with ability to play ads than any security.


This vouch-confirmation is correct (I’m an apple)


I agree to an extent. I do not see how having a single tab of reddit open would cause that much stress for an older device. I know the ipad was never a power house but it never had issues with it before 2016.


No. I have Ipad 3’s and can watch the latest Tv in HD but can’t play YT as Google crippled it. Now I have to open a web page on an old browser to watch.


Scared maybe was not the best word to use. I think I should have said wary or leery. I am saying it because I think I rather switch to a windows based 2 in 1 for my next "tablet". One that I could upgrade with more ram. I do not see microsoft just straight up say "NO MORE UPDATES ALLOWED" on windows 11 stuff anytime soon.

Apple said they would no longer update for the ipad 2 and also that  any app made with a new Xcode would no longer work for older iOS and only for the newer stuff.


My Nexus 7 from 2013 is still able to play YouTube videos and visit websites (however it has a hard time on some ad heavy sites). It's not a hardware thing for the meantime.

It's a side effect of the long support times, since your iPad or iPhone is getting updates quickly to the latest version, I've seen apps target the 3 latest iOS releases, when your iDevice is unsupported it's a couple years to be unsupported by everything.

On Android, I've seen apps still target up from Lollipop, which released 7 or 8 years ago.

Both are software updates. I would call both a system update too


>From the end user's point of view, it doesn't matter.  I have two devices, only one of them (the older, non-apple one) can run the app, guess which I'm going to use?

AKA "I'm an android fanboy complaining on reddit while I don't understand how technology works"


Most end users have upgraded.  Hulu have checked the analytics and decided that there's so few people in your position that they simply don't matter.


Tried a custom rom once on my previous phone (Samsung S7), but it gave echoes during calls.

Anyway, the fact that some guy in his basement can make an update (even uf buggy) for a random android phone, but major brands like Samsung with an army of IT engineers stop updating flagships after 2 years, is simply just sad and I'm definitely trying to no longer support such companies.


You can jailbreak your Apple products after they’ve stopped supporting them.


That's up to the app devs, not the device. How dense are you lmao


You *can* but that doesn't mean you *should*. You're literally putting yours and everyone else's data at risk by continuing to run such old software.

But the app support thing is entirely on the app developer here. They could continue to support it, they just choose not to.


That sounds like something else, because according to Hulu you need minimum OS version 12.0 but they recommend 13.0, both of those were released before 2020, and I’m also using Hulu fine on an older ipad that’s on 13.1

Apps absolutely sometimes stop working when they use new features that older OS versions don’t  have, but basic apps like streaming services also know prior tend to use iPads for 5+ years so that would be pretty stupid of them to break something fairly recent.


I don’t understand how it’s Apple’s fault that Google made breaking changes to YouTube’s APIs, and then decided not to release a new version of their app that was compatible with a legacy version of iOS.


Apple devices don’t magically break when support stops, you can also jailbreak to run things that otherwise no longer support your iPad.


Well, same applies to my iPad Air 2 released in 2014.


This is why I use Apple products. Around 2018, I tried switching to Android. I bought an unlocked Motorola, mid line, newest in the line at the time, for about $400.

When the availability of Android 9.0 was announced, I actually thought there was something wrong with the phone because it kept telling me the OS was up to date. I restarted it, reformatted it, and even tried skipping the initial sign in to see if it would update if there weren't any account services running to possibly interfere. Then I learned about the convoluted process that all "Android 9.0 released to general public" means is that Google has made the code available and it's STILL on Motorola to compile it for my device and make the update available. It took that phone NINE MONTHS to receive that update, and despite being only a year old, Motorola announced that phone would not be receiving Android 10 at all. I traded it back for an iPhone SE.


My android 7.0 (2016) tablet still runs the apps that my iOS 12.5 (12/2020) tablet doesn't support anymore.


It's the same for every OS.  Apps are constantly updated, using new programming tools and SDKs with some functions that are not supported for older versions of the OS, so the app can't be updated in your device at certain point. Then the developers decide to rule out older versions of the app because they won't support new things they want to add in, or security features.

What I wanted to explain is that it isn't Apple's fault, and I won't blame the app devs for not wanting to put the resources needed to support 10 year old versions of apps.


[Firefox on iOS doesn't use the Gecko rendering engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_for_iOS) like on other platforms. It uses Webkit, same as Safari on iOS.

So, the logo says Firefox, but under the hood, it's Webkit, same as Safari.


That's just a skin. iOS doesn't allow third party browser engines.


In iOS all browsers use the same underlying Safari engine.


Which on iOS is using safari's rendering engine.


They all use WebKit under the hood as Apple enforces that. No updates to WebKit = all those browsers are using an outdated engine that will inevitably get left behind as the web progresses.


All of which use Safari under the hood.  Even Firefox isn't using gecko on iOS.


Sort of. You could always install another browser, but 99% of people wouldn't bother at the time.


As always, power changes everything.  Apple isn't a monopoly.  If your *only* OS vendor makes itself your only browser vendor, that becomes a problem, because that's using monopoly power to crush other businesses.  It's less true if your OS vendor is one of two major competitors.


Brave on iPhone is still using safari under the hood.  Even Firefox is.  You are not allowed to use any other browser engine on iOS.


At the moment I have a photo frame (8x10” iirc) with a mat that it fits in as a “proof of concept”, but as it’s part of a larger retroPi setup so I’m working on designing and 3d printing a frame that includes spots for a Pi4, the controller board, fan and power adapter. 

Tricky part is my printer bed isn’t big enough so I have to split it and make it join together right.


My only advice is make sure you know what screwdrivers you need up front! Nothing more annoying than realizing you’ve got all the parts but no way to get the damn thing open lol


Have you tried to initiate the reset though iTunes?


You can do this using iTunes or perhaps the free software called reiboot


PR probably decided to not advertise a battery service as a fix, the code in the operating system was probably written by the engineering team to keep battery life up.


Guess what? Their PR department is bound by the laws of physics. As batteries age they can no longer supply the same amount of current. The amount the software and CPU demand remain the same at peak load. So you can either throttle it or you can just let the phone shut off when the CPU can't get enough current.

There's no PR department conspiracy here. It's basic physics.


Checked the law suit, so it was for the sake of keeping aging batteries from shutting down the phone - and that makes total sense from a technical standpoint. Their fuck up was to not tell customers that a cheap battery service (69 USD at that time) would resolve the issue.


It's physics. It's *basic physics*. As batteries age they can no longer supply the same amount of current as when they were new. Yet your phone's software will still demand just as much peak current under full load as when it was new.

So guess what? You get two choices. You can either throttle the CPU or you can simply let the whole phone shut off when the battery can't meet the demand.

There's no guessing. We know this to be true.

> Apple **should provide an official way to jailbreak an unsupported devices**.


They’re doing that? What apps?


Yeah but the comment is about bashing apple for limited product support, which is not really the case....


Badum-tsss.


There is a ton of that sort of thing going on as far as I know.

Hell, I watched a video a while back about a brand new single board pc that emulates an old DOS pc specifically for rescuing ancient equipment.

Plenty of businesses run on old ass equipment that just works, and replacing it costs tons.  Spending a few thousand to keep it running for another year or three is peanuts compared to full replacement.


Government had some systems running windows 98


I have seen machine code being typed directly on a CNC control panel, some stuff will never go away.

Hey! I sell those you know!

(You are correct)


Mines got enough processing power to turn itself on that’s about it


Really, what do you use it for in daily basis?
I found most of the applications are not supported anymore.


yeah they may be confused with the PoS company giving the incentives vs apple. i've definitely gotten free readers/ipads just not from apple


> and have never known Apple to give a penny or any incentive for anyone to buy anything new.

They didn't buy anything "new".  
I talked to the guy who is in charge there. He say they are buying old stocks / refurbished stocks through their parent company which buys directly from apple.  
They receive a better pricing through returning old ipads. But they also pay for support (which I expect where the bigger income arrives).      
They receive full support on all the ipads and workers can take broken/not working ipads to apple authorized repair locations to get a replacement.


I went from XP to 7, after 8 had been around for a while. Now I have 10, mainly because I shared  my PC with one of my kids who needed 10 for some uses.  I’m used to it now but still prefer how some of the functions I have to use all the time (uploading and editing photos etc) worked in XP and 7.  I thought it might be a familiarity thing, but no, 10 still is mediocre at best there.


security-hardened is not a synonym for impervious.


The reason they are obsoleted is due to the older hardware and the cost of continuing to develop updates.  They’re not going to spend a lot of engineering time on 10+ year old products, the fact that they are supported for as long as they are is absolutely legendary.  Bravo on their part, making that happen requires enormous dedication and long-term planning.

The reason it takes so much engineering time to support older products (since it might not be clear for non-tech people who think “hardware is hardware”) is for a couple reasons: chip architecture, performance, and testing.  

Different chips have different capabilities.  Older chips might not have some optimizations/capabilities required by newer software and those must be worked around in software.  That is going to make performance (potentially much) worse because doing it in software on an old/slow chip cuts into the processing power available for standard functionality.  

New features are also usually designed to take advantage of more processing power, so they aren’t going to run as well on older hardware.  That requires significant engineering effort to implement performance optimizations on old devices, and those engineers could be working on making new devices better rather than only making stuff functional on old devices.

Bugs are another issue, new features and new software are going to require a lot of testing to get to a high standard of quality.  Fixing those requires lots of engineering time to find solutions that are workable on old devices.  

If you add all that up, that’s multiple millions of dollars per year (at a minimum) just to keep updates going for old devices.  At some point it just doesn’t make sense to spend all those millions year after year to support something that isn’t adding any revenue.  That’s why most Android devices get 2-3 years of support and that’s it.


Doesn’t really work that way. No-one has deliberately crippled anything, it’s just been left behind. Many websites will be targeting newer browser APIs that the old Safari version doesn’t support. Apps update their minimum supported OS version over time, and if the old versions rely on any external services they might get switched off which is why stuff stops working. Still sucks though.


The web browser problem is probably due to changes in SSL. Basically they can’t load pages because the OS has no idea how to deal with the SSL certificate that sites send when the browser tries to securely connect to them (which is most sites, since most sites now use HTTPS).

The only way Apple could fix this is if they put out an update the iOS 9’s certificate handling system.

It’s probably not a good idea to browse the web on a browser that old anyway, it’s highly vulnerable to exploits coming in through ads and other malicious websites due to years of unpatched vulnerabilities.


Sounds like Google's fault for making a bloated clunky app.


> "NO MORE UPDATES ALLOWED" on windows 11 stuff anytime soon.


Windows 11 is the latest Windows OS. Why are you comparing it to a nearly decade old iOS? Windows 8 support ended in 2016.


Yeah computers are more open-source, you can install a different OS on it.


But the problem with 2-in-1 laptops was that they try to be a tablet and a laptop, and they end up being a shitty tablet and a shitty laptop (or they are really expensive). If a laptop fits your needs it's great, but if you need a tablet the windows tablets are designed to add that functionality while ipados is entirely built for touchscreen use...


A lot of the tablet 2 in 1s have soldered everything. So no easy upgrade path there.


They will. The Surface tablets reached their "end of servicing" dates recently too, you just don't see headlines about it here because people here are locked in a blind hate for Apple and, surprisingly, are largely technologically illiterate. 

The life spans of the surfaces is less than any iPad's.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-driver-firmware-lifecycle-support#surface-driver-and-firmware-servicing-dates

And yeah new code doesn't work on devices that don't have that update because that's just how computers work. If the update includes something that the old iPad's don't have, the old iPad can't get the update. If the ipad can't get the update, and the update includes a code library update, the iPad has no way to know that and no way to use the code with the new library. That's true of every computer ever, not just iPads


>I do not see microsoft just straight up say "NO MORE UPDATES ALLOWED" on windows 11 stuff anytime soon.

They're literally doing this for Windows 10. October 14th, 2025 is the last day of support for Windows 10. They will also do this for Windows 11.

Apple is known to support their products for many years, so let's not pretend like Microsoft is a saint here.


> I do not see microsoft just straight up say "NO MORE UPDATES ALLOWED" on windows 11 stuff anytime soon.  
>  
>Apple said they would no longer update for the ipad 2 and also that  any app made with a new Xcode would no longer work for older iOS and only for the newer stuff.

Are you new to technology in general or just an apple hater?   


Microsoft literally does this, so does Android devices. This is nothing new lol.


Then it's on the app devs if they don't support your device. All the apps on my iPod touch from high school still work fine.

Most devs don't want to maintain support for a device from 2011, and you can't really be surprised that the hardware in the second iPad ever is lagging behind modern devices. Android isn't immune to this, people here are just blinded by their lack of understanding of how technology works and their redditor hate for Apple.

I'm skeptical that android devs are so much better at this, considering that most devs develop for both platforms, and that the software lifespan of apple devices is more than any android's.

Also this person is taking about the YouTube app, not just YouTube in browser.


Literally everyone is worse than Apple in this sense. They're the only ones to keep giving updates and repair service for their older hardware.

Microsoft Surface computers are absolutely horrible in comparison to ipads when it comes to longevity. Many models can't be repaired at all, warranty repairs just straight up replace the device. You can be certain nothing would make Microsoft happier if they were able to take the phone-OS approach to x64 computers and make the older models obsolete in a couple years, but the business use and classic expectation of how a desktop OS isn't so integrated with the hardware is preventing them. With the switch to ARM, we might see a more Apple-like approach though, and tightly integrate the software with their hardware and prevent third party OS installations.


You're projecting your apple fanboyism onto me.  I'm not a fanboy of either, I own both, I'm just pointing out facts here.


correct me if im wrong but to my knowledge jailbreaking an Apple product doesn't mean you can get updates to it that Apple hasn't made. Custom roms for Android devices are whole updates to the firmware not just hacked in features. 

Also can jailbreaking an iPad/iPhone get you something like Hulu thats no longer supporting older iOS versions?


Yes, and yet 100% of the times I've encountered this type of issue, it was on apple, not android, and I've owned a lot more android devices than apple.  Seems to be something about the apple app ecosystem that encourages this shit.


Is hulu going to hack me?  I literally only use that shitty old tablet to run the apps that the ipad doesn't run anymore.  I am not afraid of getting hacked on a device I don't even run a web browser or mail client on.


Yeah, I submitted a correction to that hulu page that says ios 12 is supported, because it's not anymore.  That was like 6 months ago, and they still list the wrong info.


Well, there are numerous people commenting that they lost the use of their browser when they stopped getting updates for their Apple products. I'm just going off that, I have only 28 days of experience with an Apple device. Didn't like it so I traded it in


That type of bullshit is why I switched from Android along with Apple ecosystem stuff. I was using a mid-teir phone from 2016 that hadn't had a os update since 2017 and not a regular update for bugs since maybe 2018-2019. My parents iPhone 6s pluses still receive full ios updates from apple to this day.


[deleted]


Perfectly reasonable to blame the app developers, yet this problem has only happened for me on the ios side, not android, despite me having much older versions of android running here.


Oh shit, you're right, I didn't know that! So I guess the differences in browsers on iOS come down to the non-rendering features (bookmark management, etc)?


Is that the case? The leading comment says "the only browser you are allowed to use"


Bleh


Honestly wouldn't recommend it.
You need at least 20-50$ in tools (enough spudgers to pry, something to heat the adhesive, the correct screwdriver bits, new adhesive) and probably another $25 in parts (digitizer+glass, button flex cable) cause the chance you crack a screen your first go is huge.

You're already in for $75 and haven't even started the repair where you can damage or kill things like the lcd panel or the motherboard.
The buttons on ipad 2 are ok to replace, but still hard to click like the factory click.

Newer ipads aren't that more difficult, your margin of error is a lot smaller (smaller bezels) but the 2020 ipad i opened up last week still basically looks the same to get into as everything since ipad 2.


I could connect with iTunes but I couldn't force a hard reset from there.

Right, I remembered that they claimed that in the lawsuit. Now whether or not that is actually true is a different story. If this is an issue that will happen if they don't slow down the phones, why do non Apple phones not experience shutdowns when their batteries start aging? If this was a necessary action, then either Android phones would employ the same or similar fix, or shutdowns due to old batteries would be rampant among aging Android phones. Neither of which are true. 

So that's why I am skeptical of Apple's claim.


You realise creating that one tool when you make something obsolete isn't ongoing support right?

Make the tool that jailbreaks it on the latest release, release it, job done.

The last support action is to provide an official way to unlock the device.


One famous one i know, mclaran maintains and uses 1990 era compaq laptops. The laptop is the only machine with the right interface/that can run the software etc, that comunicates with the mclaran f1 supercar. Because there are only 100 or so of that car in the first place, its much easier to maintain and keep the 1990's laptop that works, than to write new software and make the old interface work with modern pcs etc.


Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over the dot-matrix printer I commanded via SABRE.


Yeah, large industrial machines can easily cost 7-8 figures, and have a 12-36 month lead time. If what you’ve got is working for you, keep it going until you absolutely have to drop millions in capex.


I worked for the a department of the Canadian government in the late 00s and I regularly had to open a virtual DOS system to access a bunch of law enforcement related databases.


Heard


Why is there never a left keypad option on screen? As a cashier that would be great.


They're still useful as eReaders, for playing music, as photo frames, for running games installed when they were supported, for word processing, as a VNC or SSH client... (Still have my first gen iPad.)


Yes. They informed me that they were going to be updating it and I couldn’t update it as my OS did not meet the new spec. YT worked perfectly. They crippled it on purpose probably because of something to do with managing ads on the app and not anything else.


I never said anything about getting a surface tablet. I specifically said a windows 11 2 in 1. Many other companies make windows based tablets. Also you seem to be insinuating that I am some sort of apple hater? Let me look at the last 4 phones I have had.... yup all iphones. Since I am an apple product user that instantly makes me no longer "technologically illiterate" right.

I fully understand that old systems can not understand newer code with new libraries but when they force it to be obsolete and do not allow it to become an open system as they no longer care about it or allow people to still push new updates to it using old code, that seems shitty.


The difference is that microsoft is not saying "NO MORE UPDATES" to people that still want to make programs that will work for windows 10. They themselves will no longer support it but they are not shutting down the ability to. People are still free to make programs for windows 98, xp, hell even 3.1 if they wanted to. 

Can I get on my ipad 2 and start updating any of my apps though the app store? Can I update anything through a website or is the whole thing locked down now unless I jailbreak it to get rid of the apple lockdown?


Most iPhone users are on the latest version of iOS, so if a developer supports just the last two or so iOS versions, they’ll cover like >90% of all iPhone users. Whereas Android users are rarely on the latest version of Android since each device manufacturer has to modify and push Android updates independently, so to cover >90% of Android users, they have to support 3+ versions of Android.


To your first assertion, that’s true from what limited knowledge I have, I’ve not needed to, because iOS devices get supported for so long. 

As to the latter, yes, that’s my understanding, you can install unsigned or non-app-store approved software. That could just be a more permissive browser from which you can view Hulu or Netflix.


Yup. Until I can purchase any Android phone on the market and know it will, for a fact, receive at least 2-3 incremental updates, I'll never consider another Android option. People can talk all the shit they want about proprietary technologies Apple uses, but they can't say that Apple doesn't stand by their products.


I'm not confusing anything, the revision I left off the android version is ".0" and it hasn't been patched in that long.  It was a piece of crap bundled with some exercise equipment and they don't provide any real support for it.  It IS several years older than the iOS I'm comparing it to.


I think you are not aware of how much trouble and time consuming is mantaining older versions. It drags the developement team a lot,  because sometimes you will need different implementations to add the same feature, security issues...


Yeah, sadly.

I'm considering getting an iphone but I'm going to miss having real firefox available.


I was referencing the Microsoft case in the 90's. There was always Netscape Navigator or Mosaic (and probably a few others that were less common), but the argument was that if the browser was part of Windows and was also embedded into the filesystem (you could browse URLs directly from file explorer) that nobody would bother to install anything else and MSFT would have a total monopoly on web browsing. It wasn't the case that you couldn't install another browser at all, just that practically speaking, few people would.

I thought you could install Chrome on iOS devices, though, so I'm not sure that part of the leading comment is correct.

lol calm down what is your problem? there are multiple comments outlining what they did wrong, but god forbid that we look at the possible reasons how they ended up in a situation like this right?


There's no lying and you *can* change the battery.


I beg to differ; I have a couple of Android Phones that started shutting down at weird percentages (~30%) and upon reboot the battery is apparently flat, which makes it shut down a second time. (Xiaomi Mi 5 and a BlackBerry Priv)

Another thing was when I first received my iPhone 6 a year ago; I replaced the battery through Apple a little while after and the performance boost from that alone was substantial enough to support the claim it was to prevent sudden shutdowns.


Android phones do this too. What's the longest you've ever owned a phone? Had this happen to my Note 4, Moto g, and Moto g plus.

I think the reason you see it less on Android is because they handle it a bit differently on the software side. Most of the time the phone won't actually completely shut down and instead you'll just see the battery percentage jump from something like 80% down to something like 27% out of nowhere. On Android it doesn't tend to actually shut down unless the cell that skips takes it all the way down to a low enough charge to power off.

As someone who has experience with both platforms I can tell you they both do this when the battery wears out. You can mitigate it with software and then till recently I think Android was handling it better but in general once the battery cells start wearing out this can absolutely happen on both platforms.

Hell, I've had this happen on Windows computers anything with a lithium battery can have that happen.


All I’m saying is they didn’t do this with the mac and when my girlfriends couple year old mac hits 20% battery it just fucking dies.


>You realise creating that one tool when you make something obsolete isn't ongoing support right?

Yeah create a tool, people that can't turn on a PC attempt to use it, now they need to support that tool.   


You guys are asking for unrealistic things. There's plenty of info out there on jailbreaking. Do you expect samsung to do the same thing when they stop updates after 2 years of release?


You realize “creating a tool” **is** “providing support”, right?

>Make the tool that jailbreaks it on the latest release, release it, job done.

“Provide support, then you will have provided support”.

>The last support action is to provide an official way to unlock the device.

It’s very clearly not, according to the manufacture of the device in question.


Kinda, but not really, going off topic; the upkeep of McLarens is an art form. There’s a really good video on YouTube of it.

First gen was amazing when it came out, but there was also a major leap when the ipad 2 came out (I don't think any other ipad upgrade made such a big difference, the OG really wasn't powerful).


[deleted]


I can still install many apps on my ipad 2.


The minimum target Apple allows with iOS 15 SDK (that's the dev kit, not iOS version) is iOS 9. This is an app developer problem, not Apple problem. This thread is full of misinformation and people that simply hate Apple because they're a big company.

Microsoft is arguably making things worse for everyone by allowing such old software to remain online.


>The difference is that microsoft is not saying "NO MORE UPDATES" to people that still want to make programs that will work for windows 10

Eventually they will, I mean not right now obviously, they've done that thousands of other times in the past. You're clueless. Try working in healthcare, we still machines running XP because of software / updating issues.


>Yup. Until I can purchase any Android phone on the market and know it will, for a fact, receive at least 2-3 incremental updates

Just look for any certified Android One device


Seems like that might be the cost to have a professional do it though.


B-but corporations bad! Must do bad things! All mistakes because mean!!

No they don't need to support that tool ever again.

If you'd owned an android phone 10 years ago you'd see what people do.

Even without a tool you can jailbreak an iPad. They just need a single bit of code that does it officially.


Apple isn’t crippling it. YouTube is choosing not to continue to provide an app that supports that version of iOS. Apple makes it pretty easy to do so. 


The reason apple doesn’t support new OS versions indefinitely is that the OS comes with baked in features that apps are built on. An iPhone on iOS 15 supports a bunch of things that an iPhone on iOS 14 doesn’t, and many of these features leverage new hardware and won’t work well on processors that don’t come with hardware support for those features. 

The approach isn’t without drawbacks, but the reason the app ecosystem is so successful is partly because of the design choices they’ve made, and they provide direct support for their hardware for significantly longer than anyone does on Android.


So you are saying it is impossible for anyone to make a program that works on windows xp right now. Microsoft has pushed out an update that makes it impossible for anyone to every do anything on that platform again? 

Microsoft might not support windows XP anymore but they are not forcing anyone else to stop supporting their own programs on it. You are clueless.

Maybe I am wrong but I am pretty sure it is impossible for someone to make a new app for the ipad 2 and push it out on the app store. You apple fan boy are the worst.

At least Canada has the dignity of not having pennies.


Growing up I had this truck that my parents used to throw their loose change in. Every year or two I’d count and roll it up with my mom and usually have nearly a hundred dollars. The odd loonie or toonie was really helpful, but it was mostly smaller stuff and the bag was quite heavy as I brought it to the store. I paid 78$ for a 13 inch tube tv with an RCA connection so I could play my ps2 in my room. Or one year I bought a bike from Canadian tire that I used for years and years.


[deleted]


You know what? It may be a mean move to some people, but if I was still working customer service, I'd be happy to count everything.

My boss after 1 hour would be why aren't you helping others?! Points at all the coins, proceeds to slowly and enjoyingly continue counting.


Technically they didn't have to accept it as payment.  This goes way beyond the maximum they are obligated to take, it's $25 loonies, $40 in toonies, $10 in each 10c 25c and 50c, and $5 in 5c.

Edit. Max total is $110


I’d like one attention, please.


I get the Fuck Apple mentality, but these are just employees. If you really wanna fuck Apple, don't buy their shit to begin with.


Why the fuck did they not turn those coins into a counting machine to get *some* amount of bills?


iPaid


Good thing they weren't trying to buy their prescription.


Go the the bank first ffs


Damn. What a move. 
Couldn't the store refuse to make the sale with such a ridiculous amount of coins? At least here in Denmark they could. 🤷‍♂️


Real main character syndrome vibes from OP

Rude AF.


I'm seeing a few US quarters, are they used fairly commonly in Canada? I see maybe a few Canadian cents a year here in the Midwest.


Why??? Why not roll them and take them to a bank or credit Union and get cash? 
I don’t think they charge you any fee if you roll the coins yourself. Or if they do it’s probably minimal.


This is evil


OP is a dick. Go to a bank, it's not that hard. You're just knowingly wasting people's time. At least bank employees are paid to count money. It's hard enough working retail without shit-heads doing stuff like this.


This picture is quite old


Was that Kramer?


I worked as a shift manager for a Best Buy many, many moons ago.  We had one customer who was constantly difficult and annoyed the shit out of us.  Always complained about the dumbest shit, and tried to keep schooling us on tech even though he was constantly wrong.  So he would buy something that didn't fit whatever stupid thing he was trying to do, and then come back to return the item and complain some more.  We fucking hated him.

Here he comes one day to buy a new laptop which cost about $1500, and he decides to pay with rolled up coins.  A huge fucking stack of quarters, dimes, and nickels (no pennies thank god).  And he had a shit eating grin on his face.

He knew that the policy said we had to accept these coins as legal tender, which is absolutely fine.  But what he didn't know was that we had to confirm that every coin was legit and count it.  My teammates were pretty peeved at this, so I decided to take over and fuck with this guy's time just so my guy's could get back to real work.

I closed the check out counter so that no one else waited on me.  I unrolled every stack of coins and personally inspected every single one and counted them before putting them back into the paper roll.  The look on his face when he realized that I was serious.  I can see it every time.

After about 30 minutes, he decided that he wasn't going to buy the laptop, and took back all of his rolled coins.  Fuck that dude forever.

The Canadian Currency Act could have been used to tell you to go f yourself, but they decided to be nice (or weren't aware of the act) and obliged this silly transaction


Coin collectors are gonna be making angry TikToks about this post in a day.


By doing this, you're telling that worker you don't respect their time. One of the biggest look at me selfish things I've seen in a long time.


Couldn't even roll your coin smh


What a dick move. Just take it to the bank where they have a proper coin counter and have it paid out in bills.


You are a major league doushe bag.


What a dick


Don't do this kind of shit in regular stores.

First you go to the bank and deposit the coins, there they have specialised machines to handle the situation, most of the time the bank teller will count it in seconds.

When you go to a regular store and do this you make a employee count by hand and is a pain in the ass for them. They are there to sell the product, not count 10kg of coins.

Oh and also, banks like to have coins so it's even better for them.


Dickwad level 100.


How many different forms of currency?


I’m surprised they take cash?

It’s actually not considered legal tender to use that many coins in a transaction. Although most don’t know this in Canada:

https://www.cplea.ca/a-question-about-paying-with-coins/


I once had a customer pay in all $5 and $10 bills for an iPad Pro, it came out to $2500-ish. It took two sales, two managers, and a counting machine three times to get it counted proper. 

Business as usual at Apple.


Awesome. Economy is way different but I could still get a nickel or a dime for a deposit bottle when I was young and I bought all kinds of things with a sack full of coins. Fast forward and I remember when the bank laughed at me 15 years ago or so for trying to deposit


bad day to work at Apple


I worked at a bank, and we wouldn’t accept coin unless it was rolled. We provided the roller paper for free, but that’s the rule. I think that if that were the case everywhere, this situation would have been vastly more practical for all parties involved.


Couldn't stop at the bank to exchange?


Fun fact, store could refuse the money. Legally. 
There is a law about what constitutes legal tender in Canada when it comes to coins. 

Limitation
(2) A tender of payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;

(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;

(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;

(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and

(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

In Japan you can deposit coins at your local ATM and cash them out as paper bills.


Paying with coins? That's absolutely loonie!


You know what’s ironic, this post came up immediately after a video of a man being refused his prescription because he was trying to pay in coins. What a twisted world we live in.


Sadly, I once had to ring a woman at the fruit stand for two iPads and when asked how she wanted to pay she pulled out sweaty rubber banded sets of ones from her cleavage. It’s policy over a certain amount to count out every dollar and then have someone else check your count. 2k in disgusting moist ones checked by hand twice. Afterwards our manager told us to wash our hands, and my coworker Jesse just made eye contact with me and licked his hand.


This is an old photo, they haven’t worn that color shirt and worn radios in a long while


Looks pretty loonie to me.


The best buy I worked at 10 years ago stopped accepting cash when I worked there. The salt was real when I told people we only accepted cards or mobile pay. 

I would have enjoyed turning the op away 😆


Why are people like this? You can go to the bank and get the coins into bills. I have only done this once. It was six bucks in mostly quarters to get into a firearm show.


I just scrolled past a post of a guy trying to buy his medications at Walmart with coins and they refused to accept them.


OK, so earlier reddit was calling a pharmacist a piece of shit for having the customer exchange their coins to bills at the front customer service station, meanwhile in this thread we're shitting on the dude for buying an Ipad with commissioned employees?   


Have we lost the fucking plot? How about this: Banks will exchange this shit for free. And the last people you should be complaining about rushing through customers are Pharmacy staff. Ffs.


It’s slightly comical to me that she chose to use a pencil and paper to keep count instead of using an iPad.


I absolutely love every thing about this! The one year for my tax return i ordered a box of gold coins from the bank because that was the only way i could get a decent amount of gold dollars. (USA) a box of gold dollars is $1,000 and i spent the whole 1000 as the gold coins. I kept what i wasnt using in a cigar box that looked exactly like a treasure chest  and even had a leather satchel i got from the Renaissance Fair that I wore to carry the coins in. 

The really fun part about this was spending it. In the US people dont use dollar coins for purchase that often certainly not in any large quantities. I had some friends a owed money to and i paid them back exclusivly in the gold coins. They begged me not to but i really couldnt help myself.  Carring so many coins is a bit of a logistical problem and one of my friends sent my a photo of his hand with a leather pouch with the coins saying "look what i have been reduced to" another refused to even spend them. 

Every one hated them but i had a great time. The most i spent at one time was like 150 at boscoves and cashier couldnt fit them in the til. She actually sent me to customer service because of it. Some places tried to not even accept the coins even though they are legal US tender.  10 out of 10 would do again.


What an asshole.

Those are Canadian coins. The vendor did not have to accept that many as payment. That many coins exceeds what is considered legal tender when paying by coin.

I don't... get it... Why not roll up those coins and change them for bills at a bank, then take the cash to buy the ipad? This is just so inconvenient...


I want that cup


Just take it to the bank lol


I wouldn’t be surprised if that once was grandpas coin collection.


Next time a Canadian casually mentions they don't use a penny again, I'll say "Why, because this guy saved them all to buy an iphone?"


Beyond a certain quantity, change is no longer legal tender in Canada.


I'd just tell them to go to a bank and get it changed into 50s/100's cause this is ridiculous.


They could’ve easily put this in a card at the bank. Go to the teller and they accept coins but put them in a Flat coin wrapper. Buy them from a super market. U put like 20 dimes or something to make it a specified amount of dollars from coins.


How old is this picture? Those iPads are at least a few years old but not sure how old those Beats models are


Could've at least been kind enough to roll your coins first, FFS.


Wouldn't carrying around that many coins get cumbersome?


I am not sure what currency that is but why in the world would you not go to the bank first and get that cashed out? Is it not available in this country?


That poor Specialist. They didn't do anything to deserve this. You have my sympathies.

Friendly reminder to anyone seeing this and thinking about cashing in your coins: consider letting your kids sort through them looking for less common coins first.  

They may not find anything particularly rare, but collecting with pocket change can be a relatively cheap hobby for kids to get into, there are guides online, and they can learn the history of the coins… all while developing a tactile/hands on relationship with money in a world where it’s digital most other places.

Coins hold their value pretty well and can become lifelong investments that get passed down through families, and something you can do together.


As someone who worked retail and at Apple… don’t do this. We had to juggle an average of 3 customers at once.

We had a douche canoe try this at the Best Buy I worked at in high school. Manager sent him to the bank on the other side of the mall. Guy complained that they charge a small fee to convert his change to bills, manager said “exactly, so why would you expect my staff to do it for free?”

Fun fact: You can’t buy anything for cash in an Apple store. You have to buy a gift card with the cash, that redeem that for the item.


That's not 100's of dollars. Max is two hundred and certainly not enough to buy an ipad.         
Unless there is more of frame.


Wow how annoying. Just use a coin master or something instead of wasting their time


At least have the decency to go to a bank and turn that into cash, instead of wasting some poor clerk’s time.


That poor poor closing employee. This happened to me once, it was only for a 20$ phone charger. I told the lady that I would have to count all this at the end of day and told her to go across the street to the bank to get cash instead. She understood the situation, went and came back in 5 minutes. 

Imagine having to count $800 in change when it’s time to leave. Fuck that.

I feel for the sales person. I once had a kid bring his hard saved pocket money in store to buy a stereo, might not sound like much but there was $39.95 worth of 5 & 10 cent coins I had to count.


My grandfather once did a rally call for half pennies to raise money for charity.

He raised about £700 in  coins and all I can remember is the smell.

Is this Canada?  Us quarters are mixed into those stacks.  Are they equivalent to something there?


Can you not weigh coins of a single type in Canada?

In the UK for example 20x£1 coins is 176g, 20x50p are 160g and 50x20p are 250g by design, making quick counting easier.

Shout out to Apple for accepting coinage. It’s legal tender. Walmart won’t even accept coins for life saving medication at their pharmacy.

I would trust a coin machine before I trusted two humans.


I used to work in an Apple store. An old dude walked in one day and purchased a decked out Macbook pro in dollar coins from the US mint. He used a hand truck to bring it in, and we went to the back and hand-counted it. His reason? At the time, the US mint had a promotion for free shipping on certain limited edition coins, and he was churning 2% PayPal credit card rewards by having the coins mailed to his house, then depositing the coins at his local bank to pay off the card. He told me 2x deliveries and deposits a week, and he was netting around $100 per week to supplement his fixed income.


I actually knew a bartender who paid for her vacation years ago with all her rolled change. Literally stacks of loonies and toonies.


I work at a small electronics business and this is not too uncommon. Honestly it's sorta fun when it happens


Did you drive the employee helping you loonie? 🤪


Someone still uses a piggy bank.

Calculate the area of the shadow inside of this poor girl’s mind.


Assuming the rows of coins don't go further out of the picture than the plastic bags in the bottom left, it looks a lot more like they were buying the pair of headphones than an iPad. By my calculation that's about $257.95  (give or take $16.50) .

Edit: only counting what's clearly on the actual photo, it's $236.45 ±2.25. (ambiguity in last stack of toonies, 4 or 5; last stack of nickels, 2 or 3; last stack of dimes, 7-10)


A car salesman told me recently that they had someone buy a $60,000 truck with fives and tens. Took a couple hours to count it all. He also said the money reeked, so they were likely pot growers.

She isn’t using an Apple Pencil!!!


I was just in a shop yesterday where it took the woman a fair amount of time to count about $3 in change. She grumbled and I made a joke about kids these days not being able to count change. 

She was kind of annoyed and said “ok you count it”, and I did. It took about 5 seconds. She grumbled that “At l least I got the same number as her”

I explained that it wasn’t a slant, young people really can’t count change like old people because it’s just not that common. I’m hardwired to see and group coins. I’m certainly not smarter than them, at least not because I can count change faster. 

Cash is important for privacy and portability. It’s going to be gone soon though, that much is clear. It will be one more step that erodes autonomy and freedom.


When I was a kid I bought an N64 with dollar coins that I had saved up. I didn’t know anything or understand I could go to the bank to change them for paper money. I marched into that EB Games and plopped a giant box down on the counter and requested an n64 and Mario 64. Those poor clerks. At least they made me count it all out and stack it for them. These were loose coins too.


Buy with coins.

Immediately request a cash refund.

Repeat until bored.


Guy actually did this and was proud enough to take a photo, common courtesy is lost on some


That’s some entitled attention seeking bullshit. Take those coins to the bank and turn them into bills like a normal person

Sorry, but how dumb is the personal there?
They could just send him to a bank where he can throw this in an automat and get banknotes back...


Why yes how else can I annoy a minimum wage person and be an asshole at the same time


Wouldn’t it have been easier and faster to deposit them with your bank teller tho?


I paid for a Sega Saturn when I was a kid in coins, $200. I had the courtesy to roll them. One of the proudest days of my youth. I hope that's what's going on here.

Seriously? How difficult would it have been just to go to a bank and exchange coins for bills as opposed to making Apple employees count out all that change. They have far better things to do..


Huh, I thought I heard that Apple stores stopped accepting cash


maybe this was a kid saving his change until they had enough for an ipad? coin container looks to be that spiderman cup

I would send the person away, direct them to a bank where they can get bank notes or have it put in their account so they can use a card. What a dick move


Either OP is a complete douche for being petty to the store employee or OP is a complete douche because he stole a picture someone else took and posted it as his own. Either way it sucks.


Gold bullion! Lol


Damn, are they paying in mixed currency? Quarters, gold pieces, pirate doubloons?


You'd think one could use the iPad to tally instead of writing on a piece of paper. lol


Mans out here solving the coin shortage crisis one purchase at a time


My parents owned beauty supply. My allowances were always in dollar coins. Guy at our local game stop knew I was buying games in coins as soon as I walked into it.


Yeah well, why not? It’s still money.


Step 2…set up Apple Pay.


Why is she using paper and not an Apple product lmao


I’m certain the person purchasing the iPad in all coins must have a really smelly home.


Speaking as someone who's been a cashier, fuck that customer. 

Seriously, they could have gone to any bank or used one of those Coinstar machines at the store. There's no call for this bullshit.


there’s english pounds and american coins… that’s annoying


Just watched someone get denied their prescription paying in coins. (On Reddit)


You could have put them in a coin machine, got an amazon gift card with 10% more value and bought it cheaper. But then, Karma would be not as good! So i guess you win.


Meh, whenever someone does that (or pays taxes w coins) they punish a poor clerk that did nothing to them.

Congratulations on your metallic savings, but save it up for an Infinite quantity of bread, coffee and newspapers, rather


Show this to the old guy who just got denied his prescription meds for trying to pay in coins !


If theyre such geniuses they should be able to do the math


Yall think this is funny but all this does is cause a domino effect of making the cashiers and the managers day harder. Cashier has to count those and waste time on you. At end of day, manager has to count the drawer up to two times to verify funds and cashier has to count it once again. All you're doing is causing hard working folks to have to stay passed their scheduled time in a job that already don't pay enough to deal with this shit.


Pretty sure there is a limit to how much you can pay with in coins.


Should have rolled them, laying them out is rude


But why? Is it because you’re evil spawn? I have stopped using paper or coin currency for a long time now. I only use digital payments


Why do people do this? It’s not cool; it’s a dick move. Count it yourself, roll it, take it to the bank, buy your phone w/ bills.


It blows my mind that I just saw a post of a pharmacist refusing to take coins for someone who needed their medication, while these apple employees will take coins for an ipad. That pharmacist should be fired.


Im sure they don’t get paid enough for this bullshit


I remember being in a store when a customer tried this.  He came in with literal buckets of rolled pennies to pay for his items.  The manager told him that the store refused to accept the payment.  The guy argued proclaiming the store **had to accept** the payment because it was legal tinder.  

Without missing a beat, the manager presented the guy with a print out of the federal and state statute that basically said the store was privately owned and could create their own policies regarding the type of payments they would and would not accept.  Apparently this was not his first rodeo.  

The guy raised hell and was forced to leave with his buckets of rolled pennies and without the products he was attempting to buy.  Funny enough, of the many customers who saw this only one attempted to back the guy.  But I honestly think the two of them knew each other.  Either way it was obvious what this customer's intent was.

Introducing the APPLE COIN

I once did this at a hobby shop to buy about $70 of model kits. It was mostly nickels and dimes.


The asshat can't put them in clear rollers or something? Nope, let's dig it all out and Scrooge McDuckit


Thanks for helping with the “national coin shortage” !!


I bought a $400 TV with change, but I did it with the help of a Coinstar machine. They don't charge a fee if you take the payout as an Amazon voucher.


this is meta. 

&#x200B;

shit, i can't say "meta" anymore can I


I love that they also used two US quarters


I saw a video where a guy did same, they were counting those coins for hour or more.


I manage a month long holiday art market each year. This year, someone bought a $350 painting with only $1 bills. (plus a few coins for tax) Thank God we got a new money counter this year or that would have been hell.


This made me laugh. Looks like when my daughter bought her own iPad with saved money out of her piggy bank. That stuff weighs a ton though.


There’s a video circulating around Reddit today of a guy who was refused his medication from a wal mart pharmacy for trying to buy his medication in rolled coins.


In 1998, I got my dad to take me to target first thing in the morning. I was the first person in line to buy Ocarina of Time and I paid for the whole thing with change I had been saving up for months. Worth it. It ended up being the best game of all time and I've probably hundred percent it 10 times since


Just don’t try to do this to get ur prescriptions filled


If MrBeast can buy a vehicle with pennies, then nobody should turn down coins ever


Why would this be punishing? I’m being paid to slowly count your coins and you’ll be sitting with me after hours before I confirm the amount?


Lmao homegirl has to write an invoice for it


That girl is fine though 👀


I did that one time with dollar bills in a Louis Vuitton


Using paper at an electronics store


Now try paying for your medication at Walmart and see how that goes


Money is money


At least apple saved on credit card transaction fees.


Looks like she just stole her Granddad's $1 coin collection.


Gotta do what you gotta do sometimes


That guy at Walmart is gonna be pissed when he sees this…


and then smashing it


Money is money


But Walmart won't let you use a roll of quarters to pay for medicine


Money is money


And counting them using a piece of paper instead of the iPad's calculator?!?!?!??!


Yea right cuz the workers in there deserve to go through that lol


Props to the Apple employee for being so well organized!


As a Canadian now living in Europe… I MISS THIS.

Not-so-fun fact: Euro currency doesn’t JUST have 1 cent coins… they also have 2 cent coins. IT. IS. HELL.


Loonie-palooza!


Only in Canada, pity....


The US has the dignity of having coin counting machines in most large grocery stores….does Canada have them?

Michigander here, I still have some of your pennies


Y'all just round up now? Gas finna be high asf


Shots fired, but your toonies are of legend too if I am too understand as well sir.


friend of my parents had a huge jar they threw change into.  For years.  Eventually they had a huge rolling party.  There were no machines to roll it them.   Everyone gave their best guess as to the total amount and the winner got $50.  In coins.   I don't remember how many dollars there were but it was a huge jar.


I paid for my original NES in like 1988 at Thrifty's Drug Store doing this. Still have it today in the box.


I had an uncle who bought just about everything he could from Canadian Tire. He then would take the CTC money and throw it in a drawer. Did that for years. 

I ended up staying with him in university. One weekend I opened his CTC stash and counted and bundled it up. He had near $300 in CTC money. This was in the late 80s, so more than $600 in today's money. He bought a bunch of tools with it.


A lot places don't accept rolled coins because they could be shorted.

And to the people saying that you need to take it to the bank rolled up, that a lie. I tried to changed my rolled up coins at the bank and they wouldn't let me. But they where more than happy when I brought my loose changed, they put it in a bag to count it on a coin machine which will sorted out for them. Then they deposit your money in the bank account.


I couldn't get the bank to take my unrolled coins


Probably less time constrained at the apple store.  Plus they have a giant table to use.  I'd gladly take the transaction and kill 30 minutes counting coins


You know what's more fucked?  Picking up your prescription after a root canal just to be behind the fuckface old man who decided to bring coins.  That's fucked.

It took her less time then it took her coworker to explain an iCloud subscription to an elderly lady


Things like this are a 50/50 depending on how your day is already going. Already dealt with too many idiots? This could be what makes you snap and go "fuck this shit".

Also taking a photo of this poor employee while the customer watches this person count all their gross change is a shitty thing to do on top of it all.


As someone who worked in retail, I would love something like this. Anything that breaks is monotonous work is welcome.


Same here, I work in retail and I like to count change for pastime. I like to help customers get rid of their change when they don’t really need it. Of course, that’s if there’s no people. And anyways, it’s better than having to flatten those bills folded into god knows what.


At my job they’d be cracking the whip, telling me I’m not counting fast enough, I should be checking work mail & reading negative feedback & helping a new client all at the same time.


[Aye, similar here in Australia;](https://banknotes.rba.gov.au/legal/legal-tender/)if you’re paying in silver coins (5c, 10c, 20c, 50c) you can only spend up to $5 before it’s not actually considered legal tender. Same as the $1 and $2 coins, you can only use up to ten times the face value of the coins before the merchant can refuse it as non-legal tender. So you can pay up to $20 in coins if they’re all $2 coins but no more.


I was just coming to say this. Most stores will have a bit of a margin of acceptance thought. I’ll usually accept up to $50 in toonies where it’s equal to a full roll and not /that/ many coins, but I wouldn’t usually take more than a roll (or maybe two, depending on coin type)


They don’t have to accept any number of coins or even bills in a retail transaction. Legal tender is for settling debts and government stuff like taxes. In a retail transaction no debt is created and the seller is free to dictate whatever payment methods they are willing to accept. Of course not accepting Canadian banknotes and reasonable numbers of coins will generally put you at a disadvantage.


even if its legal tender, they dont have to sell you it

legal tender only means something when settling debts


In the US there is no obligation to accept any form of currency for a transaction/purchase. They have a right to refuse service to you if they don't accept the denomination, etc. But if you have a debt, then they have to accept certain amounts of coins.


From the spiderman cup we see there it definitely looks like money saved up by a kid so I doubt they were going to be assholes and not accept that money


Ayo i used to work at one of these stores in the 00s and kids would come up with their literal saved Pennies to buy computers or iPods. 

I’ll gladly count it out with them. We weren’t making commission lol


Having worked in retail, I would gladly count coins as it beats standing around contemplating my life.


Except this is just a picture with no backstory. It could be a kid or just anyone that’s saved up from change they’ve gathered. Could even be someone just emptying the quarters for some coin operated washer/dryers they own. Assume good faith. If the image was someone paying a parking ticket with change, you can probably assume it was intentional, but fuck parking tickets and meter maids.


Thank you exactly


money is money


Exactly. This doesn't hurt Apple, they still get paid. It just hurts the employees who have to deal with this shit before they can go home.


Not sure why you think this is “fucking” the employees. I’d be happy to get away from the tech illiterates that infest the Apple stores to just chill for five minutes and count some change.


Fr. Just giving Apple money


Because if he did that he wouldn’t be able to post it to reddit like an edgelord champ and farm karma like a total cunt


Because counting machines, that are not in banks, take up to 10% of the total.

This American tourist almost burst into tears at Shoppers in BC a few months ago - my monthly out of pocket and co pay for prescriptions is about $800 US.  I had to get a certified COVID test for TravelCan/ArriveCan (randomly assigned at Customs) and was in the queue behind people sharply asking the pharmacy tech that their co pay was always $2 CAD before, why is it $3 CAD now?


That’s why I posted this. This photo was from 2015, but I figured it would be relevant now.
It appears that most the people commenting on this post are on the pharmacist’s side and think it’s nice to refuse change


I was going to say, "no", but looked it up. There isn't a federal statute requiring that businesses accept cash as payment and that they're free to develop their own policies regarding what they will accept, including which denominations.


They could say no almost anywhere. But this canadian coins, this is like paying in $1 and $2 bills if you're american.


In Canada they could too. But they wanted the sale. Apple likes money more then most other companies


When you're paid hourly who cares.  I'd double or triple count it to make sure its all there


In my experience it's common to see 1 american coin per every 100 and they are usually accepted at Canadian value. The common denominations are also the same size, for reasons that I'm not sure of but we can assume for interoperability. Fun fact, the only time i visited the USA, I paid for a coffee and there was a Canadian dime in the mix. The coffee clerk was like, "this is Canadian..." And slid it back. I just looked at her blankly because this would never happen in Canada if there was american coins in the mix.
Edit: my phone apparently didn't capitalise the word American. Sorry, meant no disrespect.


US coin is often used interchangeably with Canadian coin (even though it shouldn’t be accepted in that way, technically speaking)

Realistically, if you saved and rolled all the US quarters you come across and take it to the bank, you could make a “profit” of $3/roll based on the exchange rate. 

Most people don’t care about the 30% exchange on such small amounts, but it adds up over time. 

There’s likely hundreds of thousands of USD presently circulating in Canada in the form of coinage.


Yeah that's definitely common!


>I'm seeing a few US quarters

Yep, OP clearly overpaid.


My mom used to work at a bank... whenever this would happen it would always be some story like a 17 year old kid stealing his grandpa's coin collection. They'd take all these old/rare coins and turn them into the bank for face value


Gotta buy rolls 

05 cent rolls 99 cents
10 cent rolls 99 cents
25 cent rolls 99 cents
1 dollar rolls 99 cents
2 dollar rolls 99 cents

At least 1-2hrs to roll

5+tax + 2hrs wasted

Being asshole = free (priceless see picture)


Once when I was about ten, my parents gave me a big change jar. My friend and I were stoked and bought a delivered pizza with bags of carefully counted pennies. 

We made sure to tip well.


I’m pretty sure both the Apple employee and bank employee will get paid for their time counting coins.

Canadian coins, we have 2$ (silver with gold colored middle) 1$ (all gold colored) 25c (silver large) 10c (silver smallest) and 5c (silver medium)


Thank you so many ppl here cheering this douche on not thinking about the fact that the only person this inconveniences is the poor person that had the bad luck to serve him


What an actual piece of shit! So glad you were able to fuck with him back and defeat him though!


So Canadian


They knew, I just asked nicely.


They didn't decide to be nice, they decided (like most high volume stores) that coins are always good as it gives your drawer change without having to fuck around with the cash office.


It’s an old photo


I'd argue only if they work by commission or have sales quotas. When I used to work as a regular cashier not only did I not mind this kind of thing, I enjoyed weird transactions that shook up the monotony. The people who really get annoyed are the other customers who may have to wait longer because a till is effectively out of service for a while.


I’m guessing you’re the one who had to count it or?


Depends on where you live.

In the US, and worked at multiple banks, we would NOT take loose coins like this. You have to have them rolled for us.

However, we would just give you wrappers and you could do it yourself.


When I worked retail I would much rather count change than explain how an ICloud subscription works to a customer.


When my jar is filled to the top I buy myself a prize. 
I also bought a piano this way once


Toonies, Loonies, Quarters, Nickles and Dimes. Canadian.


She knew but didn’t mind.


Like 4 years ago lol


Yeah it was from 2015. I decided to post it now in response to the guy getting turned away from the pharmacy.


Bahahaha that’s wild!


Apple never turns down a sale ever


The manager came out and helped


I do believe you mean life.


Haha now that’s evil


Everyone is pitying the worker for having to count, and yet you did it for fun


They would be rolled already, no?


First thing I thought of. WTF?


This is a super old picture it seems


Very good!


Yeah I don’t know how he wasn’t called out for that. This obviously isn’t his photo

Just a little karma thief


It's the same currency.


Banks don't generally exchange money for noncustomers


All Canadian coins Bud. Silver are quarters, bronze are loonies ($1) and the double coloured ones are toonies($2)


My bank still has the counting machine. You put the coins in, then it counts them and gives you a receipt with the total amount on it. It even breaks it up into how many of each coin you had! You bring that to a teller and they give you cash :)


iRony *


My grandma kept a big glass jar we would fill with change, and whenever it got full we’d take it to the bank or the grocery, send it through the counting machine, and then she’d take us to Toys-R-Us to buy toys with the cash. That was a great way to generate that habit too, I still do it now in my 30s.


Retail stores don't generally take coins to the bank; they give them to customers as change.

Retail stores generally get rolls of coins from the bank.


Apple store doesn’t really have lines. It’s just a free for all in there


She was unsure, and called the manager.
Manager said “hell yeah we have a sales target!” And brought out a pen and paper.


I sorted them in zipper bags before hand.


I sorted them first so it was under 10 mins


Apple didn’t become the richest company in the world by turning down sales


The whole interaction was under 15 minutes


In the Netherlands no store carries the 1 or 2 cents any more, except Aldi. Most stores don't accept them anymore either, except probably Aldi.


A number of European countries have phased them out. 

They're still legal tender, but they're no longer in active circulation.


Australia had that and stopped using them. I think we also recently stopped using the 5 cent coin too


as someone living in europe (NL) I haven't used cash in... a long time. Everything here gets rounded to 5cts though if you insist on using cash.


Growing up in Russia, we had 1, 5, 10, and 50 kopeck coin denominations, 100 of which made up 1 ruble. For reference, 1 ruble was worth 0.03 CAD in 2012, and it's obviously even weaker now. It was such a pain to carry those worthless coins around, and moving to Canada made me appreciate high denomination coins so much...


Not-so-fun fact as well: making the 1cent coin cost more than the coin itself.


In Finland we have never used the 1 and 2 cent coins. Everything gets rounded up or down to the nearest 5 cents. So if something costs 5,97€, I would pay 5,95€.


They're redundant in Ireland now


Im just waiting for them to phase out nickels and dimes now. Realistically who uses anything less than a quarter anymore.


No love for Toonies?


Red Rose Tea slogan. I haven't heard that in a while.


There are actually limits on how much you can pay in coins in Canada. A vendor can refuse accepting that as payment: https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52/page-1.html

Limitation

(2) A tender of payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

(a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;

(b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;

(c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;

(d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and

(e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.


In some, yes.


Yeah. But they take a 10% cut. Here it would have cost over $50!


Oh yea. But we are assholes


They used to me more common. Now very few people pay with cash or coins in cities so it's less common.


If they don't like change.  You would think they would be in favour of removing the penny


Dad owned his own business and he would put all his change in a big glass 5 gallon water jug when he got home. We’d count it out every year during Christmas and that is what we would use to take our family vacations with. He managed to fill that jug near full every year too.


This feels like irl landing on monopoly free parking


I worked at CTC for years.   The amount of people who would bring in hundreds of dollars in CTC money.  Each bill crumpled into a big bag… having to uncrumple and count all those 5cent bills… don’t miss those days.

If you have one of those claw staple removers you can just clip the side of a roll and check if you're being frauded without unrolling it or letting the coins loose.

(ETA: you can get clear plastic rollers too! They're loads easier to verify).

Funny enough, I worked at a bank that required coins to be rolled and that's how we checked 'em upon deposit.


See that's messed up its legal tender they are a bank and dang ol coin star machines take what like 12% now a days. A lot of people keep change to cash in they should of taken it suck man I feel for ya...as I look at my big jug of change LOL


At an Apple Store, sure. Anywhere else? This would’ve slowed down the entire business from operating.


My aunt, bless her soul, still won't accept that Windows 10 isn't the reason her ipad's email broke.   :D 

The windows 10 bad press was so bad that it even ruined ipads!


You see there's this thing called the cloud. It magically saves files and you can take them anywhere and always access them. 

You mean I can take my computer with me? Can I still use the windows apps from anywhere? 

No, no, you can't use the apps but you can download the files

You mean I have to download them? I thought they were in this cloud. 

Yes they are in the cloud but that just means you can download them from anywhere.

Then why do I need the cloud. Why can't I just take my phone or computer with me?

The cloud is backed up in case you lose your phone or laptop. 

Backed up? Why would they need to be backed up? They're stored on the cloud right? 

And on and on in circles.


The worst customer service interaction I had was when a middle aged woman and her elderly mother came in.

The daughter had her deceased husbands phone with her, and she understandably wanted to access it for photos and such. Me, a human, wanted to give her the best information I could. I worked for a cellular carrier, so all I could do is give advice.

The mother was convinced I could just get into the phone. I tried explaining that since it was an apple product, there was no way I could just “get in”.

While explaining how I couldn’t, she insisted that I just wouldn’t.

I asked her who her internet provider was. After that, I asked her if she brought a laptop to them she forgot the password to, if they’d be able to get in. She didn’t hesitate to point out my flawed logic, but it was lost to her the analogy.

I tried explaining that if entry level people had the ability to get past encryption, bad actors would win… 

Needless to say, doors were slammed and I was cussed out in front of the whole store.


"does the cloud ever rain?"


Oh god fucking damn it you just brought back memories from when I worked at the Apple Store.    

It’s true for some reason. Old people walk up to you when you’re on the sales floor and start asking you these incredibly confused questions about what iCloud is and what it does, and after half an hour of explaining they still don’t get it, and it’s time for me to go on break, but I can’t get away from them because they’re aggressively confused


I much prefer this than the always nasty booby bills.


Imagine going to eat a restaurant and a group of tik tokers pay their meal in coins and every server now has to count nickles and dimes while you;re just sitting there...


Exactly this douche canoe isn’t funny or edgy he’s just a cunt making the poor person, who had the bad luck to serve him days harder


But like couldn’t they deposit the saved coins in a bank and then pay by card? 
Banks are equipped to count vast amounts of change, I imagine


This pic was from 2015, and posted in response to a popular video of a pharmacy refusing a man’s coins. This is my first, and likely last post.


No they don’t. There are a few free ones still out there but all the ones I’ve seen let you get gift cards without taking a cut of your money.

when canada got rid of their smaller coins (under 5 cents? can’t remember) someone tried to pay for their order at starbucks with all canadian coins at the store i worked at in kentucky. when i told her it wasn’t valid currency she said “but we don’t use them anymore so what do i do with them?” and then dumped them all in the tip jar. which was not a tip because it wasn’t valid currency. sigh.


Canadian pennies are still circulating in the States, even if Canadians don't use them.  After all, who cares enough to look closely?


Ugh. That’s sad


I worked in multiple banks. Not a single one charged you for rolls for your coins.

Only stipulation with a lot of coins was that you had to roll them yourself.

I've never seen a bank charge for wrappers for coins.


You do realize it isn't the action itself, it is the concept behind the action?

Normal people don't typically go out to purposefully inconvenience others. I have never woken up and thought, "I'm gonna go buy an iPad using only small coins today!"

It is a waste of everyone's time, including the buyer's.

…the kid can get to the Apple Store, but not to the bank where they can exchange rolled coins for cash?


No, I’m just a considerate person. It doesn’t take much to understand it’s a dick move.


Oh, I'm sorry, I worked as a bank teller in Brazil and we had machine coin counters in almost every branch, although they almost were never used because of things like credit cards and wire transfers nowadays.

They were ancient piece of technology by the way.


I can guarantee, even though they might have been nice to you, everyone in this pic thought you were an asshole.


Take it to the bank and get it in bills and don’t be an asshole to retail employees. No one is excited you filled up your piggy bank.


You didn’t even get all the stacks of coins in frame. We know you’re taking a picture of the girl XD


Well in the US, Walmarts heck even banks have machines to exchange coins into bills.


How much is the coin worth that has a center coin and outer order? Panama has $1 coins like that.


Loonie and toonie??? Is that a joke?


In that case, sorry for calling you an asshat mate! Zip bags are a smart alternative to rollers.


In Australia we stopped 1 and 2 cents in 1992. They are going to take 5 cents out soon because they say it costs more than 5c to make each one.


Ah yes, the Netherlands. Always a step ahead…. Unfortunately I’m east of you with the penny-pinching Germans.


Can you choose to not accept legal tender?


wow Im an idiot. i though Aldi's was just for America.


Hey I’m just curious, completely unrelated to the post but does Aldi do the coin in the cart thing over there too? They’re still pretty new in the USA


>Most stores don't accept them anymore either

I'm not from the Netherlands, but that doesn't sound feasible. Legal tender is legal tender. Do you have a source proving otherwise?


Assuming it gets used more than once, it doesn't really matter


Only if paying with cash. If you use a card the numbers aren't rounded. In many stores prices are rounded to the nearest 5 cents but it's not a requirement and I notice especially supermarkets have prices ending in odd numbers.


That’s the reasonable approach… unfortunately I’m among the penny pinching Germans. They want all their change haha


CBC has a story today about how rising inflation makes it time to get rid of the nickel.


My parents only buy red rose so we say it all the time. I have been picked on, in jest, because I don't like Tetley.


I know I used to use coin star machines and they would take a cut unless you chose like a giftcard as payment and then it was 1:1.  I used to do payouts for Amazon gift cards since I often bought things off Amazon anyway so that way I wasn't losing any money in the conversion. 

It's been years since I've used one of those machines so not sure if that's a thing anymore but it was a good option at the time.


You’re kidding, coin counting machines take a cut?!?! Jeeze


My aunt had one two in her office on the second floor with no elevator. Thing weighed like 150 pounds and we had to empty it because it was too awkward and heavy to carry down the stairs.


My dad did the same. We had four children and when vacation came we would count it out and everyone got 1/4 to spend on anything we wanted. Trashy souvenir stuff, food, rental motorcycle or rafts for the beach, whatever. About $150 each in the early 70’s was quite the chunk of change to waste. Haha


It used to be actual 'money' printed by the Canadian Bank Note Company for use only in Canadian Tire Stores and gas stations. 

It was given back to customers as a 1.4% (the rate changed over time) rebate on the amount spent in the stores.  So spend $100 at the store and get $1.40 back as Canadian Tire 'money'.

https://media3.allnumis.com/1189_808233743348093L.jpg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tire_money

They still have the program, but it's mostly on a more typical loyalty rewards card now.

Edit. It looks like the rebate rate at the time would have likely been about 3%, so to get $300 accumulated, he would have spent about $10k in the store over the years.


By context, it appears Canadian Tire had a points program for every dollar you spent, you got whatever CTC amount credited to you by a voucher. This seems to be before the modern keytag with a bar code used now or a modern computer system to track. 

That’s just what I got out of it 🤷‍♂️


When I worked retail, our policy was to open and count any rolls. It's not efficient, but that's what the manager said.


Oh no, not their record profits


Really windows 10? That was the good one, windows 8 was the most recent bad version


You’ve done this before


Sounds like Peter explaining Pied Piper to the focus group


“Ma’am..”


No but sometimes it leaks nudes


The concept of "cloud" seems to be absolutely unfathomable to about 50% of over 50 year olds.


New policy, employees will only accept booby bills if you let them fish them out themselves. 

Oh look at that, suddenly almost everyone has a purse or wallet.


I don’t think it’s a “fuck Apple” thing. The change would only take a few minutes to count and there are enough people out there who just save theirs and then go spend it like this.


Bruh its still money. Apple dont give a fuck.


My US-based bank account won’t accept coins at all unless you roll them.

And then after you roll them, the teller breaks open the rolls and counts them each by hand.

It’s absolutely asinine.


Kids don’t have bank accounts. Someone collecting change might mot have one either. The only option at that point would be one of those coin machines, however they take a fee for converting coins to cash.


Coinstar takes out 7.5% of your total, or if you buy a VERY SPECIFIC gift card (Literally like red robin, lyft, or the most generic is Instacart) so there absolutely is a ton of fees.   


However, banks will do this for free.


Where in Canada still has free coin counters? After the lawsuits?

Thwarting repairability and protecting their hypocritical corporate image


We only got rid of the penny. Technically you could have exchanged that tip into us currency. The coins are still legal. (Not that it would have been worth your time)


Now who is the asshole/dick now...

All you upvoters. A kid saves their money for a long time and all you do is complain


Oh ok! :D


Oh yeah, coin counters still exist, we just didn't have them unless they happened to be in a branch (you didn't really order new ones) and we still wouldn't really use them for customers.

It takes too much time doing it for every customer that comes in with tons and tons of loose coins.


Coinstars at Walmart charge massive fees


Legal tender.


That's a toonie. Aka 2$ coin.


Look it up. Very real and yes it is funny.


When the dollar coin came out in the 80s it featured a picture of a loon, and so it quickly gained the nickname "loonie". When the 2 dollar coin came out in the 90s, folks just rolled with it and called it the "toonie". Neither are official names. Even though both coin regularly feature different images on the tails side, the default relief for the one dollar coin is the loon, and a polar bear for the 2 dollar coin.


We stopped with 5c years ago in NZ.


And will they take out 10c, 25c, and 50c when they get too expensive?


Wer den Pfennig nicht ehrt, ist des Talers nicht wert!

Edit: grammar


Duestch Mr Krabs.


I already assumed, because of Aldi. Haha


The Canada Currency Act actually allows for limitations on how much coin must be accepted as legal tender.

(2) A tender of payment in coins referred to in subsection (1) is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

    (a) forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;

    (b) twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;

    (c) ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;

    (d) five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and

    (e) twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.


no way, they're German, and they were at one point the largest grocery franchise in the world (they might still be)

and allegedly the owner is brothers with the owner of trader joes, but I've never gotten confirmation on that rumor


From america so my response doesn't matter much, but does it matter that legal tender is legal tender.  It's not a debt so no reason the transaction has to happen.


From Ireland where we also got rid on 1c & 2c. 

You can still use 1c or 2c but as everything is rounded to the nearest 5c, you'll never get 1c or 2c change and the coins you handed over are now out of circulation.


I used to walk into Commerce Bank and use those machines that seemed like it was meant for kids and their piggy banks.

They got bought out by TD but the machines remained


If you count them at a bank that you’re not a member of or if you go to somewhere like Walmart and use their machine.


They are externally owned. Like the local grocery store have one, operated by coinstar. They take [11.9%](https://www.coinstar.ca/HowitWorks) processing fee! The machine print a ticket that you then exchange at a register while paying for your goods or at the customer service desk.


Pretty sure all the one's I've seen take a 25% cut.


My grandmother had one of those old glass water bottles, even empty that thing was heavy.  She filled it with pennies, and had started a new jug.  I feel like it weighed a couple hundred pounds when full.

Someone in the family, probably my older brother, snuck into her house one night and stole it.  They must have gotten tired of dragging it about a quarter of the way through the house, and flipped it on the side to roll it out.  My uncle and I followed the trail of pennies out to where the thief had parked their car.

I wish my brother had any form of honesty in him, I'm really curious about how much money that bottle netted him.  Knowing him, he probably didn't even count it and just traded in for a five dollar crack rock.


This has gone back and forth through the years.  Some branches would say write your name and account number or put an address label on them.  However, privacy issues ensued if they were given back to customers.   But you could rip the bank off by putting washers in the rolls.  The only mistake free way to do this would be to open and verify each roll, however time consuming it is.  The change machines now are great and cut out this element of fraud, however, some of them take a fee out.


No. This means every task I do as a closing manager will take longer and I will have to stay later. That is, of course, if someone paid for a large order in this absurd amount of change.


I mean more so a pain in the ass for the slightly above minimum wage employees.


If I remember correctly, telemetry and privacy issues was  a good reason for win10 bad reputation.


Well, and Windows 11.


Did tech support on my campus when in college for computer science. Dealing with old professors was a challenge.


You mean Richard?


I’ve been wondering for a long time why ATMs don’t have coin deposits. They have counters at grocery stores that are accurate these days, why not attach those to ATMs and stop making up pay fees?


Suppose for a very brief moment: this is a kid

A kid *can* go to a bank and exchange the coins. That's what banks do. If not, kid can go around the block exchanging coins for dollar bills. Not only is it easier for the kid to carry, it's also much safer since coins are heavy and if it somehow dropped to their feet kid would be pretty fucked


Coinstar in Canada (where this photo was taken) charges 11% and doesn't offer gift cards. Definitely not worth it.


banks will only do it for free if you roll the coins.


> *adds a small step*

WHAT AN ASSHOLE KEEPING MONEY FROM A CHILD

Lol ok Karen.

And OP isn’t a kid and this isn’t his photo. He’s a karma thief


Not sure how asking about the logistics of what you said makes me an asshole but ok lol. If a kid can get to the Apple Store to buy an iPad, they have the means to go to the bank first to get bills. I think that would be a great teaching moment for the kid, that hey maybe getting some cash in place of the coins would be kind & make things easier for the Apple employee who processes the iPad transaction.


Don't you just let them do it themselves and the machine prints you a ticket with the cash value on it? That's what my bank does.


Banks are free.


Also not required to be accepted for purchases. Most places don’t reject cash though except in special or extreme circumstances


For all DEBTS, not all purchases.


Cool thanks!


They'll have to start making the 25c before they discontinue it.

Smartarsery aside, we've got 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c coins, as well as $1 and $2 coins.

Rising metal costs means the 5c might soon stop either being manufactured or circulated entirely, but for the others I'd say they'd look at changing the composition before they remove the physical currency.

I'd like to think they'd be better changing the composition of the 5c, but I'm honestly not sure what's possibly cheaper and still corrosion-resistant without reducing the diameter of the actual coin.. and it's already our teeniest by a fair margin.


I feel like this is the way currency is heading. Eventually we'll need $200 and $300 bills.


The "it costs more than 5¢ to make it" is just an explanation to shut up stupid people.  You don't make coins to increase the amount of money you have.  If that were a valid reason, the same argument would prevent you from making anything but your country's highest denomination of currency.  Why make a $1 bill if it is barely cheaper than making a $100 bill?  Because that's a stupid comparison.

Now "you can earn more than 5¢ by melting one down" might be a valid reason to stop making them.


Yeah, probably?


*des Talers

Can't be accurate without 1ct. and 2ct. coins, I guess.


Big Meaty Klaus


I love the dramatic difference between 5 cents and 1 cent, like "I know you want to be petty, just don't" lmao


Lmao yup


This so much this the only person who is disadvantaged by this is the poor person who lucked out and had to serve you


That’s correct. In Germany, Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd have been financially and legally separate since 1966, although both divisions' names may appear as if they were a single enterprise with certain store brands or when negotiating with contractor companies. 

In the United States, both Nord and Süd operate, although the "Trader Joe's" name is used for Nord stores there.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi


It's not a rumor, this is an easily substantiated fact: Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud operate in Germany and internationally; in America Aldi Nord operates Trader Joe's and Aldi Sud operates as Aldi.

Literally all you'd have to do it look at the Wikipedia page for Aldi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldi


im just a stupid Amerikan arnt I


So a store in the US could, for example, refuse to accept US dollars, and accept only Euros instead, and that would be legal, because "it's not a debt"?


Thank you for the explanation. I have no idea why I got downvoted for asking a question. That's not the same as "stores not accepting them anymore" though, so I was right.


If you are buying items in Walmart using coins, don't use coinstar just use the self checkout. I get rid of all my unwanted change there, and they don't take a cut. It does take a while for the machine to count it all out though. 

 I have paid for upwards of $20 in groceries entirely in coins. If there's a limit on this I haven't reached it yet. 

You can also pay for a portion of your purchases in coins, and the balance in card or cash if you don't quite have enough. I've done this as well.


I was thinking they meant for any coin counting machine a bank or shop (like apple) may purchase and use or the like. Charging at a Walmart or whatever is predatory but sort of what I’d expect.


Windows 11 isn't bad. Its just unnecessary.


Whats wrong with 11?


r/usernamechecksout


Or who gives a shit, it is a little kid?


Commerce Bank (years ago, before they were acquired by TD) had a machine- you’d just dump your piggy bank in. Good times as a kid


Some of them have counting machines open to the public.  You have to call.

I'm aware of two in my area.  They move the machine around every few months but if you call they'll tell you which branch has it.


Weird, not sure what banks you go to but the ones I've worked with refuse rolled coin entirely due to scams, and will break it in front of you into a coin tray.


>black toonie in honour of Her Majesty’s passing

mine isn't. don't remember exactly but i think it's 10%. USA


If you can find one that has a machine or are willing to take them. This is surprisingly difficult, even when you find one you’ll need an account there or they’ll politely tell you to fuck off.


We just issued a black toonie in honour of Her Majesty’s passing. It looks really good.


Plastics! The future is in plastics!


I’ll gladly have a wallet of $300 tricky Dick fun bills


Absolutely right


don't worry, i'm also a stupid american


Im probably embarising for my ancestors that traveled to America from Poland and Germany to escape H\*tler


Aside from your question about euros, payment of debt is fundamental to the definition of legal tender. Legal tender doesn’t mean “national currency”. I know anecdotally that businesses in Canada sometimes won’t take 50s or 100s and definitely won’t take pennies. Even rarely businesses won’t take cash at all and have gone to a purely debit/credit system. A quick google also tells me there’s no federal US statute that a business must take all forms of currency. I don’t know if a US business “could” take euros, but why would they? It would be a completely needless complication. Whereas refusing to accept certain coins or bills is, if anything, simplifying things beyond customer complaints


They broke the easy audio output switcher unnecessarily. So it's kinda both.


I want to get one of those, but I never use cash so that might be hard....


Don’t worry, all Americans are stupid


Do you have any links to precedents where this was taken to a court and the court said what you just did? In my country lots of businesses also act like you described, but I highly doubt it would hold in court if someone bothered to sue them.


You never use money? Do you barter?


I think I used cash once this year. It was to buy some flowers from a little unmanned stand on the side of the road. Most farm stands around here take debit if there's someone there, or e-transfer if unmanned. A few even sell eggs or cheese from a vending machine. I probably won't see a black toonie for years .

Apple is just knocking it out of the park with iPads. The last "bad" iPad was the iPad 3. Just a really reliable media consumption/decent productivity device which I hope apple keeps improving on as the competition isn't really out there to push them.


I just upgraded to this from an original Air (16gb!!) that I purchased on it's launch day back in 2013, and I'm loving how snappy this new model is coupled with iOS 11. I'm very happy to have a relatively up-to-date couch + flight device back. 

Do you think Apple will continue to spec bump this device on yearly basis (keeping it behind the Pro line of course)? 


The price point is fantastic for such a capable device. My girlfriend has a 2017 and it's more than enough for everything she needs to do at home. We picked up a nice BT keyboard for it and she does some work at home sometimes as well.

I love my iPad Pro and I definitely take advantage of the advantages it has over the regular iPad, but for most people the iPad is enough.


This sub will still complain that its not an iPad pro. 


I've started to transition over to Apple recently because I just don't have the time for the subpar hardware offerings of Android. It's sad, but while Apple offers less functionality for certain use cases, their hardware has a standard that I can trust will let me use the product for 3-4 years with no issues.


So if I don't currently have an iPad but I would maybe like to get one, is there any reason I shouldn't just buy the 2017 for $250 instead of the 2018 for $330? I don't *THINK* I care about the pencil, and would mostly be used for youtube, social media, and some gaming (PUBG Mobile/Maybe Fortnite). 

Seems like a good deal to just go for the 2017 if I decided to get one in the near future.


My 2017 iPad has been great. I wish I didn't get the 32GB version though, so I *might* trade up for the 128GB 2018 iPad.

The biggest competition for the new iPad is the discounted 10.5" iPad Pro that is $499 at Micro Center. Tough call!


My Mini 2 is showing its age. I'm really tempted by this, simply for the pencil support, but I'm still holding out hope for a pencil enabled Mini.


Was really hoping for an updated Mini, too.

Still debating on the $299 Mini (128GB) from Walmart vs. a $429 iPad (128 GB).  Mostly read stuff, browse news, Twitter, Reddit, etc. but do play the occasional game.  Only thing stopping me from the Mini is that it's so dated.  Having said that, use my iPad Air 2 all day and notice no lag/slowness at all...

I got this purely for the Apple Pencil as I study architecture, I’ve been looking at the pro for months but I couldn’t justify paying so much for something I know I wouldn’t use all the time as I have a MBP too, and I think it works great and the non-laminated screen really doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would as I’m just exporting most of my drawings and sketches anyways! 


How long has it been since the iPad *wasn't* the best tablet under $500?


God I really want one. I was waiting for a cheap iPad with decent internals. I don’t care about the pencil and keyboard.

BUT! Getting an iPhone X may have ruined me. Idk if I can go with an iPad that has no Face ID, uses a home button vs gestures, and doesn’t have a sexy screen. Methinks I’ll be shelling out for a pro when they’re updated


[deleted]


I'm still using the original iPad 1 to read comics, Netflix, Youtube and Spotify.
It's still rocking iOS 5 and the battery lasts ages (much better than my recent Surface).


Just like they said in the video, Apple has absolutely no competiton when it comes to tablets. I feel like these devices can be pushed much more, but it's a smart move.


It shows how much Apple has the tablet game on lock.  They can release a new iPad that just upgrades the CPU and supports the Pencil and they still have a home run.

Android phones are great and have a bunch of features I wish the iPhone did.  But I just can’t even consider an Android tablet unless price was my main if not only concern.  There’s just no competition there.


ugh really wish the ipad mini would get a refresh. There are some of us out here in the world who love them


I have the original iPad Air 1. I find it unusable because it's so slow and Safari pages constantly refresh. 


More like the only tablet under $500 which is worth using cause nothing else has apps optimized for the big screen 


Under 500, Apple brand, apple long lasting quality, iOS operating system. Can’t really complain unless it shows any problem.


This worked out well, been considering a iPad and when this came out the 2017 model has gone on sale for $250 so i jumped on it. Not using it for anything outside of media consumption so no need for the A10. Only shame is i use Android phones so cant use the same ecosystem 


I’m really on the fence on this. I already have a rMBP and an iPhone X. Would it be overkill if I buy one of these along with an Apple Pencil ? (I’m a student btw) 


is 32gb enough for ipad? new to apple


The Verge can't say good things about Apple products without including some sort of sting in the tail. I guess they think they're keeping Apple honest, although I think it's Nilai Patel's irresistible urge to mock EVERYTHING. 


How is it better than iPad Air 2? Just by supporting Apple Pencil? 


I still use my air that I got in 2014 for my high school graduation, iPads are tough machines. I'll be getting a new one for my new job in a few months and I'll still keep this one around because of how well it still works.


Is this the same shell as the previous 9.7-inch iPad Pro? Looking for options for my older 9.7-inch iPad Pro for smart covers. I’m hoping now they’ll be selling them in the stores since they bumped up the smaller iPad Pro to 10.5-inch. 


I have seen this comment in a couple reviews and I don’t understand what it means, “It has a visible air gap...” Anyone know? I am still using iPad 3 but since its upgrade days are over I am more concerned about security. This new one may be the one to get. 


I still use my iPad 4. My Note phone has replaced any real need for a tablet, so it just remains as a kitchen/dining room device. 


>It’s too bad that nothing else comes close, because maybe that competition would have inspired Apple to make something a little better.

Well put, Verge. Apple leads the tablet market. They could have done better at this price point, but if the only tablet worth buying is an iPad why lower margins for a better product?


I just received mine last Friday after my Galaxy Note 10.1 kicked the bucket. 

It's an iPad, that's really about it. Nothing special, but if you're just consuming media you get a lot for the $329 price tag. 

The reflective display hasn't been a problem, even when the brightness on the display is set low or on Night Mode. I've not once seen my reflection in any lighting condition. 

The A10 processor is snappy. 

The battery life is phenomenal. 


First Gen 9.7 iPad Pro or 2018 iPad??


Well.... whats New?!?


What are the main reasons to get a Pro over the new iPad? Considering getting one. Probably will mostly be for reading, internet browsing, note taking, videos etc. 


I bought the 2017 128gb iPad from Costco for 299. I only use it while in the kitchen and when I travel to download Netflix offline. The battery is amazing on it, granted it's brand new.


I bought a 2017 iPad just before Christmas last year, (had to spend some funds), now I wished I had waited a little while.

Not that I don't like the 2017 iPad, it's nippy, has all the features I use, but Apple Pencil support could have been useful.


Is the new iPad (2018) compatible with the Smart Keyboard, or is that only for the iPad Pro?


I m still running the ipad 1 32gb gsm+ wifi on “ios 6” and that thing will kill ya ASS any day





Most apps dont work but i dont use it for apps it’s jailbroken untethered and m lovin it ❤️


What competition is there?


I own a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 7 Plus, but tablet wise I have a samsung. 
  
Is it as good as an iPad? No but I use it and won’t move to Apple for a tablet simply because it’s my travel media centre and until such time as I can legitimately side load apps on to an iPad it’s not replacing either my laptop or my Samsung. 
  
If they really want to put tablets as potential laptop replacements they need the same flexibility and not contain them behind their walled garden.


iPad Mini Pro pls. i can never go bigger than the Mini. perfect tablet for me. 


I bought the iPad 5 about six months ago and now I wish I had waited. How much to trade it in for an iPad 6?


Does it come with a bag of Tim Cook’s farts in the box?  


If I could run a basic dev environment on an iPad it would kick ass. It’s the only thing stopping me from getting one.


Probably better than a used Microsoft surface in the same price range tbh


This or MediaPad M5 (or any other good alternative) ? My use is only YouTube, browsing, and gaming.

Tried cheap tablet such as TELCAST t10 before. Great screen, great battery life, poor performance especially when browsing and playing games. 


What the hell was wrong with “The New iPad”? It had the HD screen that replaced the previous low res screen and was just fine. 


I upgraded from my iPad Air 1 and bought the iPad 2017 back in February this year and to be quite honest, there is no competition when it comes to speed on the 2017 and 2018 iPad. If your trying to pick one, any will do. They are both identical apart from the Apple Pencil support and new A10 fusion processor on the new iPad, which doesn’t really make a difference. 

So I’m happy with my iPad 2017. :)


Does anyone have one specifically for a young child and their education?  My kids 4 and I feel like she’s on the cusp of getting value out of this thing.  Anyone have any pros or cons?  


wish i could replace my mac with an ipad. 

would love to plug it into a big display, do software development on it, unplug and take it to meetings where i can airplay and whiteboard using an apple pencil 

ugh why isn’t this real :(


I had an iPad  for about a week. No Apple care. It was 16 gig so I couldn’t install anything. Fell off my bed onto carpet and shattered. What a waste of $500 that was.


This review is poorly conceived. How could the reviewer write this review and not mention or compare it to the Chromebook even once. Does he not understand the purpose of this iPad? 


Did *The Verge* ever said something against the Apple? 


I can't believe they still put a camera on the back. Put that shit on the front.


A tablet shouldn't even cost $500 to begin with.  I think the iPad price points are perfect since the majority of users are using it for media consumption.  $329 is only $50 more than the 10.1 inch Samsung Tab A which is one of the better Android tablets out right now.  


Still no rose gold option for the 12.9". 


Thank the gods I have no use for a pad.  My wallet is safe.


$500 is still too much for many families to spend on a tablet regardless how great the reviews are.  Come back when Apple can compete against the $100 tablets.


If you don’t need the pencil support and if you only use your Air 2 for browsing and light stuff you won’t really notice a difference. 

Some people say their Air 2 is slow but I never had any issues at all with mine. The new iPad doesn’t seem faster (even though it technically is)


The low-end iPad hasn’t received any game-changing upgrades, but the Pro is pretty nice.


The screen on your iPad Air 2 is better than the 2018 iPad. That is why it is so cheap. 


Unless you’re gonna buy and really use the Pencil, this new iPad is not worth upgrading to from an Air 2. What you should be considering is the iPad Pro 10.5”. Yes, it’s pricey, but it’s got big upgrades that you’ll really notice.

It’s got a larger display in essentially the same size body, and that display is packed with wide color and ProMotion, both of which are significant enhancements. Performance-wise, it’s more than twice as fast with double the RAM. And on top of all that, you get faster Touch ID, big upgrades to the cameras, and much louder speakers.

The iPad Pro is what you want.


I have an Air 2 and love it as well.  Only reason I am considering upgrading is because my current is only a 16GB model.


The new iPad that's the subject of this review is much faster than the Air 2, but actually has worse design. It's thicker and heavier and has a worse screen.


I had an iPad Air 2 and upgraded last year with the launch of the 10.5” iPad Pro as it felt like an actual upgrade to me (unlike the 9.7” iPad Pro). My girlfriend is now in possession of my iPad Air 2 and it still runs solid despite being three-and-a-half years old. 

If you haven’t upgraded yet, I’d wait to see what the next generation iPad Pros bring to the table especially with WWDC on the horizon.


I had an Air 2 and had no reason to really upgrade because it still worked great. However, I was able to get a faster and newer 18 iPad for $160 because I sold the air 2 for $160. I can probably get another four to five years out of this one now. 


I had an Air 2 for years and while it certainly held its own it’s no contest when it comes to the 10.5 Pro I replaced it with. I don’t even have the Pencil and I still find it a more than worthy upgrade.

I’m with you, though. I held out for a long time but I have no regrets the Pro iPads are really really good. 


I jumped from the Air2 to the 10.5 Pro.  
The 120hz refresh alone makes this thing worth it.  
It is was a great upgrade.  


Speed, for one.  I also have an iPad Air 2, and it barely functions compared with my iPad Pro that I bought recently for photo editing on the go.  The difference is night and day.  I can barely stand using my Air anymore because it feels so sluggish in comparison.  No idea though how this new iPad will compare to the last generation Pro, but it should still be a significant and noticeable increase.


I would say save your money until it's no longer usable but if you really want to upgrade I would not consider this. I went from an air 2 to 9.7 inch iPad pro and love it. Better speakers, much nicer screen and looks so much smoother with the pro motion display. The apple pencil really cool too but I returned it after hearing so many issues with it not working after a year or so from reviews on Apple's site. You are probably best off waiting until Octoberish and see what Apple has in store for the next iPad rumored to be announced.


The Air 2 came out in 2014 and it still runs damn good, even with iOS 11 bogging it down slightly. Might be one of the most well made Apple products of all time. 


"The New iPad" was my first iPad. I bought it in April 2012. It was around then that leaks of the new iPhone were popping up showing the new connector that would be lightning. I was kind of annoyed that they would release a brand-new iPad just months before changing to a new connection system... Then the iPhone 5 event happened in September and they announced the iPad 4. Grr.

I think 7 months between devices might be the shortest time between major Apple product updates. The 4 got the lightning connector, a big processor improvement, a much better front camera, etc.

It stung because I always buy Apple products as soon as they are available to get the most time with them before they're updated. First world problem, I know, but the iPad 3 was definitely a stop-gap dud.


Still sour about buying that iPad 3 five or six weeks before the iPad 4 release.  I'm a much more informed customer now and won't be making similar mistakes again.. but I remember calling Apple, being denied any sort of return, and feeling screwed.  Can't shake it.


It may be the worst iPad but it was still the first retina iPad. Mine lives on a stand in the kitchen now and gets used for recipes all the time. Still going strong after 6 years.


The air wasn’t an objectively “bad” iPad, but I feel like it wasn’t one of the better implementations. The air 2 was insanely good though. 


I still have one of the "bad" iPads. My kids use it for some educational games, and a little bit of Netflix streaming. It's amazing how well that thing has held up through the abuse of two kids over seven years. The battery life is still pretty good too.

It's slow as hell at points, but reliable. I bought some cheap-o Amazon tablets thinking newer would be better, but they're just about as slow and crash often enough that the kids prefer the iPad.


Not sure of order of release but I remember the iPad Air (1st gen) being pretty bad.

The software lagged out of the box and it was clear that whatever version iOS it shipped with wasn't optimised well enough or the processor wasn't ready for it.

They fixed it next gen though.


iPad mini first generation is a terrible iPad, thing is so slow. 


The Air 1 was pretty bad, the 1GB of RAM made it run like ass 

Source: I have one 


The iPad 3 was the first retina screen iPad. It was a huge leap visually above the iPad 2.  Yeah, it got replaced by the 4 quickly, but it lasted me for many years. 


My parents still kept the iPad 3 for like 5 years no issues 


And yet, they are so utterly limited as to be mostly worthless once you are off the toilet.

I upgraded today from the mini 1 , boy this machine is stupidly fast compared to my old iPad.


What advantages exactly? I'm on the fence about buying the Pro vs. the regular but I don't think I need such a big processing power, I plan on using the iPad mostly for media consumption and the occasional game 


[deleted]


The best iPad for consumers from my humble opinion. 



The one problem I have with this iPad is the lack of an anti-reflective coating on it, which the Pro has (on top of the better colors and 120hz display). This annoys me particularly since I’d love to use the iPad outside without turning the brightness up to max 


Can I complain that there's not a mini version?  Or is that verboten too.


My only complain is that is not all screen like the iPhone X. I’m sure that’ll come later, but still, having an all screen iPad will definitely change the game. 


The air gap is horrendous 


My only complaint is that this new iPad maxes out at 128GB.

Part of the reason I personally don't like Android tablets has to do with software. Not only do Android tablets lack software support, but Android apps themselves suck on big screens. Oftentimes they're just blown up versions of the phone app. Awful waste of screen real estate.


Android has some fantastic phones, but their tablets have always sucked.


I'm actually planning to transition to Apple again. I was a Apple user back in the G4 days. I was a Windows Phone lover for a long time but went to Android as that started to die. What I loved about Windows Phone was the unified OS design and apps matching plus regular updates. I want that again. Android inconsistent updates and designs are driving me crazy. Plus one day my phone is fast and the other it slugs.

I wasn't a huge fan of iOS or OSX but I feel like they have matured to the point I would like them now. I also wanted a good tablet for work. Android tablets suck and as much as I love Surfaces, I just don't need another full OS computer. I'll keep my Thinkpad for work on Windows. I plan to get the new iPad, 2015 MacBook Pro and probably just a iPhone SE for now.

I can't believe I'm going back to Apple. I'm just tired of Android so much.


I know what you mean. As much as I want to use Android, and I have before, I always keep coming back to Apple due to how solid everything is (despite some limitations here and there)


[deleted]


I bought the newest ipad last year and returned it and got a used Galaxy s2 tab, the screen was so much worse on the iPad and since I use my tablet 95% for reading comic books the OLED was way nicer. I also could not stand how you couldn't customize the home screen, it was so annoying to use. I absolutely love the s2 over that iPad, I was really surprised at how bad it was.


I don’t think it’s necessarily less functionality so much as *different functionality. *

I adapted and overcame my Android workflow on iOS for most things. 


I didn't know Android was a company that made tablets.


Personally I'd go with the 2018.  The quad-core A10 seems like a big improvement over the A9 and will help it last longer.

https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/31/video-apples-2018-ipad-vs-2017-ipad-benchmark-comparison


IMO the extra 80 dollars is worth it just for the better CPU. It'll just last that much longer, get that many more updates.


If you are gaming then yes otherwise no. The improved gpu will make a big difference. The a9 in the 2017 is the minimum for games like fortnite 


Sure I’ll sell you my 2017 so I can buy the new one and use the pencil. 


I had the same question but about the 128GB version. I think the 32 wouldn't be enough for me - and they have a 128GB version of the iPad from last year for $309 refurbished. Would it be worth the extra $100 for the new iPad? I plan to use the iPad for mostly gaming (Clash, PUBG, World of Warships) and media content.


The 2018 will get an extra year of software support


One thing I noticed about the 2017 is that the TouchID is considerably slower than the 9.7" iPad Pro or my iPhone 7 Plus. So they're obviously using a slower TouchID sensor.

So there is at least ONE noticeable difference beyond pencil support.


iPad Pro all day...


A new Mini or, the gods, a Mini Pro would be a day 1 for me


I just want an iPhone version of a Galaxy Note...which I know is way too much to ask! 


The mini may get dropped before updated. Especially with Apple's increased focus on larger phones.


Don’t get a mini. It really struggles with iOS 11 and I don’t see that getting any better. 


Got a 128/2017 from Costco today for $369, think they're on sale in advance of the new ones.


https://twitter.com/backlon/status/949312644313374720?s=21


just over 8 years


It's always been $499 or less, right?

Now it's the best tablet under $330...


me thinks you rich


What’s the purpose of the laminated coating? Why is it better? Just for pen/finger friction?


Wouldn't that theoretically mean that replacing the glass, but not the entire display would be possible again?


They pretty much abandoned that market.


That's what I had until last year. Traded it in at Best Buy for the base model 2017 iPad. I think you can still get $125 for your iPad Air at Best Buy, it's well worth it to trade up. You can even use your existing cover.


Have you upgraded to 11.3 yet? Made a big difference to the performance of my original Air


[deleted]


Depends on what you are planning to use it for.


That fact that the iPad may last 7 to 10 years I'd say go for 128 GB.


Depends if you will be using it somewhere without internet access for large portions of time. Or if you want to do video editing on it.


Nilay praised HomePod heavily considering Siri and I think Dieter here really heavily praised the iPad, considering he said it's basically the only tablet under $500 worth buying and he's thankful Apple made it so good. Not sure what you expect him to say.


Faster processor 


No it’s the same shell as iPad Air 1.


your iPad 3 would have the same air gap (non-laminated screen).  It wasn't until the Air 2 and the Pros that iPads received laminated screens. 


[deleted]


For those use cases, not much, unless the more reflective screen of the regular iPad bothers you. You can find the 64GB iPad Pro 10.5" for $499 at some places, that would be the only one I'd consider if I was in the market for a 128GB 2018 iPad.


Currently $369 (got one today): https://www.costco.com/Apple-iPad-A9-Chip-128GB%2c-Silver.product.100350967.html


No, you buy that separately just like the pencil.  


Man, that's some tough carpet you have.


honestly do people even cross shop chromebooks and iPads?


He mention is not only meant for education, if you compare them by their education market value, this iPad still way behind since all the new features are not meant for consumers. Meaning either you get this ipad from your school, or you're not using any of those features...

This at the very end, is the new iPad 2018, he is reviewing it like that


A million things on the new Mac book pro? Issues with apples inability to make software. A company that has struggled to do cloud services? Siri? I cloud? 

I’m a huge Apple fan but everyone bashes the verge for being Apple fanboys but they bash them constantly. 


That doesn’t make sense. I use my rear camera to scan documents all the time. 


I think Android is far more focused on making a perfect Android phone experience.  The tablet experience is not bad, but not as optimized as the tablet experience on the iPad.  Everyone is more comfortable in their own ecosystem though, so I'm sure many Android users will disagree.


but i own a rose gold 12.9" ipad


$100 tablets are garbage.  You'd be better off buying a used older iPad than a new $100 tablet.


I don’t think I’d use the pencil for anything constructive, so I’m probably not the target audience for that. I’m in the same boat in terms of Air 2 speeds. I’ll probably just hold off for now. 


The 2gb ram on the 9.7 and air 2 do hold it back the most. Was sad cause I had both.

the pro is amazing, as someone who spent a lot of time working in DAWs and also editing video, somehow the ipad pro 12.9 in was more intuitive for making beats in a digital audio workstation, i was just cutting small videos but it all just worked great. I imagine a keyboard and a pencil, it becomes way powerful eh 


Is it better looking or just thiner?


[removed]


Not just louder, but better spaced speakers. I upgraded from and Air 2 to the 10.5” Pro and the speakers and bigger screen were my two biggest reasons. Makes it that much better to watch videos. 


> Yes, it’s pricey

> The iPad Pro is what you want.

Apple business strategy in splitting the iPad line proves to be successful.


I don't notice the wide colour day to day


The mini4 was my fav form :( I am hoping for some sort of mini. I refuse to believe it is dead. Apple has recently put a whole lot of ipads on their refurb site. iPar Air 2's mainly. Everything however. 12.9, 9.7, 10.5 ipad pros, ipad mini 4's, ipad 2017, some watch 3's recently... 

I just want a 7.9 in 


From a cost-benefit standpoint, most customers probably won't notice these differences so it makes sense for Apple to make a "bare-bones" iPad. Keeping the cost low with older technology allows them to compete in the education market. Apple's dominance in the tablet market is secured by the affordability of the iPad which makes it very difficult for competitors to try and capture their market share. 


I haven’t really had any issues with speed on my Air 2, for whatever reason (even with iOS 11’s issues). I’ll have to check out the Pro models next time I’m in the store. 


How are you editing photos on the go? Lightroom CC and use SD card adaptor for iPad? I've been toying with that idea and wondering how it's working for people who do it?


Barely functions? That doesn't sound good. Especially considering how smoothly it ran on iOS 8, 9 and 10. I really do believe that iOS 11 has been a complete shit show in terms of performance and that Apple really needs to pull it together for iOS 12.


Have you tried wiping it? Even after multiple betas, my Air 2 is snappy, definitely not barely functioning (like say my ipad3)


Agree 100%. My Air 2 works like new and it’s battery always lasts me 15 hours+ of use. No joke. Love the thing!


Even my Air 1 keeps trucking. It stutters a bit with typing occasionally, but the battery still lasts forever, especially considering it is now a pretty old device.


I have an Air 2 and iPad Pro 10.5, even though my Air2 works great still for my job, the pro absolutely kills it in performance, screen and audio. 


I got a lemon Air 2, it died 2 months after warranty expired.  One day it started to overheat and drain faster than it would charge and overnight it just wouldn't boot anymore.  I did the usual steps of doing a trickle charge overnight using an iPhone charger, doing the buttom combinations, etc.  I'm assuming the battery had some major issue and is the dead component, but they sealed it up quite good it's not worth possibly breaking it to try to repair it.  Apple tried to charge me $250 to fix it, but at that price, it's no where worth while, so now I have a dead one sitting in a drawer.

The rest of the iPads in my family including an iPad mini 2, 2x mini 4s and Air (1st gen) are still working quite well though.  Just disappointed in that lone Air 2.


My Air 2 runs fine with 11.3 and I love it. I’m kinda stuck with it too as Steve Wozniak signed it for me. Not sure what I’m going to do when I’m forced to upgrade. 


 Still use my mini 2 on a daily basis. It’s a little sluggish, but works fine for web browsing, messaging, Reddit, and video streaming. 


The original Air on 11.2 was jerky, but 11.3 has worked some black magic as it feels snappy again.


Have you refreshed it/installed iOS 11 clean? Mine runs it flawlessly, like new basically 


I completely disagree. Battery life is fine but holy shit it’s almost unusable on ios 11. 


My iPad 4 is still alive and kicking. It's running on iOS 10.3.3 and still no signs of slowing down. 


I bought the 3 also. At the time the Retina display was enough to buy but it did hurt to have the new 4 released so shortly after, considering I'd spent $700 on the 64GB model.


My first iPad was the iPad 3 as well. And believe it or not, I still have it lol and runs OK for streaming media on it as the display still holds it's position well against many competitors. I still remember when they put a Retina display on a display that big and I was blown away by the quality back then.


Yeah they pretty obviously made some severe compromises to get retina on there, easily the hottest, slowest iPad. The air was a revelation for me. 


Which "The New iPad"...? There were several.


Don't be too hard on yourself. I don't think anyone was expecting the iPad 4 to come out as soon as it did.


Sucks. I remember people being able to exchange theirs if their purchase was within 30 days. 


Just remember if it's any consolation there are people in this world without food and water. Yes the 3 was a bit of a dud but you should move on and make the best of what you have.


What makes it the worst? Still my only iPad, however updates broke it so it slowed to a crawl and is unusable. 


The first Air made it about as light as an iPad Mini, but not much more improved. The Air 2 fixed the Air's issues and made it even lighter. 

(Basically the Air S if they used iPhone naming).


For Netflix streaming for my son, he has my old 16GB iPad 2 (yes, the second gen version, *not* the *Air* 2). Yes it’s slow to respond and it stuck on the last version of iOS 10 (I think? Could be 9?) but its battery still kicks out over ten hours of usage and a couple of days of standby. It’s a solid device and no mistake.


Get 128 GB and it'll do you for the next 8 years.


* Larger, laminated screen with wide colour gamut and ProMotion.

* 12mp camera with f/1.8 lens (vs. 8mp + f/2.4)

* Smart connector for better keyboard compatibility

* Faster processor

I'm a photographer and videographer and I use the heck out of my iPad Pro, so the advantages are worth it to me. I also notice a huge difference between the screens. My gf does not.


The 10.5 inch iPro has some advantage there: much better screen: laminated, anti-glare, HDR support for Netflix. Speakers setup is also superior: quad vs duo speaker.




Also this sub “The MBA replacement must have identical specs to MBP 13” but be priced $500 lower.”


After this iPad announcement that might actually be a reality soon. An iPad with pencil support for £300? This is a great step forward. 


So keep an eye on the Apple refurbished section.


Imo I think they need to step it up with the Pros, this new one is gonna be an absolute beast and have pencil support. Why would I ever spend the premium on a Pro? Smart connector doesn’t do enough yet to justify the price difference. 


I mean you can find 9.7" pro models on eBay for around $300 sooooooo......


If you care about these things, you aren’t the target, and should probably get a Pro.

They are much more expensive, but they are not overpriced at all.


You're not alone in that. I was really hoping there would be a new iPad mini with the features everyone just seems to take for granted these days.


That'll be the Pro 


I’m not so sure I would like that. I enjoy the bezel on the iPad because I can hold onto it without touching the screen. On my X, that’s not an issue because it can sit in my hand. Can’t do that with a 9” iPad. 


An iPhone with that screen costs $1,000. There's no way they're making a cheap iPad with that screen.


You need bezels when drawing.  Artists don’t draw to the edge of the paper.

Maximizing every MM of screen makes sense on a phone, not on a big screen.


Why would you ever want that? How are you supposed to hold it?


I think they wanted some bezel for productivity purposes.

Honestly, "all-screen" is form over function. It leads to some disaster design like notches.


Which is more than anyone who's not buying the Pro will ever need.


better speakers and a spec bump. If you want more than that, you need a pro


Honestly this is kind of a pro in my book for Android. Sure, some apps aren't optimized for a large screen, but at least they still display using the full screen at normal resolution since Android Apps are designed to scale across many different display resolutions and aspect ratios.

If I'm on my Air 2 and I'm using any number of apps that doesn't have tablet mode (there are many big ones like Instagram) it just fucking shows up as if I'm browsing on a goddamn iPhone 4. Why the fuck. Why not at least do iPhone 8+ for fuck's sake. And then when you blow it up it's actually literally zooming, so things become blurry AND it for some reason needs to have FOUR sides of black bars? Wtf this is probably the dumbest way of implementing this at all


I mean ipad apps aren't really that much better than the "blown up phone apps" . All a lot of app devs do is just make the side bar show up 24/7 instead of whenever you swipe from the side. 


There where some great budget tablets (nexus 7s) but nobody wants to make a new tablet with decent specs, but not bloat it to shit with a bunch of useless software.


Idk, I've had a Samsung Tab S2 for the past few years with no complaints. Still works great with pretty heavy usage 


It's a matter of consistency at this point. With Apple, you know exactly what you get. With Android, they flip the script and can't unify or be consistent with apps or formats or versions. It's too fragmented and faulty.


Problem is trying to find 'high end' android tablets.  They don't really exist anymore.  Always mid to low end processors and minimal ram.  Android is allowing for Apple to take the higher market while they settle for lower end.  I assume that is because they view Chromebooks as the answer to the iPads, but that is a different system completely. 


It's the same thing as people who go from a cheap or even a midgrade Windows laptop to a MacBook pro. Then they go "omg windoze laptop suxx compared to my $1600 MacBook pro".


Wa my $150 Android doesn't preform the same as my 1000 iPhone , all Android's must suck /s


Isn’t the S2’s battery life terrible? I remember the battery was tiny since they made the s2 super thin and light. I know they made the s3 thicker with a bigger battery because of the complaints


I’m actually starting to rethink that maybe I do want the pencil. Might be nice for work, being able to take notes on it during meetings and such


It’s the same with the new one - they haven’t updated the Touch ID sensor.


Serious question, but why?


Admittedly, my upgrade to a + phone is another reason I don’t use the Mini as often.   
Still, it’s a great form factor for note taking. 


My mini is absolutely fine with iOS 11(.3). I’ve never had any hiccups at all with it.


I’m using my iPad mini 3 with 11.3 right now and it works just fine.

Well almost..
Another $99 for the pen....$429...sic

I use my iPad Pro for school every day, it’s actually amazing. Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil make note taking and doing assignments really efficient and productive. The multitasking on these devices is really good at this point. 


thanks for the suggestion


It does depend. I can get a used first gen pro for essentially the same price as the 2018 iPad. The only real benefit is the laminated screen, speakers, graphics, and smart connector. The processor of the 2018 is slightly better though and would come with warranty. 


No just a product made of glass. 


In education? They absolutely do. My old elementary school went from MacBooks, to iPads to chrome books most recently and they’re not the only board doing it.


I miss those. Every time i watch something they almost cum. 


I totally agree that iOS is a much better tablet experience. My experience in retail is that a ton of people are scared of the price point of the iPads even though they love Apple. My OG iPad mini is still great today which can't be said about Android tablets. And I normally bring that up to people when they look at an $80 Samsung Tab E lite haha


Strange that it’s not currently listed on Apple.com: https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/🤔🤔


$100 used iPads are slow as fuck


Yea it’s definitely not a big upgrade. The Pros are a different story though. They’re noticeably better. 

New Pros are rumored to be launching later this year with an iPhone X style redesign. I would honestly wait until then if the price range is within your budget. If not, the 2019 iPad will probably be a nice jump. 


I use a third party stylus on my air 2 after returning a pro and pencil and don’t find it lacking. With my anker Bluetooth keyboard I feel it is as good as the pro I still love it.

Edit: the 9.7 pro that is. I use the stylus in procreate and find the results good enough. I could not justify the extra cost of the pro for myself. 


Are you using splashtop to run a DAW from your PC or using a native iPad DAW? If so which one?


Mostly just thinner. The quality is the same but the iPad Air 2 display has a better anti-reflective coating than the 2018 iPad.

7.9" with pen support! Could work as an actual notepad.


> I refuse to believe it is dead.

Me too! The form factor is perfect for reading!



Most? Probably. But I know a lot of people with older iPads who look at it and get annoyed that the design isn’t an upgrade over what they already have. 


I think people just do not notice until they upgrade to a new device. One of my family members needed a new phone, I gave my old 5S and suggested the iphone SE for $150 at wal mart. 

"No, I like the iphone 5S thanks" 

k, bye -

I use Lightroom CC with the SD Adaptor between my iPad Air 2 and my iPhone 8 Plus and I love it.  Makes my workflow so much better than even a few years ago. Lightroom CC on mobile is slowly approaching the same functionality as the computer.  They just added some of that perspective adjustment stuff today too.


SD adapter (official one...a third party one I tried didn’t work) to import the photos into the Photos app.  From there I use either Pixelmator, Affinity, Lightroom CC, Photoshop CC, or the Photos app itself.  With the pencil I can make fine adjustments just like I would on an expensive Wacom touchscreen tablet.  Only reason I need to go into a computer to edit anymore is for the high effort photos that require compositing, and even then I could do that on the iPad with the software I listed above.


I'm using iOS 11 on an original iPad Air, and it's perfectly fine. No performance problems. 

I think sometimes people just exaggerate a bit. Hard to imagine, I know, but I suspect it happens. 


Mine still works pretty good but I’ll admit since I upgraded to 11 on it it’s been hiccuping and stuttering all over the place. I really wish I hadn’t updated.


I thought I had wiped it fairly recently, but I suppose I could try again.


Exactly! I still have mine and it just works. Thats what I love about it. I was itching to get a pro but when I looked at them, my Air was perfect


My Air 2 runs great too. I "only" get about 12 hours battery life though but I'm on 9.3.3. What OS are you using? Been wary to update it in case it does get slower


My Air still works pretty well, biggest issue is that it really suffers from tab reloading... But it always had that problem. It's just a little worse now.


Bleh getting phantom touches on two of mine...


Does yours heat up when in use around the motherboard area (right side of the display)? 
I probably need to restore mine as it runs quite hot pretty quickly.


Yeah my air 1 is the slowest Apple product in my house and it’s.... acceptable. Just don’t expect too much out of it. 


Same with my original Air


My Air 1 is meh. Apps don’t stay in memory for long at all, and animations are very stuttery. Improves a little with Reduce Motion on. But boy, you’re not kidding when you say the battery still lasts forever! On a side note, I wish the Air 1 supported split view apps.


What’s probably most amazing to me about the iPad product line is that the old iPads seem to hold performance/value over time far better than any other computer, and yet somehow each year the new iPad is substantially better than its predecessors. 

More than any other device, I’ll want to upgrade my excessively powerful iPad for a new model. 


That is really weird. My Air 2's battery puffed up and forced the screen off of the case while I was out of warranty. They said repairs could cost up to $250 if the damage was my fault but if the battery was defective then it would only be $99.  You should call them up, ask to speak with a supervisor and send it in. Worst that could happen is you refuse the full price charges and they recycle it.  The chumps at the retail apple store gave me that $250 charge spiel but the phone line support was much more helpful. I had a refurbished replacement two days after I sent my old one in. I've now got more use out of my replacement Air 2 than I did the first one.


Did you pay for it with a credit card? Many will extend the warranty.


Only Netflix for me. 


My iPad 3 is pretty useless now. So stupidly slow (clean install of iOS does nothing to help). Apps crash very frequently and it likes to restart itself randomly (even when doing things like just sitting there displaying a recipe in Safari). A new battery may help this but it's not really worth it in a device that's so old.


I bought a used iPad 2 to run Shopkeep in my business.  It did that for a few years, and recently I gave it to my elderly in-laws for Skype, email and web browsing - works just fine still.  It's not quick, but it just works.



Our family one is on 9.3.5 still and running fine. We mainly only use it on longer family trips for the kids to watch shows on so they don’t drive us insane. I don’t see a reason to bump it up to 10.3.3. It will probably just slow it down another notch. Plus I like being able to use the battery life app to see the battery info like charge cycles and capacity. Apple starting hiding that stuff in iOS 10. Remember how fast it was on iOS 6?!?! Man I wish I would have never updated it. Then again not many apps that we use would be working right now. Long live the iPad 4! 


Don't update to IOS11. This killed my 4. Thing is slow as shit now even with a fresh install.


ouch


Same here. It’s annoying to still have to rely on a ten pin charger, but it runs Netflix reliably for my kids.

It was underpowered out of the box to power the retina display. 


It was heavier than the iPad it replaced, which is pretty unheard of in Apple product lines. It could just barely drive that big display so the UI lagged frequently even when it was new. Not only was it replaced by something faster in 7 months but its replacement also brought in a Lightning connector to replace the 30-pin dock connector making the old one even more antiquated than a new model usually would. Some of its faults are due to circumstance more than the product itself.

I don’t regret owning it for a second. It was my first iPad because I was holding out for retina and it was spectacular even though it weighed a lot and dropped frames.


I was really annoyed by this, so much that I just haven't used mine since updating to iOS 8(IIRC). It's getting traded in for a new iPad.

My mum stayed on iOS 7 and that is still slow, but not as bad as iOS 8. The problem is that lots of apps don't support iOS 7 any more. Hers is getting the same trade in treatment.


You do photography and video professionally on an iPad? Could I see some examples?


>Faster processor

I thought both the iPad Pro and regular iPad had an A10 chip now. 


If only the MBA didn't have 3-year old specs sold at 2018 prices.


Used is not the same as new.


I'd buy a mini with pencil support in a second. That's the sweet spot for note taking, I think.


Probably. I currently have the pro and I kinda hate it since I switched to the X because of the full screen lol


If they do a no-bezel or slim-bezel iPad, I wouldn't be surprised if they also implement a smart input rejection system around the edges.


I imagine a slim bezel iPad would pretty much just be the 10.5's side bezels all the way around, *maybe* a little bit narrower. I doubt they'd do bezels as narrow as the X.


I can’t believe this is so upvoted, Apple has the best accidental input rejection on the market. *Of course* a more edge-to-edge screen would be better on the iPad. 


It's more difficult and more expensive to make tech smaller so the iPad should be cheaper. It also won't have stainless steel construction and, I hope, no glass back (just makes me nervous on a tablet).


The new X range should be cheaper next time, I think it was expensive because of the materials and an excessive amount of R&D. 


iPhone screen cost so much because it’s and fold OLED. But this year iPad Pro will have LCD so it’s much cheaper. 


~~8GB~~ ~~16GB~~ 32GB is enough for anyone.

I've heard this argument before from Apple apologists.


Exactly and that’s pretty disappointing for a yearly update. 


I remember reading once the idea is to shame devs into making a real iPad app. If their iPhone 8+ app worked good enough, it would be less incentive to take that second step


Instagram is probably the only exception among common apps, and that's entirely on them. So many other apps do support the iPad with a proper layout.


[deleted]


The pixel c was the last one, true. Samsung still comes out with some but nothing top of the line. I would say that is high end enough for most people. 


Exactly. It doesn’t help people just buy whatever junk their carrier pushes.


Even a lot of high end windows laptops have issues. The xps 13/15 had a terrible WiFi card, its screen had a very low refresh rate and its single thunderbolt 3 port was gimped to 2 PCIe lanes instead of the full 4. The yoga 720 throttles like crazy under load and has pretty bad build quality. The x1 carbon’s build quality was pretty bad too and it’s ridiculously expensive for the specs although it’s the only laptop I know of with a matte touchscreen. And these are just a few of the examples


I've has no issues with battery, one charge lasts me several days easily. Granted all I really do is read comics and Reddit and sometimes Netflix.


Hehe. Yeah man I got a laptop from work that has a pen with it and I was thinking to myself I’d never use it. Well you can double click the button on the end of the pen and draw on the screen like a football announcer. It’s amazing for presentations. If a customer has a question I can double tap that pen and start drawing and pointing to make it easier to follow along. 

I don’t know what the Apple Pencil can do but I have to imagine Apple implemented it better than HP  


Everyone’s use case and reasons might differ, but for me it’s the promotion screen (120hz refresh rate). It’s so hard to go back to anything lower once you get use to that.


It has 4 GB RAM instead of 2, this alone might worth $70 but it has a Smart Connector, better screen, camera, processor and more speakers as well.


If nothing else than the screen. The 120hz refresh and HDR is worth every penny.


I've heard this before that it's a great note taking form factor, but therein lies an issue. The larger iPad is better for practically all tasks. Being great for one or two tasks may not be enough in Apple's eyes. They should update it this year or next or just get on with it and drop it from the lineup.


No sweat. The Verge always has the best wallpaper on their product demos. This is not the first time I’ve been on the hunt. 😉


The pen is optional. 

Also, it's not all I hoped.  Actually, it's not even close to anything I hoped.




Did the Air 2 have that? Because I thought the air 2 was the best iPad i've used 


for education, chromebooks are a no-brainer but I think the purpose of this article was what's best for personal use. 


If I wanted a tablet (personal use), I would not consider a chrome book.  So I guess, perspective is everything?


Ya, unlike those blazing fast $100 android tablets. 


Which 3rd party stylus do you use on the Air 2?


[deleted]


Here is my list in order below, each one of these has nice functionality as well as UI. At least the Korg DAW has a specific iPad Pro port. I really suggest you try these out, the korg one especially. 

1) Korg Gadget for iOS
2) Auxy Studio for iPad
3) FL Studio For iPad
4) Akai iMPC for iPad


1) http://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_gadget/for_ios.php 

HIGHLY recommend. I would like someone to point out flaws in this because I just do not see too many. 

2) https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/auxy-studio/id1034348186?platform=ipad&preserveScrollPosition=true#platform/ipad

highly reccomend, the KORG one is more of a true DAW that could rival a desktop application. This Auxy Studio to me always felt like more of a drum machine. It is mostly just a sequencer that is super fun and can put together a lot of really good sounding things. I have not used it in about 2 years so it may have changed a lot and have a lot more functionality. This one you will notice it has a pretty nice UI. The only drawback is I wish I could customize the colors of my piano roll. 


3) https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619?platform=ipad&preserveScrollPosition=true#platform/ipad

Have you ever heard of FL Studio? 

Well, it is now ported to the iPad! 

4) http://www.akaipro.com/products/drum-machines-and-synths/impc

Many a hit track has been made on a shitty windows computer and FL Studio. Believe it or not this DAW is and has been pretty powerful. 

Have you ever heard of the Akai MPC? 

Also, have ported over to iPad. 




I was thinking about upgrading to the new ipad from my air 2 mostly for the cpu.  My air 2 is not too slow, but I can get a good chunk of money for it now, and I figure in the future I won't be able to.  


It is also laminated so the display is closer to the glass (which also helps with the anti-glare).  It results in better contrast as well even though the display technology is the same on both.


Thanks. Follow up question:  How would one even know that difference?  The info given by Apple on their own product pages makes the screens out to be identical, mainly due to so little information being given.  


Thats the point. The competitor of the iPad is actually the iPad Pro, and they have to make the iPad ugly enough for non-technical people to consider the Pro, but not so ugly that people laugh at Apple as a company.

Thats what the article says when it says Apple is just doing the bare minimum


> the iphone SE for $150 at wal mart. 

If I ever moved to the US, this is gotta be one of the reason.


looks interesting! you have any examples of photos you've edited with this?


Sounds very efficient and convenient!  Thanks for the help.


Oh man, I have a totally different experience with my Air and ios 11.  It’s significantly slower for everything, apps reload when I switch between them that didn’t in iOS 10.

I’m honestly thinking about upgrading because the performance is such a bummer.


Air 2 here, iOS 11 is totally fine.  Speed is good.  Crashes never.


Especially when the Air is usually on sale on Black Friday for $300 or less...


9.3.3 has a good number of unpatched security flaws. You should upgrade. 


I’m on iOS 11.3. Id highly recommend. I use battery saver when it’s below 20%. It also sits idle for 10 days and gets about 15 hours use each charge.


You should REALLY try out iOS 11 now. I mean, it still has its bugs but after 11.3 I think it’s worth the trade for the features you get. I don’t know if I’d recommend iOS 11 for iPhone, but for iPad I think it’s a must have. It really changed the game for iPad 


Never, but I guess I have a case on but it’s pretty thin so I think I’d be able to tell. 


It would be absolutely perfect if it had more than the base 16GB. But that’s on me. From now on I only buy the higher tiers. I could totally see myself using the 128GB Air for another 2+ years.


Have you updated to 11.3 yet? It has improved the performance on my Air 1 significantly!


That comes with the ecosystem. Being able to design software for only 10-20 devices rather than 650000  devices like Windows has to. 


I did, I spoke to a supervisor over the phone and they advise I should take it to the local Apple store.  They saw there was literally no physical damage whatsoever (it was simply used as a night stand tablet that went as far as the couch in the living room), but since the battery wasn't puffed up they didn't offer me anything at all.  They simply said that it would cost $250 and there would be nothing they could do about it.  They wouldn't even let me take the gamble of just getting the battery replaced to see if that would fix the issue.

Honestly, I should have gotten my gf to wear a push up bra and a low cut shirt - it would have probably gotten the issue resolved for free since many times these things are at the discretion of the workers.


The iPad 3 might actually be the most gimped iOS product of all time, the processor was not ready to support the retina display on the larger iPad screen (hence the 4 coming out 6-8 months later). My mom still uses it, because her uses are super light, but if you want to do more than watch a video or write a note it's bad.

I 100% would not put any money into the iPad 3. If you are in the US, the new iPad is really good value for how much longevity it will have (which is way more than the iPad 3)  


Yep. I sold my iPad 3 a while back. After updating to ~~iOS10~~ iOS8 to get Apple Music it ran like shit. That was really disappointing.


This was my iPad mini 2. I traded it in along with an old iPhone 5, iPhone 6 and an iPhone 6 Plus and bought the 32GB iPad 6 and Apple Care for $50. This thing is awesome. 


I guess 10.3.3 is the last update released for iPad 4.


That doesn’t happen to all of them? Oh. 


shouldn't have existed


I do most of my actual editing on my iMac, but lately I've been doing some photo work on the go.

Gently used really isn’t that big of a deal. I’ve gotten a Surface Book for almost half of MSRP in phenomenal condition. 


Apple Refurbished is 99% the same as new.


Yeah it’s about $440 for a new 2016 iPad Pro. They should have just dropped the price of that one to $330, changed the name and added a new color and that should have been the new budget iPad instead of this half baked “new” one.


This year's pro will be my first ipad since the 3rd Gen, I'm excited 


They already do that


The OLED on the iPhone X and the phone itself is just inflated in price.  Apple just wanted to dip its toes into a new pricing range and it proved relatively successful.  Samsung is able to offer a similar higher resolution version of the screen on the S9 for about $300 less.  


[deleted]


It blows literally every other tablet less than $500 out of the water, and is $320.


Nice Apple, Instagram has been so shamed for the last 8 years. Meanwhile I and many others have suffered from a shit user experience.


Had the 2012... Had the nand problem... Was useless one year later. Never will buy another Asus... Will probably never buy another Google branded tablet... They make bad compromises to bring big features at low prices. My iPad mini 4 still perfect. iPad 2 still in use after 7 years.


I have the Nexus 7 2013 and there really is nothing with that form factor to replace it. Just give us another Nexus 7 but with newer internals.


I tried a Tab out about 7 months ago. I had it for a week. The screen started lagging, the button presses wouldn't register. I reset it. A few days later, same thing. Returned and didn't even bother to find out if it was an issue with mine specifically or just in general. 


I think they are playing the long con, saturating the market, grabbing market share. 


>Well you can double click the button on the end of the pen and draw on the screen like a football announcer.

Haha I can just imagine you putting a game on online, pausing it and drawing on the screen pretending you're in the studio hah


If I'm never going to use a keyboard with my ipad is there any purpose for the smart connector?  can you charge the tablet with it?


[deleted]


They're faster. I've owned both and I'm not some fan boy.


Ok thanks 


Very nice, thank you.


How much do you think you would get for a used iPad Air 2 right now ?


[deleted]


I have the same experience. I actually dislike using my iPad now because everything is so slow and laggy. 


Can confirm


Jumping on the love train here.  Work gave me an Air 2 a few years ago and it's working wonderfully still - 11.3 loaded, outstanding performance, battery time is still fantastic.  Handles the playtime abuse from my kids on the weekend, operates flawlessly at work throughout the week.  My only hope is that management allows me to keep it permanently once the extended warranty expires (or buy it off them at a seriously reduced rate).  It's a keeper.


They probably jailbreak.


Battery saver on an iPad?! 


Ah right, I use mine daily for safari so wonder if the same would apply. 


That is rough man. I'm 200+ miles away from an apple store and took mine to a local retail authorized center. They gave me that exact same answer and I called support back again and finally got help. Probably not worth your time or money. Sorry you had such a bad experience. 


Employees have no say anymore, it’s all systematic.  

If iPad powers on but can’t hold charge, battery cost, or if the battery swells, battery cost. 

If the iPad cannot power on when attached to power, something else other than the battery is not working. The system flat will not let you replace an iPad at the lower battery cost unless the iPad can power on and the battery is consumed/failed in diagnostics. 


You can’t even watch a video on YouTube because it’s so laggy.


iPad 3rd gen didn't get iOS 10...


Hmm, it seems you're right. Guess it's slow as shit for no reason then.


I mean yeah eventually, but it was the odd duck of the iPad lineup for how short the lifespan was a leap between. 


Nice work on those shots. Really well done.


This is probably a silly question, but how do you get the photos to look so bright? I feel like whenever I edit photos they become either blown out or way too much contrast.


Excellent work! Thanks for providing examples. Would you mind describing your workflow on the iPad? I'm intrigued by this.


Holy shit man, this is awesome. Never could've known those were taken on a freaking iPad (postprocessing notwithstanding).


But they can't drop the price to $330. It's $440.

Also this new iPad has *better performance* than that 2016 Pro. The A9X is just too expensive, as is the laminated screen.


I got an iPad Pro 12.9 in when it first came out and it was the most amazing thing ever, I think you are really going to enjoy it! Even watching youtube was amazing but I was making beats on it, which was incredibly intuitive. almost better than hardware, in fact, it was better than programming a hardware drum machine because of the versatility.


And it doesn't work well at all. 


It’s not exactly super reliable though.



AFAIK Samsung's displays are also slightly better than what they sell to Apple, correct? 

I totally forgot the OLED screen in my previous comment - that would really drive up the cost of an iPad.


True, but then again the pros have never hit that price point. Maybe in a few years when the components aren’t as cutting edge. 


As far as screens go, Samsung uses AMOLED screens in their S line tablets (which, unfathomably, they haven't yet refreshed), so it's worth a look how much a high end AMOLED screen costs them in production, as an iPad screen would have a similar sourcing price.


[deleted]


Galaxy tab is really good for consuming content because Samsung screens are really good. Not the best surfing web tablet because of lag but their isnt a better tablet on the market for watching YouTube,Netflix, etc. besides maybe the iPad Pro because that like a mini tv. 


When someone can't say which tablet they used, I can't help but assume that they bought some random tablet from Amazon without knowing it was released before the Mini 2. My elderly parent's Tab A still runs smooth as hell (following a monthly check up to make sure they haven't installed more "free" apps), and it's nowhere near top of the line. 

IMO, the problem with Samsung tablets is just a sheer lack of app support for productivity work on Android. They feel like oversized phones (complete with overly skinned UI), which is great if you want a Netflix device. Unfortunately, most of us can't pay 400 for a device devoted solely to watching videos. 


Hey don’t judge me and my sports nerdiness. lol 

For real I am not a sports guy but in the world of networking, it’s amazing to be able to draw on top of existing diagrams while in a video conference. 


[deleted]


Yea, you can charge through it too (albeit slowly). There are a few docks out on the market that charge it that way...


You can. Not quickly, but I have a Logitech charger dock that I love.


So Air 2 was laminated but the new iPad is not?


Apple and Best Buy are giving $180 for working iPad Air 2s. You can probably get $225 or more if you sold on Craigslist or something. 


$200 or so.  Depending on size.  I have an ideal situation because I have the 128 and the 64 in the new ipad would be fine for me.  


No, my question is how do you even know the Air 2 screen is laminated vs the new one not being laminated?  I've never seen that information anywhere.

EDIT:  nevermind, I see it now on the page that lets you compare all the iPad models.  It does mention laminated display there. (I was looking on the individual product pages, not the comparison page)

I still have the Air 1, which I believe does *not* have a laminated display.


Thirded here - my Air was fine until iOS9, started to feel a little sluggish sometimes (but only sometimes) with iOS 10, and is a total dog in iOS 11. It’s functional but not even close to how responsive it used to be, it even lags slightly opening the dock and then the control centre 


The idea of an iPad that runs as smooth as my iPhone 7 is pretty appealing


Im all for jailbreak, my iPhone is jailbroken, but I dont see any reason why you would use an older iOS than iOS 11 on the iPad given how much changes it has.


Haha whoops got confused with my iPhone! But it’s surprising it lasts that long without battery saver.


As long as your not gaming or streaming tv shows the whole time, it should be roughly similar in use time. I can’t recommend iOS 11.3 enough actually it’s been amazing, contrary to all the hate iOS 11 gets. It’ll also tell you how good your battery still is.


Damn, iOS updates pass faster than I realize. Had to have been migrating from iOS7 to iOS8 to get Apple Music. I know I hadn’t used in a long time and just wanted to use it as a dedicated music player. Certainly older than I remember, lol.


My iPad 4 is so slow its unusable as well.


Thank you! 


Hmm, I'm not quite sure what you mean. In the people shots, many of them were lit with off-camera flash, so there is balance between the background and the subject. I wouldn't be able to expose for both without the flash.

Is there a specific shot you could reference?


Sure! And thanks! My workflow is evolving and it's not the same for every shoot, but here we go:

* First, I now shoot with Fuji cameras (X-H1 and X-T2). I have dialled in the film simulation and picture settings I really like, so that means I actually don't have to do too much editing for a lot of stuff. I shoot RAW+JPEG but usually only import the JPEGs onto the iPad. The JPEGs on the Fuji cameras are insanely good. They have a lot of information and are fairly large files, so I only need to grab RAWs for extreme fixes.

* The Fuji cameras have WiFi, but I usually just use the SD card and the SD to Lightning adapter for my iPad. I import into the stock Photos app.

* For some small/easy shoots, I can actually do most of what I need to do with the stock Photos app. Basic exposure/saturation, etc. is all I need to do sometimes.

* For more intense editing, I use Lightroom Mobile.

* If I need to do compositing (replacing heads/smiles, etc.), I use Affinity Photo.

* The last bit that I'm still back and forth about is archiving. Lightroom Mobile syncs my catalogue across devices, so if I get the final images into it on the iPad, then the photos will show up on my iMac. But the Photos app syncs as well, so basically I'm between those two apps and then deciding how I will archive on my iMac and to my external drives.

* Lastly, I usually still grab the RAWs and import them onto my iMac.


Noooooo. EDITED on an iPad! Haha. 

Shot with Fuji cameras. 


Put the A10 in the 2016 pro, drop the price, voila, best of both worlds. 

Also, way to cherry pick one difference between them. The 2016 Pro has better cameras, faster Touch ID, a better screen, stereo speakers and quite a few other things that are better than the new budget model.


Are there any good DAW/interfaces that can work with iPad?  I’ve been out of the game but I can never write my ideas down anywhere except with voice notes and while it works, having tracks would be even better. 

Even just a 1/4” input would work, but XLR (or combo jack) would be better. 


Which drum app?


I have a 9.7 right now. Use it mostly while lounging in bed. Do you think the 12.9 will be comfortable for that? 


They're neck and neck with the OLEDs at this point.  The ones used by Galaxy phones have less peak overall brightness, but the Galaxy ones has highest brightness in isolated areas for short burst of time.  The Galaxy ones also have higher resolution than the iPhone ones.  

But the overall cost of the OLEDs is highly exaggerated.  Sure, they're more expensive to manufacture than an LCD, but not THAT much.  Samsung was able to put their top of the line OLEDs on their flagship tablets in the past too and priced them similarly to the iPad Pros.  The Note 10.1 and subsequent Note Pro line which included the S-Pen by default was similarly priced to the current iPad Pro 10.5 and 12.9 if you include the price of the pencil.  Apple could definitely still make a profit even if they used more expensive OLED displays.


Nope, there are a ton of other tablets released in the last year under $500. They just all suck except the iPad.


Haha no I love the nerdiness, fucking embrace that shit, haha.

Yeah I can imagine it's an excellent feature


You don't have to charge your keyboard since the smart connector powers the keyboard. There's no wait time for connection with the smart connector. 

I guess one could argue that there's less latency with the smart connector, but I doubt anyone could notice that difference. 


Because a Bluetooth keyboard has to be charged separately, take a few seconds to connect and will timeout to save battery, so you can never really start typing right away on it (which after using an Apple Smart Connector Keyboard for a while, feels archaic to go back to a Bluetooth one).


Just thinking about mounting an iPad slightly permanently so a slick charger would be nice, but not necessary.


[deleted]


Thought so. No worries :)


I've been so tempted to give it a go for a while but I just don't know anything that I really need in it. I'd have done it instantly if I could restore back to 9 but I'm not sure it's worth the risk when it's running so smoothly. 


Thanks so much for the detailed post. That's really cool how you have the film simulation adjustments made on the camera itself. I recently started shooting weddings and events so I appreciate hearing how other people do things as I figure out what will work best for me. I wish you and your business the best!


Haha, so we aren't quite living the future I was picturing in my head for the past hour.

I guess it's still pretty cool that you have Photoshop and Lightroom on iOS. Do you feel boxed in on the iOS versions?


Which is why it's $100 more expensive. All the things you just listed are why it can't be in a $330 product.


Yeah I do. Just remember that it’s going to be pretty damn big. 

MacBook Pro is maybe what 3 lbs? An iPad Pro might be 1.8 lbs. and it is all screen. I sold mine and got a MacBook Air bc the iPad Pro felt expensive. I like my devices naked as often as possible. So. I really just didn’t trust myself with it and I wanted a small laptop. I now regret all of that however. 


Yeah a bunch of china shovel ware. Microsoft and google have both given up on tablets. Microsoft haven’t updated their plain surface line and android manufacturers don’t even put any work into their tablets. They are just bare minimum efforts to check boxes. You can tell because they don’t even bother to make flagship tablets. 


Maybe, but it’s not so crazy to think that a $440 iPad could have been slightly tweaked and dropped to ~$350, especially since the A10 is cheaper than the A9X already and is an upgrade in performance.

Releasing this $330 iPad is not exciting to many people because it feels like an iPad from 2014. Having a slightly cheaper version of a recent model would make a bit more sense in my personal opinion.

Edit: nice refutes and debate. When in doubt and not intelligent enough to debate, just downvote!

Shitty article, “Apple finally admits”. Yet this is all that was said:

>> "We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we'll go down that path." -Phil Schiller [as if this guy is representing all of Apple]

He didn’t say anything about the iPad not replacing your PC, he just said that the Mac is the best personal computer. It amazes how editors can allow this stuff to pass.


[deleted]


For about 90% of what I do on a computer (reddit, YouTube/Netflix, news consumption), I much prefer using my iPad.

But for that last 10% (audio recording/production, programming hobby projects), it is either hell to do it on an iPad, or impossible.


The day I can program and run full IDEs on an iPad is the day I would consider switching from a MBP

Edit: Yikes, some people got a little too heated over this idea lol. It was just an off comment about how I'd *consider* it, and it'd have to be very good. Debugging interfaces would be a lot less annoying to use with a touch screen, that's most of where my basis for the comment came from.


This isn’t gadget news, it’s an opinion piece.

I stopped reading when he mentioned his old 12 inch MacBook Air.


"Finally admits"

&#x200B;

Steve Jobs clearly laid out that the iPad wasn't supposed to replace the PC, it was supposed to be an in between device, placed between cell phones and computers. Thus far, it has been wildly successful at filling that role.


Wtf is this fucking headline...


Why tf would a tablet replace a pc?


When ipad can run destiny 2 then I will consider getting it to replace my gaming desktop.


Who the hell was waiting for Apple to "finally" admit that they aren't replacing the your PC with an iPad?! They just released a new MacBook Pro and Mac Pro..... Who in their right mind thought they'd replace it after releasing two products that indicate the opposite in such a short period of time?


I beg to differ.  I know multiple people who have replaced their PCs with iPads.  I couldn’t but many can.  For what you are paying for apple products they should replace things like pcs


[deleted]


The entire premise of this article is full of shit.   It would be fine if they added “for everyone” to the end.  But fact is, the iPad does replace and is been superior to a laptop for many.  Not everyone but for that girl in the commercial and others she represents it was probably true.  And for enough of us it’s absolutely true.   For those who it’s not,  they should use what helps them get shit done.  No big deal really.


This "article" is one of the worst I've ever read.


The worst part of this interview is his comment stating that kids with chromebooks will fail at school. I mean seriously, chromebooks offer a cheap solution to low income communities. You have to be such a humongous asshole to criticize low cost products that allow more people to be connected and to learn.  

If you're going to do that then offer a laptop in the under $200 range that is usable. When the cheapest computer you offer cost $1000, you have no right to criticize low cost laptops.


For the life of me I don't understand why they don't make a dock for the ipad pro that's just a macbook pro without a screen. When they're docked, it's a full-fledged MBP with a touchscreen, better GPU, SSD, and the other bells and whistles. When undocked it's an ipad and a headless unit you can plug into a monitor.

Yeah, it'll  be pricey but I'd buy the pair.


I used to work for a company that did Apple tech support and the amount of idiots who thought it was just another PC was astounding. Here is an example of every time I got this. 

Me: ok we need a computer to restore your phone.

Customer: Ok where do I go. 

Me: Open iTunes and plug in your phone. 

Customer: I don’t see iTunes but I do see music but I can’t plug-in my phone. 

Me: what kind of computer do you have?

Customer: I have an iPad. 

Me: no the iPad is not a computer. 

Sad part was I would expect that from the older generation but a lot of them were in their 20s and 30s


It already could if they just gave me a damn Terminal.


*- So long, and thanks for all the fish.*


Oh, but... it has, literally, for me. I am one of the self imposed test subjects of this. My triple head PC setup has sat unused for nearly 4 years as a result of migrating all of my studio and daily driver workflow to two mobile devices, for the latter part of those years- an iPad Pro. It can be done.  

As for a keyboard, I’ve been using the Logitech Create keyboard, of which I have gone though three warranty replacements because I wore the volume buttons out, but other than that they are absolutely brilliant.


This is clickbait and this does not belong on the front page people should read the article before upvoting


Such a nicely sensationalized title when the one relevant fact provided is that Mac released a 16-inch MacBook Pro. That's it.

I'm sorry, did the author think Apple was abandoning the MacBook Pro sometime soon? What leap of logic am I missing, and why have 23k people upvoted this?


iPad replaced my PC some time ago.


Zdnet? Seriously?


Ok, but a PC won’t replace my iPad Pro


[deleted]


It can... For some. Most people use their pcs for YouTube, fb, Instagram... Netflix and for those uses iPad will provide a better ux and battery life than a $300 laptop with washed out 1366x768 display and Intel celeron / pentium silver cpu. If you're planning to anything more serious I would wait a few more years before considering.


The iPad has a 2.26 GHz, eight-core, 64-bit processor and a 7-core GPU.

It has up to 6gb of LPDDR4 RAM and up to 1tb of local storage.

It has a 2732x2048 display and stereo sound.

It has a keyboard and, at last, support for a mouse with an actual mouse cursor.

It has onboard WiFi and Bluetooth.

As a hardware device, it fully qualifies as a computer. It’s more powerful and has more resources than most budget laptops that run Windows 10.

There is no technical reason that the iPad Pro could not function as a full-fledged computer. The limitations are purely software. iPad OS does not function as a full-fledged desktop OS because Apple does not want it to compete with its own pricier desktop machines. The End.


Only reason I’m considering an iPad is for work since remoting in to my desktop is always an exercise in frustration. And unless I’m writing code, iPad would do fine.

I mean all they have to do is put Mac is on the damn thing and smash them together, tablets just aren't very useful in general apart from having a larger screen than a smartphone.


When I first heard the phrase "iPad Pro" I really hoped it would run OS X and be a competitor to Microsoft Surface. I'm still disappointed that's not what it is to this day.


> The company's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller... offered CNET these life-affirming words: "We believe the best personal computer is a Mac, and we want to keep going down that path. And we think the best tablet computing device is an iPad, and we'll go down that path."

Sooo the headline is totally editorialized right?


iPad is getting closer and closer to replacing a laptop, for most people. 

It already is for a lot of people.


To me the ipad Pro should have been a full fat mac os, aka a mac version of the surface pro


It was never Apple’s intention to make the Mac Book obsolete. If they wanted to make the iPad Pro a one stop powerhouse they would’ve done it by now. I have the iPad Pro and it’s great for my needs. Photo editing, web browsing, media consumption, and gaming.


lol they never claimed it would replace your PC


Remember that stupid ass commercial of the little girl lying in the grass playing with her ipad when her mother asks "what she's doing on the computer" and she replies with "what's a computer?".  How the mighty have fallen.


WhAt'S a CoMpUtEr?!


I have an ipad pro and a macbook pro.  
Personally I think the apps are the reason why it can't replace a PC. There are too many differences and lack of features in the ipad apps vs the PC version. Especially in the office/adobe/google apps. With using a mouse, it is still not as fast and easy to use, and many features are either missing or harder to use.  
  
If developers take the ipad and consider it as a PC, and make their apps to accommodate it, it could replace most lightweight PCs.


So glad the leading company on telling me what a pc is, isnt going to replace my pc with an ipad pro. Phew, gosh, dodged one.


Just like saying a iphone would replace an ipad, something its not meant to be


That's because they just released a new pc


Too late. Already, a bunch of idiots at my work bought them to replace their laptops and now I have to support them when they have problems getting into Citrix.


It will replace your wallet with air for sure


Did I really need Apple to tell me?


Replaced it for people like my mom who only email and browse the web. She's literally never needed a computer since getting an iPad. Any nutless monkey who uses a computer for real work could've figured this out though....


>Two years ago, Apple presented an ad in which a young woman, devoted to her iPad Pro, claimed not to even know what a computer was.

That kind of attitude is all you need to know about Apple.


Nothing will ever replace my PCs. Or my servers. Or my tablets. Each one has its purpose and trying to pretend that one "replaces" the other is just marketing nonsense.


This is fake news. If it was really Apple the topic would'ha been more like.

"Apple finally admits iPad Pro won't replace your *MacBook*"


Not even their stupid 4000$ Mac Pro will be capable of replacing my PC

I mean, then your smart phone also replaces your pc lol


Not necessarily in that order...Amiright.


But *does* it run Porn?


I use it for art and it’s one of the best tools I’ve ever used bar none. But that is also kind of a limited audience.


Email is so quaint. There is social media, the single hub enabling casually stalking exes, getting worked up about made up political stories and liking a cliche repost of a cute cat video.


Watching porn without adblock sounds like hell


And email and porn are all that 90% of the general populace use their PCs for. 

The average user can get by with just a web browser, and email client, a word processor, a calendar/address book/scheduling program, a spreadsheet editor, and a presentation tool. And an iPad or Chromebook has all that built in.


Yeah it was a pretty terrible article.


I fucking love "admits" in headlines. It's so dramatic. I picture a collective group of engineers, product managers, executives, and salespeople, some sullen, some sobbing, some clenching their fists, absolutely defeated, admitting to their dark conspiracy at a press conference.

Trash article. I’m surprised this isn’t the highest comment. The reason for why the ipad can’t replace a computer for this guy is because you probably use the ipad pro on a desk. Oh lord.


There’s like 0 substance in this article, I’m sorry I even clicked to see what it was about.


Hat's off to people like you who actually read the article and let us know the relevant info.


Unfortunate in many of the smaller online news sources “Editors” are now just people that keep an eye on their google ad account stats and fire the writers that aren’t hitting their goals.


What did you expect? It’s zdnet


Headline is to draw in readers. Never understood why people get so upset at technicalities like this.


This is what I thought who from apple was even saying the iPad was to replace PC? Articles are ass nowadays

God that ad pissed me off so much


A PC or a computer is something that is superior to iPad Pro.

I'm a computah. Stop all the downloadin


Same with Chrome books. They are "90% machines"


This. The iPad is a great piece of gear, but there's no way in hell I'm going to code on that flimsy "keyboard".

Also, iPad games are simply bad, despite Apple Arcade (which, truth be told, improved the situation a bit).


Exactly. I only use my laptop for work.


That's basically the problem I have with the iPad Pro. You *can* use it as a work computer if you do *really* basic stuff, but at that point you're paying extra for what is essentially a glorified tablet that a normal iPad can do no problem and you can save yourself a ton of money.

Once you actually need to do some work you're far better off with a Surface because of iOS' obnoxious limitations. Sure it's not a great experience as a tablet but it's a hell of a lot better to actually use as a laptop replacement.


Don't you get riddled with ads? I was thinking of buying ipad for that purpose but the fear of not being able to use adblock means I won't touch one even with a tenfoot pole

I still struggle quite a bit to do design work on my iPad, there are some phenomenal drawing apps and adobe has some killer iPad apps as well but none of them replace my laptop.

This is why I love my ASUS Transformer Chromebook. It has a keyboard,touchscreen, has good battery life, is light (easy for traveling). Sucks for photo editing, but that's when I use heavy duty stuff.


It's almost as if you... use the right tool for the job.


I actually do most of my music stuff on my iPad, cause the apps I have make it way easier to get ideas recorded quickly. When I try to do the same in Ableton on my PC, I take forever to choose the right VST and before I know it, the idea is gone.


This is ultimately why I *did* buy an iPad.

I could get a more powerful PC and the iPad for less than what a MacBook Pro would have run.

Because I have a desktop that isn’t with me all the time, i have a much easier time with work/life balance.

Why? What is the difference in usability between windows and an apple when comparing simple things like these?


Honestly, it's only a matter of time until audio production is removed from that list. I've been pretty impressed by what you can do with the current app selection (on the latest iPad mini no less). The specs and audience are there, it just needs main stream support (looking at you Ableton).


Tablets are for consuming. 

Computers are for creating.


I prefer a chromebook, Dell Chromebook i3 has served me well. I like typing on a real keyboard (backlit yay), have access to android apps (only use a torrent app rn), plus I use a google phone and I guess I'm in their ecosystem


I recently got a 15 inch thin and light 2 in 1. Basically replaced my phone and desktop for almost everything. It has enough power to program and the touchscreen is perfect for art. My poor desktop is only used for occasionally playing video games.


Yeah, my old surface pro 3 got me through several semesters of computer science classes. An iPad will never pull that, off..

Theb it died one day and I had to tear the screen off to salvage the ssd, but it was an unbeatable formfactor for college. Still miss sitting on the couch doing real work while the wife watches Netflix. My laptop is a little clunky for that :/


same goes for me and my chromebook. mostly for internet browsing, reviewing photos on vacation, and sometimes controlling my tv when my phone isn't  within reaching distance.


I really wish Apple would develop some sort of native text editor or IDE. I have no problem getting on my PC to work on my big projects, but being able to work on some algorithms or little coding challenges easily on my phone or iPad would be cool.

I know SoloLearn is out there, but I’m not a big fan of the app.


Facts


Basically, tablets are for consumption of media, PCs are for production.


I agree with this, but a large chunk of the population doesn't even have anything but a phone. I would say that a majority of Apple's clientele would do just fine with an iPad pro and no other laptop or desktop.


I like working on open source projects but, currently I do not have access to a personal Laptop. So, I created an EC2 instance on AWS and I am SSHing to it using terminus on my iPad. Everything works well after setting up vim with the appropriate plugins, it is just the lag which is annoying.


Mine suits 100 percent of my needs. The only problem I had was with typing and moving that cursor around. But now with the keyboard and mouse it’s totally fine for me


I run more projects in Auria Pro on my IPad Pro than in Logic on my Mac Pro. iOS music production is only going to keep improving, and with photoshop and all the awesome programs available it has all but replaced my computer. The touchscreen features save so much time, and the Fab Filter plutons cost a fraction what the do for desktop. Photo and Video editing is faster in my experience as well. There’s still some things I prefer the desktop for, and programming I’m sure would be one of them. Professional audio production is entirely possible and in my experience I proved on the iPad Pro.


I used to sell computers, tablets, and cell phones for 6 years. I'd say for about 60% of adults I encountered, everything they used a computer for (almost exclusively email, web browsing, and social media) could be done on a tablet with little-to-no effect on the user experience. Could even be done exclusively on their smartphone if they don't mind the smaller screen. 

Regardless, there's still more than enough people that legitimately need a computer to where I don't see them going away anytime soon. I don't even see why they should go away, a tablet is naturally an intermediate option between a smartphone and a computer. Making it a computer replacement essentially just makes it more computer-like than tablet-like.


Netflix and YouTube are kind of annoying on Apple's tablets, because they have more black bar than useful screen m when watching videos.

I'm okay with it on OLED screens, but on LCDs, it's a bit distracting.


Maybe it's just me being used to a specific thing, but I feel so constrained when doing anything on a mobile os. Granted, I haven't used tablets in a while, but I still prefer to do everything on a computer. I feel much more "free" so to speak with a better overview of what tabs and programs I have open and have an easier time switching between them


I believe before that day comes, your *smartphone* will be smart and powerful enough to do all the things your current PC can do. Because there will be no line to separate what's a phone, what's a tablet, and what's a PC, there'll be only one mighty device embedded inside you!


You'd still get only one screen and a shitty keyboard. That's a no from me.


Samsung has something called Dex.

Dex is Samsung’s desktop type environment for android. It works on their recent tablets as well as smartphones.

Linux on Dex was a full Linux VM running on Android with a full Ubuntu desktop. It was arm based but you could still run A full IDE.

Unfortunately Samsung recently announced that they have stopped development on it and won’t be moving forward with android 10.

It was so exciting and one of my reasons for purchasing a Note 10+ but apparently Samsung never added support for the Not 10 series.

Samsung is missing a big opportunity here.


But that’s the thing. Different uses.

This whole fucking computer thing is stupid to the bones.

I code as my daily job. The iPad Pro is next to useless for that.

I also draw and do illustrations. For that my laptop is a brick.

The “what’s a computer” was spot on. Think about what you need, and a tablet may become your daily driver. Or not. It depends on a fuckton of things.


webapps. [vscode on the server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) or [cloud9](https://c9.io), or whatever else


Wait...full? Can you run IDEs on iPad?


if u have an old computer u can use as server or just spin up something in AWS/GCP, use code-server

basically VSC online for free (well except for the server cost)


I mean, with docker containers and things like Visual Studio Online, that’s not that far away.


It’s also just pure bullshit and sensationalism. No one said that iPads will kill all laptops and desktop computers. 

But for the average person, iPads/tablets absolutely *have* replaced computers. Plenty of my less-techie family members have gone that route and are perfectly happy. 

But this is reddit where everything apple does is bad.


Based on literally two sentences from a CNET interview.


“Apple bad” will always get upvoted in here


Throw him on the pile over at r/quityourbullshit


You fool. Imbecile. You weak-minded normal. I never started reading at all!

You're the fifth top level comment I read, and thus I have all of the information I need about this article, including knowledge of how iPads work and how they are used (despite never having used an iOS device in my life) and the general public's opinion on the iPad, as well as the socioeconomic impact the iPad Pro has had on Nicaragua.

After submitting this comment, I will close this tab and only consider returning if I receive a reply that allows me to argue you should buy a $200 Chromebook, supported by my made-up statistics of eye socket injuries involving the iPad Pro.


I am not sure Apple ever made a 12” MacBook Air. 11”, yes. 13”, yes. And I believe the 12” laptop was just MacBook.


Tim Cook did a whole ad campaign where he used his iPad Pro instead of a laptop. 

TL;DR iPad can replace your workflow when it involves firing off emails to your two assistants


Yeah, it’s a bullshit article


Jobs has been dead for awhile now and had no influence on this ad campaign, which proposed the iPad pro as an alternative to traditional PC's.


Yeah it's like the world was holding Apple accountable for outrageous claims or something? The post title is some seriously strawman shit.  

Love my iPad, but thinking it would be a laptop or desktop replacement is just... dumb.

My surface pro has replaced a PC for me and I do design, music production and motion graphics.


Because they want to compete with the surface and other small touchscreen PCs. The problem is because of their siloed product lines all they can do is marketing.


For a good majority of people it can. I do 90% of my work through my phone.


It wouldn't. But a tablet PC can replace a tablet, oddly enough. Just ask the makers of the MS Surface.


Well, because Apple thought it could.

Feel sorry for Apple's heartbreak.


> Why tf would a tablet replace a pc?

Because not everyone is a gamer or professional, for the average home user, the iPad replaced their PC years ago


Don't worry, they'll make an Eververse app so you can shop on your iPad! /s

They arent going after that market. People with gaming PC's make up a fairly small proportion of the market, and they wouldnt be caught dead with any sort of all-in-one anyway.


Apparently a lot of idiots on Reddit.


Yeah this argument is stupid...like saying a Tesla can replace gas cars. Then people start getting outraged saying no I need a truck to haul equipment, or I travel cross country too often for electric to be feasible, etc. For the average person this will work, but there are always people who need specialization.


> For what you are paying for apple products they should replace things like pcs


When it comes to tablets, the Apple tablets aren't really that expensive for what you get. The 11 inch ipad pro goes for around 700-800€ (with the smallest storage), and has a faster processor than most ultrabooks out there (unless they cost twice as much or more, so the high end business ultrabooks). And even then, an ultrabook will weigh a lot more and have worse battery life. The Windows tablets odn't come close in performance either...


A lot of the younger people that I work with and by that I just mean a few years younger, like early 20s, don’t even own computers. Most of them buy the largest phone they can or just use a tablet. The thing is, almost everybody streams now. There’s no need for a lot of physical media and the average user doesn’t really need a computer anymore. Again just average I mean like average average.


Especially for school


I literally just bought an iPad Pro to replace my PC laptop when traveling. What a load of shit article.


Serious question: do you consider a Mac/MacBook a PC?


PC is a huge category, and the iPad definitely falls into it. Different PC's do different things. I wouldn't use my Lenovo Yoga to run Final Cut Pro. Does that speak to some kind of failure on the Lenovo's part? No. The whole argument that Apple was trying to replace the PC category, as opposed to broaden the definition (which they were), is retarded.


The iPad Pro is not $300, for one thing - it's $800 minimum. If you're spending Pro money, you can buy a hell of a lot better of a tablet PC - like a Surface Pro or a Thinkpad X1. There's no denying those devices have much greater versatility than the iPad Pro.

You can use a mouse, a regular keyboard and a regular screen with an IPad.

The problem is not really the hardware. The problem is lacking software and the minimal configuration we typically carry around with us.


When GarageBand came out for iOS I was like “holy shit! I can record basic tracks without setting up my whole rig”. Then I used it and was like “holy shit! I can’t believe I thought I could record basic tracks without setting up my whole rig”.


>Also, iPad games are simply bad

Many are, but there are some absolutely amazing games available.

Darkest dungeon, Shadowrun, Baldur's Gate, XCom, Hearthstone, The Room, Stardew Valley

Everything I've listed (except Darkest Dungeon) is also available on Android and make for great tablet games.


My work requires a 50/50 split of tablet and laptop. The laptop work is so very basic. It really is a pleasure using these devices. It's legit exactly 100% what I need for specific purposes. I was looking at laptops and digital cameras and tablets and said just pulled the trigger on a Surface and it's been a dream ever since. Ease of use is great. It doesn't work in some situations as I had imagined (not sure exactly what I was thinking), but through-and-through I recommend these. I haven't been so happy with a device in awhile. I almost want a new one for personal use but I need to upgrade my phone, and that's almost just as good.

I don't like how my left ring finger falls on the keyboard but I suspect that's one of those things that varies wildly.


IPad Pros revolutionized the tattoo industry in 6 months.  A few years ago everyone.  And 6 months later every single artist I know switched and hasn’t really looked back.  I haven’t touched my home computer in months.


You can actually download free adblock apps like 1Blocker as long as you have a 64bit device. The only ads that it can’t block from my experience is youtube and twitch.


Pay $2 for AdGuard. Free version only blocks ads in safari. Paid blocks ads in every app. If you want to block ads on your phone data and not just your home network. Haven’t seen a banner ad in 2 years even in scummy free games that throw them at you.


Buy a $25 Raspberry Pi, load Pi-Hole on it, plug it into your network. Problem solved. ;)


You can use the Brave browser or the Firefox Focus ad blocker in Safari.


AdGuard works pretty well.


*AdBlock Pro for Safari* blocks ads really well compared to others I've tried, including YouTube ads.


You can buy a keyboard for your tablet.  Its just really awkward to use on the toilet.


I hold the iPad vertically when typing comments, then I can use my thumbs and I’ve actually gotten fairly fast with it. I can still type faster on a real keyboard, but I love the interface and form factor of a tablet so much that it is worth it for little reddit comments. If I had to type something really long, I’d go to my computer though.


Browsing net is more fun in tablet than PC for me.


The bottleneck isn't power, my phone is 20 times faster than the laptop I used to dev on in the 90s.

The limitation is the interface, you simply don't have as much control and precision on a phone as you do with a screen and a mouse.

Someday when voice recognition is better maybe someday we'll be able to use that but until that happens keyboard and mouse the best input devices.


Jonny Pneumonia!


The iPad Pro absolutely tears up most laptops from a few years ago - it's ridiculous that Apple continues to cripple it by not releasing Xcode or truly desktop class browsing (looking squarely at devtools).

iPadOS was a great step forward, I hope they keep going much further...


Can't chat physics, no matter how powerful a phone becomes, if you can fit several phones (volume) worth of processers in a desktop, the desktop is more powerful. As technology advances and the phones are more powerful than today's most powerful desktops, we'll need even more powerful desktops to develop on.

My laptop has a "mobile processor" hexa core, 200$ and it does a lot of things. Soon those cheap devices will do all we need.

Would love a system where you hook up your phone to a couple of screens, keyboard and mouse... and use something other than android. Heard those Linux phones are in the making for 2020...


Multiport docks exist. Look at how DeX worked prior to the latest iteration. Could even install versions of Linux on it that had IDEA.

Wait, when did they announce that?!? Thays half the reason I got a tab.


So that's why the Dex was always sold-out. It was a really great idea that your phone doubled as an NUC.


Pretty much sums up my experience when I had the iPad Pro. The closest I ever did to programming on that thing was editing python and batch scripts through an SSH client - but of course that doesn't count because I'm using a remote machine for it...

That said, my current laptop is a Lenovo Miix and it does just as well with drawing as a current gen base iPad does. Not as good as the pro due to its slight screen gap, but it makes up for it with plenty of software support and of course **useful** adobe software. I don't plan to go back to an iPad Pro - my next device will be a Thinkpad X1 which is pretty much the perfect hybrid device right now.


I know there are toy Python apps for iPad which might meet someone's definition of an IDE. But let's remember this is a device with no user visible file system.


What sort of stats are we talking about?

I'm not using apple products, but now you've got me thinking that I should sell my recently upgraded gaming rig and buy a cheap chromebook instead.


Damn you didn’t have to take us all apart like that


I should feel insulted. I'm gonna go eat some Cocoa Pebbles and process this.


And the MacBook 12” was pretty much a iPad motherboard with a keyboard and a macOS.


I just don't understand why they're pushing that narative now. Wouldn't they rather sell macbooks that cost more?


You should look into getting a Plex server set up in your house. Start ripping your blue rays. Then you also have backups of all of them and its less wear on the disks.


Only tangentially related but I wholeheartedly agree. Some people don't really need a computer. My mom insisted that she needed an iMac. She spent $2k+ on it, probably closer to $3k. And she spends 90% of her screen time watching Hulu on her iPad and 9% on her very expensive iMac checking Facebook and then the 1% on her phone. I mean it's her money. She can spend it how she wants. But man. It is a very expensive Facebook machine.


I don't know the bitrates and such. But maybe setup a Plex server and rip the blu-rays to it?. Still involves something like a PC to serve it. But it could remove the need to touch a PC on a daily basis.


I don't think it's impossible. It might even work today. ipadOS now has a files app, so if you hook up a USB thumb drive, it shows up. I wonder if hooking up an external powered blu ray drive would work the same way.


I mean an iPad Pro does what probably 90% of consumers need. The biggest thing is enterprise really. Enterprise still needs a traditional computer. 

However I strongly believe that era is coming to a close.


The surface pros look amazing. Pros of both a tablet and a PC.

But goddamn, they're expensive.


A tablet would never replace a pc for me since I use my pc for gaming, programming(web development), virtual machine stuff, playing guitar(on a DAW), etc...


But the Surface Pro is a PC running PC software on PC chips!


So you replaced a PC with a PC?


I did fully replace my laptop tho.


“What’s a computer?”


iPad pro completely replaced everything I needed my laptop for.

It cannot do everything, but wow is it an effective tool for so much, especially for my graphic work.

The article you linked is one long brand-biased yawn.


I mean it absolutely has for a good chunk of computer users. 

I get that people are just looking to bash apple in here but it’s true. No one claimed “iPads will make all computers and laptops obsolete,” but for the average Joe who just needs email/browsing/some apps, an iPad is perfect for them.


Hm well, I think it's because Apple was hoping their customers would think so, increasing sales, I mean this "replace desktop" thing is as old as the road to rome, even the rpi4 did it


But it can. This article is garbage a misleading.


I mean, it's way more powerful and useful than, say, a chromebook.

But must they always lack any hint of self-awareness?


Nobody actually cares about the reality. Apple discussion on reddit comes from people who don’t buy or research Apple products, they just parrot the same handful of talking points over and over. For some reason getting angrier and angrier over a product they will never use.


Oh yeah lol. Fuck that commercial.


I’m gonna say $7,000 just to keep this going.


People think that the Mac Pro and MacBook Pro are desktop/laptop cut from the same cloth.  But they serve dramatically different end users

A MacBook Pro is great for developers and some pro work on the go. 

A Mac Pro (especially the new ones) are great for people editing 4k+ video or doing editing of gigantic photoshop documents. It's massive overkill for something like web development. 

People seem to also have the same confusion by the XDR display when it comes to the stand and how it's sold separately.  Most pro environments would hate a bundled stand as they'd need to store them _somewhere_ and they probably have VESA mounts already setup in their studio.


He probably just plays games and doesn't realize the Mac pro is not made for him and his pcmasterrace ego.

Yeah its totally software. iOS’s local file management is difficult (*seriously, why is it so hard to save files locally or get files off them?!?*) and that’s why they are simply not viable for anything serious or work-related (much less completely replace a computer).


Knowing Apple, this is all very intentional to upsell consumers to iCloud. I have an iPad Pro and bought a couple nice styluses for graphic design work (including the Apple Pencil) but gave up on using it because the “ecosystem” is such a pain in the ass. 

The only time I use my iPad is to watch movies when i’m traveling. And even then it sucks - last time, I saved a few movies on it because I knew I wouldn’t have internet on my flight, but it still just refused to play them.

You can’t use the mouse in the same way you use it on a PC


Honestly it's a bit criminal we have such outstanding hardware like the iPad Pro 2019 combined with such a limited OS and sub-par software in 2019. Tablets are capable of so much more and yet it's merely the software side that's letting the whole thing down. I'm so glad Adobe is finally bringing desktop class Photoshop to the iPad, as I feel that's going to be the entry point for more serious desktop class apps to come to tablets.

The Microsoft Surface Pro line has shown that the form factor itself is 100% capable of doing proper professional work on it (Office, Photoshop, Coding) so realistically there's no reason why iPad or Android tablets can't do the same thing. We have the horsepower, it's the cart that's missing.

I always thumb text in my iPad.  Do people actually use all their fingers on tablets?  That's so strange.  My son does his homework on an iPad and thumb texts because it's faster for him than typing on his laptop.


Yeah, watching porn at a desk just feels like work.


>Someday when voice recognition is better maybe someday we'll be able to use that

Only if we move away from open floor plan offices (please god) and then only if you don't ever want to work in a public space or in a shared space at home.

(It might be possible to train the voice recognition program to respond only to your voice, but there's still the issue of lack of privacy, self-consciousness, and annoying/distracting everyone around you.)

I think a better bet would be on devices (external or implanted) to either detect subvocalization or directly detect and interpret brain activity.


I agree that the interface for phones is the limiting factor, that's why I'm looking forward to docking phone tech.

Ever since the Motorola Atrix phone was introduced, I have been looking forward to the day when phones can seemlessly dock so that you can carry everything with you.

Microsoft was starting to get into the concept just before they killed Windows Phone. Ubuntu also started investing into this but then they abandoned it.

Based on the latest Android release, there are hints that Google is looking into docks.

Samsung the only company currently pushing this tech with their Dex line up.


The way I’ve been comparing it is through music production. I can do a bunch of cool things on FL Studio Mobile, but it doesn’t even come close to what I can do on the desktop app


I can't tell if that was a typo or not

What if I want to develop for Django?


So why not use a Linux laptop at that point?


Huh, true I didn't think it could dock.


Having to carry a separate keyboard is far less convenient


Dex will still be there just no Linux on dex. Still sucks but you do have a desktop interface available


That totally counts. Many business use VDI on whatever endpoint they want. PC, Laptop, Thin Client, tablet, phone, etc.

Lots of people love VIM or Nano to code, so SSH from some endpoint is perfect for them.


> But let's remember this is a device with no user visible file system.

Did that not change with iPad OS?


Arguably one of the biggest screwups for the whole "replace your computer" argument. Not to mention the app suite. If it's basically iOS, then it won't replace your computer. Period.


> no user visible file system

Where have you been since iOS (11? 12?)


The newest findings in this field suggest that a whopping 84% of iPad Pro users and future buyers would in fact benefit from a $200 Chromebook in tandem with (14% of users) or instead of (70% of users) an iPad Pro because of the way the iPad Pro is used by the average consumer, which is partly thanks to modern gadget reviewers being uneducated in the field they operate in.

You see, though official Apple Pencil of Service do not explicitly state it, you are in fact _not_ encouraged to scratch your eyeball with the Apple Pencil, due to risks of the device getting sucked into the socket hole and severely damaging the bony structure of your eye's orbit.

And because $200 Chromebooks perform literally the same tasks as the iPad Pro -- owing thanks to their exact same ChromePadOS -- with the same speed, but do not come bundled with an Apple Pencil, everyone on the planet should own one. Preferably the 2015 Intel Celeron N3050 models with 32GB of eMMC memory and 2GB of RAM.


Apple is happy to sell you anything made by Apple, as long as that means you don't purchase a competitors' product. If that is an iPad instead of a MacBook, they'll happily take your money. Better than $0.


Because the average consumer only needs the functionality provided by a tablet (email internet entertainment etc). Tablets are cheaper, convenient, and overall more appealing to them. Largest market. I expect the laptop to become a power user device.


You would have better control and versatility with a NAS and SAMBA shares. Kodi is far better than Plex in so many ways. But if you really want the Plex type interface, you would be better off with Jellyfin since it is open source and doesn't cost money. I'm a big proponent of self hosting and controlling my own data so I avoid closed source subscription services. 

It's never been easier to self host with SBC's out now like the Rockpro64 or even a Pi4. I run a pihole, SAMBA shares, VPN, SSH tunnel, mumble server, Nextcloud server, MPD server, Wallabag server, and Bitwarden on one Rockpro64.


I highly highly doubt it.


That they are and even worse here in Europe!


I have an SP4 and it's been great. The battery life is absolute shit after three and a half years though. Apparently the newer generations have much better batteries but for the cost I'm not sure if I'll get another surface pro. If anything I'd get the surface book, the tablet part is nice but the kickstand is super annoying for small desks or lap use.


Apart from gaming, a surface pro is good enough for the other things. Well maybe not virtual machines, but programming, recording in daws and software instruments.


It's a tablet form factor.


Exactly this. Laptops are weak compared to desktops, and I don’t need power or a super precise interface when I’m out of the house.


I feel sorry for that girl.

And seething hatred.

The Mac Pro is filling kinda the same role as the old cheese grater Mac Pro.

The new XDR display is not in any way filling the same role as the old Cinema Display though. The XDR is for people who were previously spending 20k to 40k on color accurate monitors. The fact that Apple used to sell a thing that looks the same I do think causes confusion. It'd still be nice if they came out with another Cinema Display with the characteristics of the iMac 5K or 4K

The ironic thing about this ad is that *Apple makes computers*. Totally explains their neglect of the Mac line over the past few years

This. I would never make my primary device an iPad because I want to be able to download and use open source tools and apps and the App Store severely limits that ability.

The weird obfuscation of file structure at least dates back to the iPod, long before iCloud was a thing.


I have been smashing my head against a wall, watching hours of YouTube guides with people tapping that fucking pencil against the screen, just to do what I could do on a pc in one keyboard shortcut and a mouse click. I'm going fucking crazy. It's slowed down my flow for sure. Now I have to turn my laptop on, set up clip studio images with reference images and stuff, then go through an hour of sheer rage clouding it over to the IPAD, where I pay a subscription to a product THAT I ALREADY HAVE A KEY FOR, just so I can get some done outside of the house. I should have bought a surface pro.


I never had this issue with my iPad Pro. I use mine a lot for college. The only thing I can’t do as of now is download my templates. I download them off my computer and share it with my iPad. I’m studying accounting, so the ability to write notes in my excel workbooks is a huge plus. Especially when I am unsure if I’m doing something incorrectly and my instructor can read my notes and identify what I am doing wrong. I also have zero issues saving my work or keeping them organized in folders. However, I also save on iCloud and Dropbox. A few times my computer went into updates and I forgot to save my work has taught me to save like I’m playing fallout or skyrim. 

When I travel, I was always able to watch my downloaded movies. The only thing that sucked was when I traveled last, I was in my statistics class. I couldn’t run the statcrunch software. Despite doing the problems manually with all the formulas, I still needed statcrunch. I ended up taking a 10% dock on my grade to complete after it was due. 

The only games I play is vainglory and Minecraft. Yea, I still play Minecraft by myself and with my son. It’s soothing. Until my son messes up my game plan to build a city. I play on survival because I actually enjoy collecting materials and storing them in specific chests. My son comes along and takes all my materials for whatever project he has in mind. Smh


This is a problem with Android too. Every program has its own way of saving files in a relatively proprietary location. Either I'll have to figure out how to navigate there manually, or some app will try and autosearch every location things tend to be saved and present me with a long list of things which isn't really better, just different. There's not even really a usable default file manager I can rely on to brute force my way through things.


I love my surface so much. I was pretty skeptical about it cause its pretty compact and my wife likes to drop stuff a lot and blame the cats (rip Lenovo yoga) but the sales guy at best buy was like "na bro watch" and then smacks the hell outa the screen with his clipboard. Not. A. Scratch.


I was sold.


I have multiple surface devices and an iPad Pro. The surface is far more useful to the point that I don’t ever use the iPad, but the iPad is far smoother and has much better battery life. 

For example, despite Microsoft releasing multiple patches, the surface will still drain itself within two days in sleep mode. The iPad will still have charge a month later.


If Microsoft hadn't doubled and tripled down so hard on the lack of Thunderbolt 3 in the last few generations, I might actually have a Surface.


What do you like about the surface and which model? I have the surface book 2 (the laptop with the detachable screen) but I’m not in love with it. Partially because the 15” I bought was just too big. That was a miscalculation I think.

I think some of it is just getting used to it working differently but I think the full fledged Win10 might not be ideal for a tablet. It’s a bit non responsive at times and sometimes apps get into a weird state if they aren’t designed for full screen tablet mode.

Do you have any opinions on the Surface Pro X?


For tablet stuff, the iPad is absolutely leagues ahead of the surface to be honest. For a laptop, the surface does much better. 

Art is one of the biggest reasons to use a tablet, and the Apple Pencil is, so far, is streets ahead of anything but the most expensive Wacom screentablets.

For ad free mobile Youtube, use Youtube Vanced.


*AdBlock Pro for Safari* was free a few weeks ago and it's the only adblocker I tried that actually blocked ads on YouTube (in Safari) as well as other ads (i.e. reddit) that the other adblockers failed to get fully.


WireGuard, and enable the option to be enabled on demand everywhere except your home WiFi.

I use it for my mobile and work laptop, it’s amazing and still lets me use my full 4G speeds since it only routes LAN/DNS queries.


Sure... get a USB network dongle if you do that, though.


Wired Ethernet is better for an always-on network appliance. This can be a YMMV thing, but in general it’s not worth the possibility of instability.


Or just using the free NextDNS service to block ads *and* trackers?


Pi-Hole is software that blocks network requests to known ad servers, malware sites, porn sites, etc. It can run on lots of stuff but more people throw it on a cheap Pi.

It did. Time will tell how it will be used by apps in the future though - as of right now it's sort of just *there*.


Yes, in the files app


On top of that, Apple has already stated that they have no plans to merge OSX and iOS. That seems to be at odds with Apple's investment in ARM, so God knows what Apple is actually planning. 

iOS is fine for phones, but after that it's just a toy OS that serious developers, which is a huge chunk of the OSX market.


Oh I see. I have a tendancy to stick foreign objects in my eyes, I definitely blame the products lack of literature warning against doing so. I appreciate the heads up. That's one point towards the chromebook for not including the pencil in the first place.

As for the specs, all those numbers scare me but I did have a celeron processor in a computer once and it played solitaire exceptionally well. And since you guarantee full compatibility with apps I don't see any reason why anyone would want anything other than a chromebook!


Oh interesting. I know Plex has a NAS plugin. I use Plex because I got a deal on the lifetime subscription. I still control all my data obviously and Plex works great for me. What exactly am I missing by using that instead of one of the self hosting more open source options? Only thing Plex doesn't have I would want is the ability to share playlists with my users. 

Since I have a lot of casual users on my account its nice to direct them to a simple app like Plex with an easy interface. Especially since a lot of their smart tvs and such have the Plex server already on it. They are at least casually familiar with the app.


It is probably missing the drivers for such drives.


Tbh, I never really learned the difference between the different surface models.

From a cursory glance, the surface book is the one with the detachable keyboard thing? That one seems pretty cool.

There is no shortage of file browsers in android to suit every person. You just have to go to playstore and search.

What's an "office"?


The same reason people have been docking laptops since forever? When I'm at a desk I want a nice big screen and a loud as hell keyboard and so forth. Kinda hard to lug a PC tower to a Starbucks, though.

also, my personal use case for my iPad - it's the fastest for most of the things I do. Granted, if I were rendering video or compiling code this wouldn't be true, but I think quite a lot of people need short burst computing - add to a task manager, send an email, look something up on the web, documents, etc. iPad just does that the most reliably and quickest, most of the time for me.


Tbh, my theory for the past 4 years is that Apple doesn't really have a plan.

Like...I remember when they dropped the iPhone 7. No headphone jack. USB-A charger cord.

Like two months later, they drop their new mackbook pro. Only USB-C ports, and a headphone jack.

So their two flagship products can't even be like...plugged into each other.

Idk, it just seems like they don't have any unifying vision anymore.


If you already bought the lifetime subscription, then you are better off keeping it. For anyone that hasn't bought it, then Jellyfin would be better because it does the same thing without having to pay for it.

And anyone that doesn't need to share their library with other people outside of their own network, then I'd avoid all of those types of services (Plex, Emby, Jellyfin), and just setup SAMBA shares since there would be no reason for transcoding and it would put less strain on your server/computer.

What use cases is this good for? Genuinely curious.


An iPad is fine as a consumer device, and I mean that phrase literally, as a device for consumption of media. It's great for reading, memes, video, TV, photo browsing, messaging, and more. 

But it's not great for in-general computing.


To say Apple is a hardware company has to be one of the most ignorant comments ever, in my opinion. Final Cut Pro? iOS? macOS? GarageBand? HomeKit? Spotlight? I think these are all great examples of well-developed software created by Apple.

As long as you're willing to sacrifice the ability to repair it if anything goes wrong.


Thunderbolt 3 is basically direct access to 4 lanes of PCI Express, something like 40Gbps. One of the main things you can do is take a device that has a decent processor but doesn't have enough cooling ability to also have a decent graphics card (like an ultrabook or Surface) and connect an [external graphics card](https://www.amazon.com/Highpoint-RocketStor-6661A-Thunderbolt-Expansion/dp/B07CTL7XWJ/) to it while you're at home. That way you don't have to have a separate machine for gaming. 

That means you can also have an external solid state drive that you can access as fast as your built in solid state drive, and even boot from if you want. But it's more general than that, since USB is pretty good about actually being universal you can have adapters and hubs that do just about anything, at the same time. This also includes high definition video (if you have the graphics power), I believe multiple 4K monitors can be daisy-chained on the same connection. Each connection carries up to 100W of power for charging. So it also takes the place of all of those various proprietary docking station connections.

EDIT: https://youtu.be/cv-zdFK2MLM


E-gpu mainly, allowing machine to dock at home and do mild gaming.

A lot of people are happy to game at 1080, e-gpu are good enough for that. Having one device to go and gaming would be great.

It future proofs the purchase to an extant.


Monitors and specifically for me very specialized dsp boxes for audio/music stuff. 


Thunderbolt is pcie in a cable, its pretty cool.


I have a mobile external monitor that doesn’t require a separate power cable if you’re connected via USB-C.


egpu.... It's for people who want light devices which are as future-proof as possible. Even lame ultrabook CPUs are capable of playing most games if you have a decent GPU hooked up. But with EGPU, you can just unplug it and take the light portable device with you (while gaming laptops are heavy and have shitty battery life).



People hated the new macbook pros with just the two or four USB C connectors. But in a way, they are really cool if you have everything else set up properly. For example, you hook it up at home to an egpu, and it basically becomes a workstation (especially if it has a an intel H processor). But you can always simply take it with you to work ect... And all you have to do is connect a single USB C connector. You can even set it up so that you have a separate monitor, keyboard and mouse, all through a USB C connector... Yeah it's possible with cheaper laptops, with loads of connections, but it's hard for people to understand, that with the macbook pro, you definitely pay for the simplicity.


I use the TB3 port on my laptop daily. Single connection to the dock gives me power, gigabit Ethernet, two DisplayPorts, a TB3 out port, VGA, audio in/out, and I think four USB 3 ports. 

Try running two 4K monitors at 60 fps on a USB 3 dock.


Nothing will, YouTube's ads come from the same servers as their content, so you'd need a content-aware blocker, which has to run on the client


A mythical place where when you need to work you have the ability to physically separate yourself from others! It's a magical place where answering a phone call doesn't ruin the focus of those around you.

Only problem is I had to set up my monitors funky because I *cannot stand* having my back to a door.


> Kinda hard to lug a PC tower to a Starbucks, though.

Don't act like you actually get work done at Starbucks.


This is a very good point. I've chatted with some people who work at Apple and all of them say the same thing; teams are highly silo'd and rarely know what's happening outside of their group. I honestly wouldn't be surprised that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing internally at Apple.

I’d say multi use dongles, actually. 
 
One dongle that adds full hdmi, multiple usb A, as card reader, audio out, among other things. That’s a pretty great reason to have thunderbolt.

6/10 seems better than most tablets


It's actually pretty nice. It also supports resizing when used on a foldable. Something the original apple music android app still doesn't support.


And google releases features for iOS before android all the time


I would imagine most people play music from their phones as their primary device, so it makes sense to capture another group of mobile users before developing the iPad version. Gotta boost those sales numbers before the next keynote!


[deleted]


While this kinda cheeses me off as a classical music enjoyer, I gotta remind myself that apple is also a software developer that develops software for other platforms, not just it's own.

edit: typo fix


Any classical music fans have recos? I don't really know much about classical music, but I listened to the introductory series on Apple Classical so I have like... A very basic understanding. 

As a beginner I don't really know what's out there, but I think maybe the one thing that's really peaked my interest is Kronos Quartet and Laurie Anderson's Landfall. Anything anybody would recommend that's like that?  Or even if it's not like that. 

Thanks in advance!

There’s something really nice about the apple made android apps.


From someone who never made iPad calculator app, I am not surprised.


And? I mean, they are both mobile operating systems, and furthermore, they have said that they will release it only on iOS (for now, I think) since iOS is a mobile operating system like Android. I don’t see anything strange about this release.


I just wish they could separate Apple Music from iTunes.


Apple does not care about iPad.


Why is there a need for separate app for classical music?


I mean what's the surprise they did mention it was supposed to be a phone-only app


Almost as bad as Apple Music having cross-fade feature on the Android app and it's still nowhere to be seen on the iOS app all these months later.


So?


As I spend all day sitting at my mac with great speakers, it’s a no from me until there’s a Mac app.


Such a half assed app by Apple. And this is coming from someone who loves classical music.


Old technology, old music to go along with it.


Traitors.


The average age of android users....."..


I'm curious if anybody is experiencing the same thing: 

In Apple Music, when I click Airplay, it gives me the option at the bottom to "control other speakers and tv's". And I always use this because if I just choose my Apple TV or homepods from the list, then whatever I'm browsing on my phone will often start playing on the speakers. For example, if I'm listening to music and scrolling in Apollo (reddit client), if I come across a video I want to watch, it will play that audio over the speakers, overriding my Apple Music. 

But in Apple Classical I don't get the option to "control other speakers and tv's". Is this just not supported? It seems strange that I'd be able to do it through Apple Music but not Apple Classical.


I don’t have Apple Music sub so this app is not very useful as-is. If it helped me buy albums I might be.


Does somebody uses this?


I wonder if Google Play is collecting 30%


Would almost guarantee more people use their phone for music


Would be better if you didnt have to be an adult to listen to it… my kids can use my iCloud family account and use Apple Music to listen to crap but have to be an adult to listen to the classical app. Just plain stupid business


Okay.  Android phone numbers vs iPad and macs??


Shout out to https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idagio-classical-music/id1014917700

This team has been providing a stellar classical music streaming experience for years now. Apple’s foray feels very “what other small companies can we plunder margin from??”. Check out both before you default to the trillion dollar company. :)


Does anyone know of a process to submit corrections to mega data? Because I’ve come across a number of totally incorrect things on Apple Classical, misnamed tracks etc. Can you submit corrections like for Apple Maps?


The apple music app for Android is better than the iOS app lol


Still waiting for Apple TV for Android.


Pixel owner.. I could be tempted by this. Checking it out now.


More new customers to gain over the macOS users. Chances are if they would use it on macOS they already have it in iOS anyway. No sense in delaying the android release if it’s ready.


Still can’t directly download from the app either


Tech youtubers tomorrow: " apple is secretly ready to launch their foldable. Code has been found inside their latest classical music app for Android that has a foldable layout that resizes to the likes of z fold etc."


Ever since I messed around with the iOS version, I’m about 80% certain Apple Music Classical also is acting as a teaser for an eventual Apple Music redesign. It is a much nicer user experience than current Apple Music while not being too wildly different than the main app


Can someone explain this?


But google is everywhere and apple only begrudgingly releases on other platforms


But Android before iPadOS is potentially a surprise.  But, other than screen rotation not working as I'd expect the iOS version runs fine on iPadOS.  So Android is the smarter market share move in my mind.


What for example?


Yeah it makes total sense. Like, imagine being salty about someone else's mobile platform getting an app marginally quicker than an iPad or Mac.


honestly, with what Apple Music Classical offers anyway, i don't really see it being a pressing concern to have an iPad app. Since anything you add to your library from the classical app is also added to your library on the main app (thus allowing you to download as well), i can just easily add the classical stuff I find via Classical to my library, adn on my ipad just browse the regular app.


I’m curious how true that is for classical, specifically. I’m one data point, but though I would happily be a customer of this service, the lack of Mac app has kept me from subscribing.

I have no interest in classical on my phone, for two reasons.

1.	I have a DAC+amp and nice headphones permanently hooked up to my Mac. Any phone listening would be a downgrade. I expect many classical listeners have a similar setup.
2.	I want to listen to classical while I’m working, and thus stationary. A desktop/laptop makes more sense for that.

Again, one data point, but just as classical listeners have different metadata needs, it wouldn’t surprise me if they also have different listening habits than “normal” music.


They're separate engineering teams entirely, it's not about allocating resources between the apps. Android app engineers are not exchangeable for iOS app engineers.

Instead, what's likely is that like every other iPad and macOS app that's not important enough, they've diverted those engineers to other projects.


Looks like it doesn’t support Android Auto either. Just installed it on my Pixel and I don’t see AM Classical in the launcher.

in case you didn't already know, just wanted to mention you can air play from your phone to your Mac. I do this when I'm walking around my house because my mac is connected to my home theater system and nice speakers. It allows me to skip and control songs on my phone instead of having to walk back to my Mac.

Not sure if it works with Classical music app but it works with other things. Pretty sure it uses wifi like carplay but I'm not positive.


Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony. It’s the “poppiest” of all his symphonies, the principal melody introduced at the start is one of the sweetest ever written, and the whole piece interpolates a lot of rhythmic dance music of the day so it goes down easy.

Instrumental music doesn’t have to be *about* anything, obviously, but to me this one is about a mind being reborn out of depression, by embracing the world as joyful and heartbreaking simultaneously. The cello line out of the second movement turns melancholy out to find the beauty inside of it.

The doom-and-gloomy Fifth and formally innovative Ninth have had more ink spilled about them, but it’s not for nothing that the Seventh was the best-loved by the contemporary public.

I like the 1976 Carlos Kleiber version (fast! It feels like the orchestra is going to explode at the Vivace sections at the end of the first movement), but the editor’s pick is good too.

Not a specific composer or work but something I didn’t really grasp until recently.:

I knew that different performances or conductors were considered “better” but I didn’t really appreciate *how different* interpretations of works can be. And for earlier works (from before, say, mid 1700s) the instruments themselves can be quite different depending on whether “modern” classical instruments are used or period correct instruments are used. Unlike modern music we don’t have recordings of performances back then, so there’s no absolute “this is how it’s supposed to sound.”

So my recommendation is to not just consider which composer or work to listen to, but who the conductor/director and primary musicians are. And I’ve found, kind of like a pop music producer, if I really like a classical recording by conductor or musician that I can look for recordings they’ve done of other works and composers, letting their tastes guide me a bit.

Also as with pop music, different record labels, especially smaller ones, may tend towards a certain style or philosophy of interpretation. I recently got some recordings from a label called Carpe Diem, and a recording they have of a Hildegard von Bingen work is so good and in style was just a surprise to me. So there are surprises to be had even with works that have been around for 800 years. (So I guess that’s my recommendation, Hildegard von Bingen’s Vox Cosmica by Hirundo Maris (group name) on Carpe Diem Records. Btw it includes a few tracks that they composed themselves (modern meditations on the older music).

One more: Purcell’s (composer) King Arthur (work) by Lionel Meunier and Vox Luminis (the ensemble and founder) on Alpha Records. :)

Edit: Thanks for the gold! :)


In no particular order:

Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz, particularly movements IV and V

A Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky

The Planets by Gustav Holst, particularly Jupiter

Im wunderschonen monat mai by Robert Schumann for something “smaller” and vocal but indescribably beautiful

New World Symphony by Dvorak

Elsa’s Procession to the Cathedral by Wagner but specifically the arrangement played by the US Marine Band, the build to the end is the most powerful emotion music has ever made me feel and the most air I’ve ever had to push through my instrument when performing

Edit: I find romantic era music to be the most accessible on an emotional level, plus I think it can sound more familiar to our ears thanks to modern film scores. Baroque is fantastic and I love it but a lot of people I think are turned off by the rigidity with which it can be played today and the sometimes overwhelming technical complexity: it’s very mathematical music if that makes sense, but that’s my thing for sure so if you dig it great. Classical era music I find stuffy and uninviting; I think it’s why so many people think they don’t like what we call classical music! Totally just my opinion but I figured I’d throw it out there in case it resonates with anyone. 

If you wanna hear some REALLY weird shit, try finding some Renaissance or medieval music! It’s before we developed many of our modern musical conventions in the West so it often sounds surprisingly modern or forward thinking; not at all what we picture when we think of music from 500+ years ago. “Mal un mutta per effecto” is one piece from ~1500 that comes to mind that goes way harder than you’d expect.


If anyone is looking for _exciting_ classical music, here are a few ideas...

* ["Infernal Dance" from The Firebird](https://youtu.be/jmRU6cJeVDs) by Stravinsky
* The final 4 minutes of [Piano sonata no. 7 by Prokofiev](https://youtu.be/zptvLiMBn7E?t=858)
* [Piano concerto no. 2 by Prokofiev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pji4JURpe5Q) – especially the [climax](https://youtu.be/Pji4JURpe5Q?t=530) leading up to the full orchestra joining in at 11:16
* The opening of [Piano concerto no. 1 by Brahms](https://youtu.be/arKoBwtmuX0?t=28)


The iOS version isn’t CP-enabled? 🤔 Forgive me for the question. I don’t even use the regular Apple Music; still seems like a glaring oversight for an audio app.


I mean, at this point the difficulty of making apps work at different device screen breakpoints is overstated, and the variety in the iOS display landscape is far understated.

Also, things like Jetpack Compose make Android development a breeze.


Parity for the (contemporary) Music which is already on Android. It would be weird for them not to offer it.


I agree but kinda weird iPad didn’t get it also, kinda shows iPad as low priority since it would be relatively easy


The iOS app works OK with iPad, though they probably figure phones are more likely to be used when commuting and at the office than iPads.


Same reason podcasts are separate to music despite both being audio experiences.

A “Song” in Music is very different to a “Track” in Classical.


The categories of metadata needed for accurately describing a classical music recording are very different from what’s typically used for contemporary.

For instance, I’m sure you’re familiar with sorting your music by Artist/Group, Album and Genre. But with classical you need Composer and Conductor, you’re not normally looking for the writer (a lot of Pop music is ghostwritten by someone other than the artist) or the guy running the mixing equipment. And you also need to know the Orchestra or even specific instrumentalists, whereas you’re not necessarily looking for a specific guitarist for a band that may have changed members over the years.


Had the same thought. 

This seems very, very bad for streaming apps. If people think it’s going to be one subscription forever they’re kidding themselves.

Edit: hey downvoters, come up with a single good reason for segmenting music apps.


That’s odd.


I think Apple classic is build on a better base than the normal.apple music,the app is Soo smooth ,i love it


honestly foldables are the only thing tempting me to android, none of the other features reasons that they advertise rlly speak to me but that’s just so cool. it took to the 12 series for me to leave my 6s and i think the only thing that’ll get me off this is a folding iphone. but if i could get one that is half the size when im not using it????? i love them so much

I would agree, makes a lot of sense


Different teams and orgs have different development processes and timelines. 

It's not one person or one team doing all these platforms at the same time themselves.


It makes sense that the release of a service based app is prioritised on platforms that have more users.


Apple has an incentive to hold releases for big updates because it will attract more attention that way. Point releases in apple’s ecosystem are generally small features or small tweaks. 

Apple has no incentive to wait for the iOS release before releasing it on android because those users are far less likely to follow apple’s releases. 

It’s all about catering to the Apple user who will amplify the news of new releases and be excited to read about the new Apple features. Apple also likes to omit features so their users will complain and talk about those omissions and generate hype for when those features are actually released. The iPhone 4 being the first iPhone with a camera flash is a perfect example of this. Omitting 3G on the original iPhone is another. Omitting video recording until the 3GS is another. Omitting MMS messaging until iOS 3 is another.


Easy. The people doing the ios Apple Music app have lots of other tasks.  The people doing the android Apple Music app have one task.

Same in reverse on Google.


If I had to guess, it's probably because a lot of their mobile developers use iOS. Obviously there are tons of Android users inside the Android company, but I would guess iOS is over-represented on their mobile dev team.

But also, Google is a horizontal services company at heart. They're not interested in propping up Android at the expense of their cross-platform services like YouTube, Gmail, Docs, etc.


In this case? My guess is WWDC. Or they just don’t give a rat’s tuchus about iPadOS or macOS


Big company with different teams and management and issues on different platforms. They map it how it makes sense based on priorities, resources, etc. Sometimes they want to make things line up, but sometimes it’s just whoever gets there first.


It’s based on which group make the company the most money. Google makes more money from iPhone than from Android.

You can just use the service to pick out stuff to listen to, add it to your library, and listen on your Mac.

Or just add a lightning adapter to your DAC/amp setup.


That makes more sense. Those engineers are probably being reallocated to making sure the XR headset has iPad apps that function correctly.


That's weird, when I tap on any of these links, it doesn't open up Apple Classical, it opens up the App Store to download Apple Classical... Which I already have installed.


It wasn’t as of recently but need to check again.

Edit - just checked. Phone has Classical Music app loaded, doesn’t show on CarPlay. Also no service for Sonos yet either.


> still seems like a glaring oversight for an audio app.

It’s not quite as bad as that, since AM Classical as it is is designed mostly for discovery, and can easily kick playback and download over to the Apple Music mothership app by adding stuff to your library.

I hope they polish it up and add offline playback and all that, but it’s excellent as it is.


You can play audio from any app on CarPlay, it’s just that there isn’t an icon for it on the CarPlay screen. This isnt surprising as there are almost no apps that add to the CarPlay screen. Like there are maybe a dozen apps and 90% are Apple stuff with Google maps being an exception.


Thanks, that makes sense.


I'll give it a whirl. The metadata needed to keep classical organized is immensely more intricate than standard songs. You can have a single classical "song" if you will but it could have been played by 1000 different orchestras in hundreds of ways and multiple variations. 

Sure you have a cover songs by various artists but it's like classifying grains of sand. Sure it came from the beach but which beach and then which era of geology and then what material is that grain of sand made out of and so on. 

The standard music app would be a discombobulated mess with all the variations of classical thrown in. You'd be trying to pinpoint a specific classical piece using a hammer rather than a scalpel. 

There's no reason for another subscription, there's a need for the indexing of the music to be separate though.


Yepp, the base support in Android Studio is just way easier to add when you are creating a new project. Upgrading an already made project is the hard part, thats why you see many devs rename the old version “classic” or “deprecated” and create a new version which does not have old android elements, so it can utilize the new APIs found for something like Bubbles etc.


Hopefully a sign of things to come. Would love an Apple TV app as well.


They need to do jazz next!


This is the real reason. It's unlikely to be a strategy or conspiracy.


While Android might have more total users worldwide, I doubt there are more Android users that subscribe to Apple Music than Apple users.


Second reason is the real reason.

Google has always been a web app company.

They don't mind when you use their hardware but ultimately what matters is for their apps to be everywhere.


It's the opposite of Apple who mostly pretend like the outside world doesn't exist.


Huh? What Google app has crossfade on iOS?


There are a lot of elderly people who have an iPad but no smartphone, and they’re a prime group for AMC.

Young children also often have iPads with no smartphones, but they’re probably not listening to much classical music.


Same. I wish I had known the links wouldn’t work before I added them all 😢


Ah, so they don’t want you messing around with ‘discovery’ while operating a vehicle. That makes more sense.


My point exactly: this is a *first-party* app in a qualifying category.

Most third party apps don’t bother applying for CP because it takes extra work to make it compliant (adding voice control, a view with auto layout and minimum distractions and above all, a sensible use case *while driving*).


I don’t see what this fixes that simply adding a composer or writer column doesn’t. 

You know what it does? Creates another app to monetize.


Careful, redditors love drama like that.


[deleted]


I’m sure they have actual data versus your assumptions on why this was prioritized.


Sure, but iPhone was where they released first. When looking at where to focus your development efforts next, you can choose between getting the app to iPad users (many of whom likely already own an iPhone) or Android users (many of whom likely don't have any other Apple devices). So by prioritizing Android, they're hitting a larger untapped market.


It’s only Mac and iPad users, it’s already on iPhone


there are likely more android users who will use classical than Mac or iPad users.


Playing devils advocate here to say that it’s not very far fetched to guess that Apple Music might have higher usage on iOS and Android than tvOS and macOS and even iPadOS. For me personally, I seldom use Apple Music on my Mac or iPad compared to my phone. Plus the app on Mac is dogshit lol so if there’s a new feature I’d rather hope it hits iOS before Mac or iPad


Probably more Android Apple Music subscribers than Mac/iPad apple music subscribers


I'm that user only because Google discontinued Google Play Music. Google Play Music was great because I could upload my iTunes library. When Apple Music launched for Android, I signed up only because I could upload my iTunes library.


I'd guess there are more apple music users on android than apple music users who primarily listen on mac or ipad.


This headline is kind of silly. It came to iOS before android, the only "story" here is that music streaming apps are most popular on phones, which shouldn't really come as a surprise to anyone.


Now factor in family plans where some family members have Android


[deleted]


Apple Music Classical does have a more fiddly interface than regular Apple Music, but I’d guess it’s less about what they *want* people to do, and simply that they know that people using CarPlay for their music are either playing their own music or verbally asking for a simple playlist or station. I think all the playlists in Apple Music Classical also exist in Apple Music, and I know that anything you add to your library via the Classical app gets added to your regular library.


Alright well you asked for a reason and were offered one. No mention of monetizing anything was even brought up but run with the pitchfork and torches theme if it makes you happy.


Are you sure you've used Windows in the last like three years? It was bad before and now it's just way worse. It's hot shit right now. They keep releasing features and pulling them back or they release unfinished software for people to beta test, Windows 11 being the best example of that.


Damn...


 More likely it's due to internal beuracracy. Probably Android team was able to ship before the iOS team. I can totally imagine that the teams are separate enough that there's no one above them who would ensure they release one before the other as a policy.


Tell me you’re a product owner or PM with out telling me

Edit: OP has PM aim their user name. Conspiracy confirmed

If companies had data to base their decisions on, then why do companies end up making bad decisions hm?


[deleted]


More than that, I’m just confused why they roll out all these methods for developing apps that work across iPhone iPad and Mac, and even having switched the macOS runtime to the same ARM runtime as their mobile devices… yet they didn’t just make a cross platform app to work on all various screen sizes. I 100% understand prioritizing apps based on user base, I just don’t see why iPhone iPad and Mac weren’t all developed as a single unit


I’m sure they do but you’re also assuming what that data says, I’d still be shocked to hear more android users subscribe to Apple Music than apple users. I think it’s just as likely that they released it to a smaller user base to ensure the service works without issue before releasing it to their larger base


99% chance that the android team is completely separate from the iOS/iPad/mac team, so there's no prioritization going on, it's just that the android team finished first.


They can also test out features and have bugs fixed before releasing it to their bigger main user base.


It's not far fetched, I think you're spot on. It's my understanding that subscriptions are apples latest bread and butter. Say I have a family subscription to Apple One and an iPhone, but my wife really likes her Samsung, we can still use our Apple Music family plan. This way you can still justify buying a family plan even in a household of mixed devices.


Than mac/ipad subscribers that don’t also have a iphone specifically.

The vast majority of their subscribers already have a device that can use it.  Android is probably a much larger market than people who subscribe but only have non-iPhone apple devices.


Oh certainly, Android users as a group are huge. I just didn’t want to ignore the group of iPad users either.


Is nobody allowed to disagree with you or just me?

If you can’t see that writing on the wall or handle disagreement maybe don’t comment next time.


Exactly, it’s very obviously due to two different teams. 

How do most redditors seem to have absolutely bugger all critical thinking skills?


Android has so many different platform variations they need to build with compared to iOS. Makes sense iOS is quicker to develop


Gee, I wonder why apple wouldn’t want to tap into a large user base for a product that is under-penetrated in the market. 

Even if it doesn’t pan out, that would be a dumb business move to prioritize a tertiary platform where they wouldn’t gain any extra revenue (it’s included with am, and if you have an iPad, you most likely already have an iPhone). Use your critical thinking skills.


Data does not necessarily mean you make good decisions.


That information is a bit out of date; iOS has included a FLAC decoder [since iOS 11](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/06/09/ios-11-brings-lossless-flac-audio-to-iphone-and-ipad/).


That's how android does it

Explains a *lot* about the world.


>	It’s very obvious

There could be oceans of different reasons why the Android version released before but to you it’s *very obvious* what that reason is

Goodness gracious…

Most of the time people complaining about other peoples thinking skills aren’t, in my experience, the brightest. You might be right but you’re clueless as well.


I mean, not really. This only really affects testing and all that can be automated anyway. And dev time far outstrips testing time, so if this particular team of android devs are far faster than their iOS counterparts, it's easy to see reasons why the android version could be ready ahead of iOS. Lots of factors at play.


Sure, but it doesn't mean the Android team can't release faster.


Yeah true, but it's not exactly priorization as in "we need to release Android before iPad" which is what some of those comments were saying.


>	Most of the time people complaining about other peoples thinking skills aren’t, in my experience, the brightest.

Funnily enough you’re describing yourself too.

I forgot redditors love to be pedantic. I shall clarify I meant “it is *most likely* the case that it’s two separate teams with different schedules etc”.

I think it’s obvious because I’m a software developer that works in one of these teams that is running parallel to another team working on the same app for another platform.


the weather app is soooo much better thank god


Reminder you can use Apple Passwords as an 2FA Authenticator now!

Reminder you can turn on Allow more data in 5G to download updates over 5G (iOS 15)


I just realized I've been assuming macOS Monterey is also released today, but nobody is actually talking about that.

It was the one I was most excited about. I take it it's only coming later this year? :(


I’m excited for Focus modes so I can keep my work apps separate from everything else.


I've had quite a few PMs asking about Apollo, so just wanted to say a juicy update will be out in a few hours! I'm really happy with it, features one of the most commonly requested features: [auto-opening Reddit URLs in Apollo](https://i.imgur.com/rqDMwa5.gifv). Plus a bunch of other goodies, of course, gotta have the latest and greatest from day 1.

Hope mods don't mind (I can remove if so just PM me), but I wanted to mention another app I released today too called Amplosion that a lot of people here requested for Apollo. **A way to annihilate AMP pages from the web**. It was hard to integrate into Apollo with just the URL to go off of, but the Safari extension is exceptional. 

Amplosion: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1585734696

It also includes a Tamagotchi-style pixel dog that lives in the Settings screen named Lord Waffles.


Why is it that the download iOS15 button is "hidden" near the bottom of the update page under where it says your device is up to date along with iOS 14.8 version number?

I feel like this (early) round of update is trying to make iOS15 more like an opt-in rather than shoved down your throat. Perhaps they're trying to tease out major launch issues before telling everyone to upgrade?

**Edit**: Screenshots to explain what I mean. The [update to iOS 15 button is actually hidden from default view](https://i.imgur.com/rmQLe27.png) on my 12 Pro Max. You have to [scroll down further to see it or dismiss that banner about iOS15](https://i.imgur.com/SWGheEe.png)


T-Mobile had a carrier update! Go to settings general about and that should trigger it.


Wow, mine downloaded in less than 60 seconds.  I think that's a personal best for me since the original iPhone.


Anyone else getting a warning in settings that “iPhone storage almost full”?  This is despite my iPhone storage having only 36 of 64 Gb used.


I really like the safari search bar at the bottom!! Now I don’t drop my phone every time I try to search something with just one hand available.

First impressions on the iPad are fairly negative. Lots of small visual glitches, Safari is a distinct downgrade, rearranging apps on the home screen is very glitchy, and in general the home screen looks worse and is less functional IMO. That said, split screen improvements are great - it's finally practical to use it with apps that aren't in the dock.

The Lock Screen comes up fine, but after I unlock it, the screen goes black and a rotating loading icon appears for about two seconds, then the Lock Screen flashes again, then back to that loading icon, alternating for about 3 minutes before the iPad restarts itself and then the Lock Screen comes back up. Anyone else having this issue, or know how to solve it? I’m hoping I won’t have to connect to a computer to revert the OS, but I probably will have to.

Edit: I was able to put the iPad into recovery mode, so I “updated” to 14.8. Guess I’m waiting for 15.1 :/


Why the fuck can’t you horizontally swipe open the notifications anymore? Why do they just simply take away features willy nilly?


Everything updated nice and quickly except for HomePod Mini which is still refusing to play nice with my mesh network, and won’t do the tether trick properly.

Side note: you can get Safari 15 for MacOS already, even though Monterey isn’t out yet.

Initial impressions as someone who wasn’t in the beta:

-	Everything feels slick.
-	Loss of the fixed column of widgets on the iPadOS Home Screen is infuriating. Widgets now take up space meant for icons, and make the home screen messy. Not a fan. In fact the removal has made me oddly angry, especially as what they’ve replaced it with feels like something that have could have existed alongside it, rather than replacing it, so I’m not feeling particularly generous towards the rest of the update.
-	A few visual bugs in iOS (text overflowing things etc.), nothing major.
-	TVOS, nothing major to report. Generally I guess you’d never know if you’ve updated or not, the UI is identical.
-	It’s going to take a long time to get used to the address bar in iOS Safari, and it pops up way too eagerly when scrolling to the top of the page, meaning your attention gets pulled away. Change for change sake. At least I found the control to turn it off rather than hurl my phone at the wall. The worst bit is typing in a search term but your attention getting pulled away to the top of the screen where the results are, causing mistypes. How this got past QA or even the design stage is completely beyond me. 
-	MacOS Safari feels like an inbetween phase of design with regards to tabs, something feels off. I’ve tried the different settings available, can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing something.
-	Not really noticing anything different about the Photos App other than they’ve somehow made the title text on the memories look both squashed *and* stretched and really amateurish.
-	FaceTime improvements are nice, especially to the interface before starting the call. It was rubbish before.
-	Focus is alright, if not as configurable as I hoped from the way they went on about it at WWDC.
-	iPad homescreen again - sorry, I hate having widgets amongst my icons, but I want them on my homescreen the way they were before. Also, not sure why there is now a toggle between “normal” and “large” icons when to my eye it looks like they were somewhere inbetween before?
-	Tab groups in Safari, nice!
-	Weather app, nice!
-	Home app… still nicer than the competition, but still pretty awful.
-	Be interesting to see how CarPlay looks and feels when I commute tomorrow.
-	New Lock Screen notifications seem a mixed bag - some are nice, others group weirdly, some seem to have a lot of wasted space. I suppose it depends on the app.
-	The App Library is *still* uncustomisable meaning several apps are in quite frankly dumb places.
-	Notes app and Reminders app feel more useful, nice.
-	The upgrade of my Apple One sub to iCloud Plus was nice to see.
-	The News app feels virtually untouched - shame, it’s one I use an awful lot.
-	The new maps are *gorgeous* and the UI updates are *chef’s kiss*.
-	Calendar still feels like it should be better despite the fact it’s pretty good already and has some nice functionality.

Overall, it feels a bit *meh*. Some nice stuff, some under the hood stuff, some frankly irritating stuff. It amazes me how far we’ve come since the days of the original iPhone (my first was the 3GS), but also how Apple seems to shaft itself every other release.

Something about iOS 15 at the moment feels half baked, it’s a fit and finish thing. I obviously haven’t had as much time with as beta testers have, but first impressions have not been particular exciting, and in some cases, not good.


I can’t even ask Siri to play a playlist or ask the current time while offline? What the fuck was the point of on device processing then?

Edit: I have an 11 Pro, which is a supported device for offline Siri. This isn’t a glitch or unsupported hardware or anything, offline Siri genuinely can’t even start playing downloaded music, lmao. I’m in awe.


Pleaaaaaaase tell me they are going to fix the iMessage previews where you could slide down from a notification and send a message. Now you have to click on the notification to close the app you’re using and switch to messages. Huge step backward.

EDIT: tap and hold on the notification in the drop down, or swipe down on the banner 🤦‍♂️


Epic. 

Digital marketing people are going hate life more thanks to the privacy improvements.


I’ve learned my lesson (after about 7 releases) and I’m not updating until 15.1 comes out


Heads-up — iPadOS 15 totally wrecked my Home Screen on my iPad (mini 5).  I had just two screens with apps & folders, now I have 13 screens and apps & folders are spread out across all thirteen.  It even changed the apps pinned in my dock.


I just installed it and my search functionality has stopped working.  Is this a bug or a feature of ios15?  I usually just search for an app on my phone and then open it from their.


How come Apple doesn’t let us download updates via data? I don’t care because I have a WiFi connection, but why?


It’s gonna take like 4-5hours for everyone to be able to install it right?


Does everything looks smaller on iOS 15 or is it just me?


How’s the iPhone X handling the update?


My AirPods no longer switch between modes on long presses. I’ll troubleshoot more.


God I feel like such a boomer for asking this but how in the hell can I push this to update? My phone is saying that it's "up to date" when its on 14.7 .....I tried manually doing it on my MacBook and it's saying the same thing there...


Please don’t forget to pay $10 for the upgrade on the App Store! 

(Can you imagine a world like that, or if it stayed like that from the past)


What happened to swipe right to open notifications :( feels so weird to tap them open now… I know I’ll get used to it eventually but it just feels super off rn

I’m still on iOS 14.7 what the heck

My alarms still don’t play the songs i selected from apple music… they’re silent!!


Slide over isn’t working well on my iPad Pro. I like to have messages over there to quickly slide in when I want to text someone. It seems to be constantly crashing/closing if I don’t slide it over for a little while, and I have to manually pull up the little dock thing and drag a new slide over window over there. Incredibly annoying.


Does anyone else have a stuck location arrow on the upper left corner? It's the unfilled white one but it doesn't go away unless I turn off Find My iPhone (which I'm definitely not doing)

Edit: To clarify, I have Status Bar Icon turned on but on iOS14 the arrow would only appear when location was being used. Now it's stuck displaying even when it's not unless I turn the Status bar Icon off. Mildly annoying. :/

I know they dropped SharePlay, but did they also drop the screen sharing feature in FaceTime? I don’t remember hearing about that but I couldn’t get it to work.


This is more of a nitpick, but the option to keep my phone from dimming is gone. In settings, under the “Display & Brightness” section there used to be a way to keep your phone from auto-locking. Now, the option is gone and the longest time to keep the phone from dimming is 5 minutes. I know they probably got rid of the “forever” option for security purposes, but I was used to my phone never dimming lol.

Edit: Does this even make sense?


Just realized they added 1.25x speed on Apple Podcasts app...thank you Apple!! 1.5x was just too much for me, 1.2x is perfect, 1.25 is a great compromise to finally have available:)


so far, iOS 15 runs better on my 6s than 14. How weird.

Anyone else having issues with Mail Privacy Protection? I enabled Hide My IP Address and disabled Block All Remote Content, yet all my emails have a message at the top saying “Unable to load remote content privately”…. What am I missing? Would having Adguard DNS affect this?!

Edit: I disabled the adguard profile and still have the issue.


Reported two bugs so far! Mail Privacy Protection doesn’t work properly and certain City Guides in Maps either won’t open or crash the app if they do!


I cant get used to the address bar moving down, but I get why they did it. That where your thumbs/fingers type most of the time.


Might just be me but does anyone else’s phone feel quicker or smoother? I’ve got iPhone 12 Pro Max


Not available via Finder yet…


Is it just me or does the iPad have *too* many gestures now? Starting to feel a bit clunky.


Is anyone seeing the new AirPods Pro firmware roll out yet? I’m missing the new ANC modes.


Somebody please tell me you can return to the previous way of seeing your tabs (not in the bar, but when you click +)

The default wallpapers in iOS 15 are so bad. Where are some new ones?


With safari extensions you can now have honey as an extension for coupons!


Couple of bugs here and there, alright on SE 2020.


Haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else yet, but I love the new feature they added to Photos where you can just pull up the EXIF info instead of using a 3rd party app or a computer.


Roughly 15+ gb of free storage space and it’s saying my iPhone is almost full.


Be forewarned that majority of comments are gonna be a result of negative experiences, as those with more positive experiences are less likely to speak their mind. With that said here are things I've spotted.

\- Find My Siri functionality has regressed. When I ask for my keys or wallet etc, it doesn't recognise them anymore. Got to play a sound via the app (annoying)

\- Widgets on iPad are extremely unstable. Ignoring the erratic behaviour of moving widgets around (Cause it has to compensate for both vertical and horizontal orientations), the homescreen crashes frequently even with apples widgets. So I'm very discouraged from using them for now.

\- I do like the tab group feature as someone with multiple devices and 100s of tabs open. I'm not sure about the new browser experience on phone yet.

\- Apple has STILL not fixed the cursor hover bug on iPad on the Lock Screen. I'm not sure how they haven't noticed it yet. At least it's a visual bug and not a functional one.

\- Spatial audio is a nice (and optional) feature that works even with the browser.

\- I'm so far loving the extra detail of Maps, it's FAR more readable than before and doesn't feel like a Jackson pollock painting like before the update.


So far no update from IOS 15 RC. Hopefully we get a new build number.

If you delete the profile you will get the new build. 

But usually apple does not give developers the update with the profile most likely cuz we getting 15.1 or similar soon.


Hate that you can't swipe right anymore on notifications to jump right into the message


Why does no one care, year after year, release after release, that iOS Photos is just this side of unusable? I mean, the larger your photo collection is and the more albums and folders you make, the worse it gets, and yet nobody ever even mentions it.


iOS 15 installed on iPhone 11 Pro (was on latest): no problem

iPadOS 15 installed on M1 iPadPro (was on latest): no problem

Looks like iPadOS has fixed my Realforce keyboard problem!  For whatever reason, this keyboard would be seen as a Japanese one, and no setting change would force it be seen/used as a US one (layout is US).


God I hate the part where I have to wait until the phone decides the update is available.


I get a warning in settings saying my iPhone is almost full but I have 20 gigs free. Clicking the banner does nothing. Looks like a glitch. iPhone XS Max. 
https://i.imgur.com/zV3TUgT.jpg


I have barely looked at the Ipad, but I updated it and didn't like what it did with my home screen.  Evidently it put widgets at the top and pushed all my apps downward.  Why would they put all the widgets at the top when originally they were off screen and you brought them in by swiping from left to right.  I do like the addition of the App library on the dock though.  

The other OS I have is TVOS and that pretty much hasn't changed.  It really is about time Apple looked at TV OS and gave it a facelift.  Heck, make the app icons smaller so you can put more on the top shelf or something.  I feel like TV OS and Apple Music are the two neglected things Apple has right now.


i have no idea how to use hide my email and private relay. anyone got it work and care to explain what it does and how to use it?

Anyone else getting the oled flashing green issue again that was fixed in ios 14?

iPhone 12 pro max


Can’t see my three airtags! Just says ”add airtag” as if I didn’t have any. And I can’t add the one on my keys since it’s already paired. 

Does anyone know a fix? 

iPhone 11 Pro

Edit: Restarting my IPhone twice fixed it!


Okay I just updated and the feature I was most excited about is the Focus modes but I missed a glaring detail about it... apparently you can only *whitelist* people & apps? I was expecting you could blacklist... blacklisting seemed a lot more obvious to me & now I'm just a bit disappointed.


Anyone know how to turn off the 3 dots that appear at the top of apps in iPadOS 15? They are meant for multitasking but are very distracting when I am reading a book in dark mode.


They moved the "back" and "forward" buttons in Safari to accommodate a menu button.  It seems really stupid.


My XR is lagging here and there. Not cool.


Barely notice any changes on an iPhone X. On an iPad Pro, Jesus, what a mess. Widgets on the sidebar, widgets on the springboard, icons knocked all over the place, dock stuffed with App Library and auto hiding, space usage terrible. My first introduction to it was wondering where these widgets came from, deleting them as I couldn’t move them to the left hand widget strip (WHICH I USED!!!) as it had been turned into three new widget areas, none of which I could move items between, then shuffling icons back where they were, and wondering why the icon counts had changed. What a crappy introduction to iPadOS 15.


All these years and still can’t choose a custom snooze time


11 pro feels very fast on iOS 15


Trying to update my iPhone XS and I keep getting this error: "Unable to Install Update. An error occurred installing iOS15". Any idea how to fix this? I've hit "retry" about four times now.


Is the podcast app still garbage?


Google Authenticator seems to have double up all accounts in the screen, fyi.


I want to be careful because I read a bit about a few bugs in the RC version of iOS 15. 

Can anyone report broken apps on iOS5 or annoying bugs?

Edit: iOS 15


Something fun about this update for Vietnamese users like myself: Apple has split the default Vietnamese keyboard into 2, Telex and VNI!

I’ve been using VNI for a few years now on Windows since it prevents Telex shenanigans with the “foreign” letters (F, J, W, Z, which are not used by the language), but iOS didn’t have it up until now (either 15 or 14.8, but probably the former since the latter was only a security patch). The new keyboard will take some time to get used to since each key is smaller to accomodate the row of numbers (and switching to symbols brings the bigger keys back), but I’ll enjoy the heck out of it!


Is there a way to put the address bar back at the top in safari or is it on the bottom for good?


Its [arrived](https://i.imgur.com/piPH2EZ.jpg)


Is there any way to remove or move further down the "Air Quality" and "Air Quality Map" sections in the Weather app? I really don't care about this and would much prefer to quickly see hourly forecast and 10-day forecast at the top instead.


Enjoying the new update :)


I'll give it a few days but so far its ugly and I hate it.


Almost everything is a little bit slower for me on my iPhone 11 Pro. You can see when things are loading up.

One more noticeable annoying thing is when I take a screenshot and want to send it away etc. It comes up a pop up that says “Preparing” and doesn’t happen anything in several minutes. 

https://i.imgur.com/K540irV.jpg


8 plus took 15 minutes to prepare and download. Feels choppy so far. Although wont have to worry since 13 pro is coming in this friday for me.


it's not showing up for me, just saying that my version is up to date but I'm running 14.7 does anyone else have this problem


every year it takes a bit to roll out to be people and every year these threads get packed full of people asking where it is seconds after it launches. good lord just check periodically throughout the day, it’s not a big deal.


Got an update on RC


Oof the weather radar is having issues loading everything. Hope they fix it.


Fellow iPad users, remember how we used to have the date/time at the top of the widget column on the first page of apps? Is there any way to bring that date/time back or is it gone?


please tell me they fixed the app icon spacing on ipad OS 15 XP

and even some of the little things


A small bug i noticed is when trying to change the date of multiple photos, if you do it twice, it starts moving them back by the original amount, rather than the new date you set.  So if you change 10 photos that were taken today to the same day last year, and then try to do it again, it'll change them to 2 years ago, then 3, etc.


How much free space does this require? My 64 GB iPhone prompted me to temporarily offload apps during the install and it has 15GB free. My 32 GB iPad Pro also prompted me to temporarily offload apps and then it just throws an error and refuses to install the update at all


What's been the biggest improvement or feature you have enjoyed?


Any bugs or breakage on the release build that anybody is noticing? Haven’t updated yet but might wait for a 15.1 release if it’s buggy.


The absolute best, top tier improvement is how you manage a widget stack and add new items. 

My god I do not understand how that first iteration came out and they couldn’t see how clunky and terrible it was to just add a widget to a stack without having to correct positioning of every home item afterwards


I keep getting an "unable to install update" error after downloading and attempting to install the update; anyone else? I've tried hard resetting the phone and re-downloading the update to no avail


Does anybody else experience a situation where one device takes ages to download the update while the other does it within minutes?  


My iphone 12 pro has been downloading for a solid hour and still displays 3 hours remaining, while my ipad downloaded it in a minute flat.


So am I to understand that Live Text is unavailable for Denmark? The option just isn't there in settings.


**when spyos?**


Finally a decent weather app.


My relative installed iOS 15 and now almost all of his photos are gone. ~2k photos gone and only 4 random ones remain. Some have gone to recently deleted. His iCloud photos are off. We’ve tried rebooting to no avail. 

Is this a bug? Any hope of getting those photos back?


You go to sites to figure out how exactly to work Focus and they are literally contradicting one another because it is so confusing. If I select "Share my Focus Status" why do I need to go into every single contact and select to share my focus status again? And half of them it just turns itself back off once as I go back into it. Focus is a neat little concept but my god it is the opposite of user-friendly.

Did anyone else's iPhone lose all of their Airtag information after the iOS15 update? 


My airtags all disappeared on my iPhone 12 pro max after the update. 


Now I don't know how to get my phone to re-recognize them. 

Really weird.


**EDIT:  Found the Solution**

After an hour long call with Apple Support we finally figured it out. It's a known glitch thats affecting a few people. 

https://twitter.com/RDSYES/status/1440096981460738050


Turn off bluetooth. Remove the battery from a nearby AirTag. Wait for 10 seconds. Put battery in and listen for chirp. Then pull it out and and put it back in again and listen for a chirp. Do this 5 times in a row and on the last time you should hear a different sounding chirp. You should then be prompted to register a new AirTag. As soon as you do so, all of your other Airtags will instantly show up again in the FindMy App. 

Super weird glitch but this worked for me.


iOS 15 is running super slow on my iPhone 8 :(

Edit: Things have improved after about 10 minutes or so.


Battery drain bug incoming


I got the update. Started downloading. I am from India

iPhone SE 2020 - 2.86 GB


What I was concerned the most is Safari changes. As that’s the one I use the most daily. Some muscle memory to relearn here.  
The search bar at the bottom seems bizarre to me, but at least that’s an option. Tab Groups seem like overkill to use on a phone, and the new UI isn’t comfortable on my fingers.  
I wish the Start Page could be disabled entirely. The closest is removing everything, and awkwardly just leaving the Edit button.  
And then my URL search suggestions disappeared. Seems like Siri suggestions has to be left on for that. ~~Good that the full URL is back though, it was odd and uncomfortable when that became truncated.~~ Edit: Only for Siri suggestions. Suggestions for history still doesn’t show the full URL. Why?    
  
This one’s a nitpick, but it’s strange that the Start Page background starts as a blank page. Then if you pick anything, you can’t go back to that except for turning it off. Seems like “blank white page” should be an option too.  
  
Edit: Another thing. Seems too easy to scroll to the top and trigger the page refresh that I didn’t want to. I now have to be conscious of stopping myself.  
That seems redundant as well when I could just touch the refresh button specifically when I want to.
  
Edit: I’m often getting an issue that zooming in/out won’t register, ~~but I can still scroll~~. It goes away if I keep trying, but not sure if there’s a pattern or it’s a random bug.


I fucking hate this iPad homescreen so much. It looked so elegant in 14 and it looks like fucking horseshit now.

Like why is this so fucking hard for you Apple. Grid the fucking pages and let me put whatever I want wherever I want without nonsensical limitations. It’s really not that hard. Android solved this problem 30 years ago.


Does anyone know why we can’t add ID’s in Wallet yet? Or FaceTime people who don’t have iPhones? Am I just missing something?


So far i'm not really liking the update.


Anyone able to get iTunes to give them iOS 15?


I love copying text on my photos and pasting text from real life immediately with my camera!!


Still have 14.7 on ipad pro 2020. Update isn't showing up for me at all. Rebooted ipad, charged to 100%, no update.


I updated both my iPad Air 3 and iPhone XR really quick, the download was really fast, the preparing time was slower. I mostly did it because I like to keep my stuff updated, even if the new features are mostly meh to me. Live Text on Photos, and iPhone apps on iPad in horizontal (still waiting for that damn Instagram update) are my favorite features by now. Kind of excited because there has been a lot of noise in regards to Apple Pay launch in my country and now Settings has the Wallet menu. I like the new aesthetics, very similar yet fresh, and performance so far has been just as good as the previous version so my iPhone XR feels fresh again.

Now I’m waiting for the Watch SE to update, it’s been really slow, and I want the new Portrait Face!


Has anyone had any luck with extensions in Safari? All of mine are greyed out in settings and in Safari and I can’t enable them. I have tried restarting multiple times.


Can someone answer a question pls - if I turn off 'time sensitive' for notifications for Reminders, reminders that have a specific time, will that mean they won't appear at that time OR will appear at the time. I'm frankly, very very confused.


https://i.imgur.com/1LnVd71.jpg Still nothing for my phone lmao 

I got the new iPadOS though. So far so good, but podcast app keeps crashing


My phone has been running hot and battery draining like crazy since I updated. I even turned it off for 30 min to let it fully cool down and it just heated right back up…


Can you connect Yale smart lock to Apple wallet?


I'm not able to update :( its showing that is up to date "14.7" i have the 11


Can’t seem to get the update on my iPad Pro. Worked fine on my iPhone. Not showing up on my iPad.


Notify when Left behind is greyed out for apple watch 6, AirPods Pro, MacBook Pro etc... Anyone else?


My favourite new thing is tapping on an alarm to change it (which I always forgot *didn’t* do anything) instead of Edit.


Has anyone else been getting an error message when trying to install the update? I have an iPhone XS and I have tried to download/install it at least ten times. I have cleared downloaded it, turned my phone off and turned it back on, installed it, cleared my network settings, done pretty much everything Google has told me to do. I keep getting an error message. It's very frustrating and odd since my iPad Air downloaded it immediately but my iPhone XS keeps getting an error message.


Has anyone found a way to PIN the Today View back to the home page? This is literally the WORST. Please take me back to iOS14


Have they said anything about removing the app name from under widgets in iOS? I'm glad they did it on the iPad, but I'd like them to do  it on phones too.


I really like the new weather app. That new wallpaper is terrible though, looks like something you can make on procreate in 5 minutes


How is the battery life so far ? Better, same or worse than 14.6 ?


Has this happen to anyone else?

I had my iPhone 12 plugged in for almost 2 hours but there was no charge.  I plugged in at 63% and noticed my battery depleted to 55%.

After replugging everything was fine though.


The only feature I was eagerly waiting for is iCloud Private Relay and it's fucking not available in Russia. FFS APPLE.


Anyone know the reason that this is the first time Apple is leaving up iOS 14 *and* 15? 

I have a hunch it’s due to poor performance of 15 on older phones. I use an iPhone 7, so I worry I might regret updating to 15.


Baterry has been pretty bad today on 12 pro max


All my air tags are no longer in find my can’t add them back either


>move the safari address bar to the bottom for ease of access

>move the tab previews to the top to make it harder to close or select tabs

What was Apple thinking. 

Safari is just a mess in general. I did find some shortcuts that make things a little better - shame I had to discover them myself from experimentation. 

>Long press on the tab view button (bottom right icon) to bring up a menu - I find creating a private tab easier from here than the ‘default’ way

>if you enter the private tab group and just hit ‘done’ (might be different in English) in the bottom right, a new tab is created automatically

>you can also close tabs from the menu hidden in the tab view button which is still inconvenient but slightly better than the ordinary way

Edit: bonus tip: if you have a XS or iPhone with 3d touch, you can hard press the tab view button to bring up the hidden menu instantly


Anyone experience airdrop issues? Instead of seeing my wifes contact on airdrop, I see a contact with no name and no photo and I can’t airdrop her. She can airdrop me however. 

I updated my phone to ios 15 and started experiencing this. She is still on ios 14.8 and sees my phone fine.


It seems all my airtags were magically removed from my icloud account. Find my states that i have no airtags when in fact i have 3.

Anyone else experienced this issue?


Seems like everyone is having a bad experience?


CarPlay maps looks much worse, but I’m loving the approach they are taking personally


The widget placement system is a mess / broken / ugly on the iPad. This “update” is an embarrassment.


Not a fan of Safari. I usually juggle with a bunch of websites and not to have a clear visual representation of open tabs is a massive downgrade.

E: I tried to look in settings but so far no joy.


…and the crowd goes *MILD*!


I’m 99% sure this is a UI bug in safari. When the address bar collapse it changes color to white despite I have dark mode on. And WTF is that white bar at the top??? However, websites supporting dark mode don’t have this issue.

Why is it that I can’t respond to texts in the notification anymore?  It’s like they took the worst part of Big Sur and said “everyone hates that, let’s put it iOS too!”


Every time I click the map it shows me the temperature instead of precipitation…it doesn’t remember my choice after I change it.


>the weather app is soooo much better thank god

And still no iPad app. With the remaking of the app with new technologies it should not be hard to make it scalable to an iPad.

wtf the iphone 8/x doesn't get the new weather app animations according to the changelog linked here lmaoo, fuck apple i'm getting a flip phone


The built-in 2FA is huge, imo. No more needing to jump over to Authy to get the code and jump back, it just auto-fills it for you.


Wait really? How exactly do you do that though?


It really blows my mind that apple is clearly trying to improve the iOS passwords existence, but they seem to completely ignore what is nice about the competition’s offerings. 

It’s just so clunky to interact with when doing anything aside from using it under ideal circumstances. 

I’m so ready to never give 1password anymore money. I thought all I needed was 2fa to make the switch, but iOS passwords still just needs a little bit more polish before I can be confident.


2FA in Apple Passwords is my favorite feature of iOS 15!


I don’t think they have announced a date. But Big Sur came out later in the fall last year so it’s a safe bet they will follow suit this year. Maybe we will hear more at the next event rumored to launch new MacBooks.


At least Safari 15 for Mac has been released for Bug Sur.


FYI macOS almost always comes in October, about a month after iOS and iPadOS.


if they're also planning to announce some new macs by the end of the year, I wouldn't doubt they release Monterey the day the event happens.


Maybe it’ll get released at around the same time as the M1X MacBook Pros (or whatever they’re gonna call them).

The concept is great but the execution seems lacking, at least for the scenario you described. 

The only way to get that to really work is to have a personal focus mode that is on whenever you’re not working - easy enough, the system supports that well. But you can’t define a focus mode as a block list right now - only an allow list. Ideally a personal focus mode would be “everything and everyone can send notifications except X Y and Z”. Instead, you have to manually list out every app that should be allowed to notify you, and every person who should be allowed to contact you. There’s not even an option to say “all apps” just to at least take advantage of the different home page screens. 

Until they add block lists for apps (and ideally people too), I don’t see myself actually using the feature at all unfortunately.


Yes I think this is the most important feature.


I have a very specific question. Maybe someone who had the beta can help me out.

My Homescreen is my 16 standard apps and then a Siri-Suggestions Widget underneath. I use spotlight to open other apps.

If you long press on an app in the Siri Widget, you can ask not to show that app in the suggestions.

My question: Can I disable different apps on different Homescreens in Focus mode?
Basically when I’m at work I want the exact same layout as my standard layout, but with different suggestions (no Games etc. at work).

Does anyone know if that's possible?


wow its so cool that you're friends with Ryan Reynolds!!


Mind?! When I read about Amplosion I grinned ear to ear, immediately posted it in the mod Discord, and proceeded to install it 😂


Great Feature, often I'll Google something and when I open reddit in the browser it won't let me even see the post because the community is "app only"


I support anything you make. Getting Amplosion the second iOS 15 installs.


Honestly I’m considering buying amplosion just because you made it but…

What is amp and why do I hate it?

Edit: too late, I bought it. Still not sure what amp is but it needs to be stopped.


Congrats on the new app! That's huge. I can't wait to take care of my very own pixel dog that helps me fight the fight against AMP.


And it's open source?? bravo, especially like this little bit you added:  
"Unknown message, someone is being a sussy baka. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cmzCU5Z3Os](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cmzCU5Z3Os)"  


;)


Neat stuff, making the web better 💫  
One small thing: The sub title for *Beautiful Icons* is the same as for *Open Source* (https://i.imgur.com/EmwUrSg.jpg)


Speaking of Apollo… when will it be getting the iPadOS 14 sidebar and multi-column design?? Is that in the works at all???

Thank you so much for your hard work!! Ily


the speed at which I bought… unmatched


Does it also work in Firefox since under the hood, all the iOS browsers use WebKit?


When is a proper iPad app coming?


Just bought it. Amazing!! I hate AMP but I love you Christian


Does anybody know how the auto-opening of Reddit links works with Apollo? I’ve not looked into it in a while but I was sure you had to prove ownership of the domain before your app could register as a handler for the URL? 

Amazing feature either way, I’d been hoping for that for so long!


[removed]


Probably because Apple is now allowing people to stay on iOS14 and get security updates rather than forcing the update to iOS15. 

Which feels weird to me but I’m sure there are people who will welcome that change.


[deleted]


Likely to stop people from killing the servers by having everyone update in the same hour.


Is it 1.80.02?


Holy shit, [my T-Mobile 5g speeds](https://i.imgur.com/pzoA4Pj.jpg) are literally 10x faster than usual now.

Edit: oh they released 5g ultra capacity, I had heard they were going to but got the impression it was going to be an iPhone 13 only feature. This is great news for my 12 mini!


https://i.imgur.com/UreHgKp.jpg
I literally just got the carrier update prompt from T-Mobile as I was reading your comment


My downloaded fast but the preparing takes forever


Same here. Can't get the badge to clear on the settings app. Have around 15GB free.


Mine is saying it wants to delete apps and auto-reinstall them afterwards to make space for the update when I have enough space to download the update 10 times.

iPhone 11, 14.8 - 2.06.00


Huh interesting! My 11 Pro's modem firmware is at 3.00.00..


My 2020 SE is on 3.00


I wonder if that's the culprit behind the No Service bug people have been dealing with since 14.7.1 (maybe 14.7?), as it reverts to 14.6's firmware.


Mine says 3.0, Verizon


Split screen was almost unusable in the past, especially if you tried to use the feature that would have one app float on the right while the other app was full screen. That feature was downright unusable.


Yes but I have t installed 15 yet.


Got the same email, have yet to upgrade to iOS 15.


[deleted]


Yes I got it too. I think it’s just meant to highlight the new features (private relay, HomeKit video, etc) and to reduce confusion over the new iCloud+ branding which is essentially just the name for all paid iCloud tiers.


There is no more icloud paid tiers. All paid plans is icloud+.


What about battery? I heard apple installed bigger battery’s in iOS 15.


I’m glad safari is feeling less sad now lol


what Safari apps are you able to install ? Is there an adblock/noscript ?


Just tried it myself and you’re right. That seems like a massive oversight!


[deleted]


Same


Same here

UPDATE: I locked my iPad without unlocking it for 10-15 min and it seems like it’s working as normal now.


[removed]


What exactly is back?


Oh no I hate this


This was a terrible revert. Scrolling through two wheels to find your number is so much slower than just typing “1245”. 

Only reason some people wanted it back is because they hadn’t gotten over the learning curve due to years of experience with the older one. Once you built the muscle memory for it this was superior.


California or Canada lol


Yeah I thought it was getting delayed but it is a pleasant surprise.


Same thing happened to me. What iPad do you have ?


yep that pissed me off too. now you just click on them it seems


What do you mean horizontally swipe notifications?


So annoying, doing my head in


Came to this thread to find out if anyone else was noticing this or if mine was just bugged. It's driving me crazy!! My notifications also don't seem to be grouping anymore even though I've double checked and have it set to do that


Oh I just looked. Most of the new features don’t work on anything older than an iPhone X. So my iPhone 8+ is just the same as it was on iOS14. The only thing I’ve noticed is the safari search bar is on the bottom now ☹️


You need a iPhone with a A12 CPU or higher. “The ability to make Siri requests offline without an internet connection for timers, alarms, phone calls, messaging, sharing, launching apps, controlling audio playback, and opening settings. “


You can just hold the notification to open the preview


I can slide down to open the little quick reply menu just fine, it’s absolutely just a bug if you can’t. I’m imagine they’ll fix it soonish if it gets reported


Damn... I do digital marketing... OUCH  


But i mean--- most stuff has always/already gone back to just email /sms marketing anyways.   


Only thing hurt is FB Pixel for retargetting - but you can just disable sending adds to iOS and only target people on wifi... so all is not lost


I love when people stick their finger inside digital marketer’s asses.


That's pretty adventurous of you, I’ll be waiting for 15.2.3 and all of you beta testers to give me the green flag.


I tell myself that every year and yet here we are…


iPad Pro here, same issue. 

iOS15 decided to pick three random widgets and drop them on my Home Screen, then scramble all my other icons across multiple desktops. 

Interesting. 

Only took a few minutes to rearrange manually, but….yeah. 

I did not see the same on my iPhone 11 though.


Did it also take away the option for a more condensed home screen? I had everything set up on one page and now I can't fit it all


Based on my past experiences, Spotlight is usually reindexing everything after an OS upgrade so it may take a while before search is working again.


Same. As someone who made their home screens pretty scarce, I use the search function quite often.


Indexing I hope as this is how I work too


Maybe it needs time re-indexing?


Given the size of the updates, if it used cellular data, it could easily use up all of someone’s high speed for their cycle….. and as someone who works for a phone company, I get people who complain about their data enough as it is, so if cellular was an option, they’d complain even more about it


1 hour remaining for me


Mine says about 1 day remaining, up from when it started saying 16 hours.


I downloaded in 5 minutes


It made you larger.


Some apps feel narrower, like settings, Mail, and weather. Fonts in weather are bigger.


The notification bars being way thinner is definitely an odd change to adjust to.


I feel like the font is smaller or different somehow.


Everything feels a bit more smooth to me. But mine really needs a new battery and performance has not been great, so take this with a grain of salt.


Have you previously install any beta profiles on your devices?
If so remove it and the update should appear.


Apple was actually required to charge a fee in that case under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act


It was only the iPod Touch that required a purchase (and the Mac, to upgrade WiFi). The phone was always free. I’m not sure if they were just lying about SOX compliance or if they found a way around it or if they were just wrong. Weird times.


God I remember paying for Mac OS Snow Leopard


I just learned today that you can swipe right to open notifications lol. Trust me, tapping is so easy


is that a joke, or am I missing something


You can turn it off, but who at Apple thought changing someone’s already personalized widgets was a good idea?


Edit stack
Turn off widget suggestions


I tired my weather app too ‘always’ for location, it could be that?


The technology isn’t there yet.


The tab layout is weird at first but I do like how I can do more now with just my thumb and without having to change my grip (on iPhone 12 Pro)


You can change it back to top in safari settings.


It was at first but trust me after having it for a while on the betas and getting used to it it’s a lot easier to use,


Personally loving it. You can always change it to the normal version


I think shareplay gets implemented “later this fall”


For your auto dimming problem go to settings accessibility display and text size and at the bottom is the option to enable or disable auto brightness. And in display and brightness I am able to set my auto lock to never as well. So it doesn't dim


They probably need to have IOS 15 also. Have they updated?


Are they on iOS 15?


Same here, luckily you can move it back up in settings.


Yes and no. Feels smoother but have the feling they made the animations a tight bit slower in this os?


I think it's faster animations, at least going by my iPhone 11 Pro Max.


Maybe I don’t use my iPad enough but I just can’t remember all the gestures to do stuff quicker. 3 fingers here, 4 fingers there, 5 for something else. Not intuitive for me but again perhaps I don’t use it enough.


What new ones does it have?


Sure — Touch the “AA” icon on the address bar, then select “Show Top Address Bar”.


This has been my biggest gripe since starting with the public beta months ago. I can’t believe they made the notifications have to be swiped up then pull notification window down then dismiss the notification. It adds extra steps that were not needed.


Known bug.


I got an update from the RC. I deleted the Beta profile though.


I got a 400mb update from the RC


This is exactly why I gave up on the photos app a long while back and just use google photos exclusively now. The photos app is just a total mess to navigate and like you said in your comment, the more albums you have the bigger the nightmare is in trying to navigate through everything. It’s crazy how Apple talk about these massive features but they sometimes miss out on the smallest things that can be easily fixed.


Same on 12 pro max


That never went away for me


Oooh, thanks for making me notice I have the same issue.


I haven’t used those buttons since the iPhone 7. Just swipe the page back and forth.


My 11 as well


Seems like Apple regresses with each update when it comes to intuitiveness and discoverability. If I have to google how to do basic shit, you've failed the UX test.


12 mini feels faster!


Check it out! Let us know what you think


Yes! Click the “aA” button on the bar and then click “show top address bar”


In settings go to safari there’s a tab bar and single tab option. The single tab option moves the address bar to the top.


It’s in settings for safari


Settings, safari, tabs


Ugly? Maybe I missed something but isn't the design language like 95% identical to iOS 14? 

Unless maybe you thought 14 was ugly too.


After the update I needed to restart the phone one time before I got back my usual performance. After the restart no issue so far and everything is smooth as always


Ah yes a fellow swede


I’m keeping my 1st gen iPhone SE on iOS 14, mainly because it’s a massive pain in the ass to clear up enough storage to make the update work (I have a 16GB model). My 13 mini is coming on Friday, so I don’t see a point in trying to update this old piece of junk.


Same! This is just a warm up


By any chance is it at the bottom of your screen? I had to scroll down on the software update settings page to get to it.


Same here! Stuck at 14.7. I'm in Germany, maybe that's why.

EDIT: I just found out what the problem was! I had an iOS 14 beta/dev profile installed. Removed it, and now I have both 14.8 and 15 updates available!


I live how I wanna live


In light of Reddit's decision to limit my ability to create and view content as of July 1, 2023, I am electing to limit Reddit's ability to retain the content I have created.

My apologies to anyone who might have been looking for something useful I had posted in the past. Perhaps you can find your answer at a site that holds its creators in higher regard.


Don't use any apps while it's downloading.


Search bar at bottom was odd at first but makes way more sense, your finger is already down there on the keyboard


Exactly. I'd rather just have the option to go back to the IOS14 homescreen, with the dedicated widget column. When I looked through the settings for the option to change it back, it was nowhere to be found. The decision to not give us the option is mind boggling.


You should be able to FaceTime people who don't have iPhones, could do that months ago on the beta


>ID

I'm not seeing that in the change log so I'm afraid it will be "coming the fall" instead of "coming this fall with iOS 15 launch"


[deleted]


Make sure you don’t have 14 beta profile installed


Did you scroll down


Which iPhone?


Scroll down and there should be an option to “upgrade to iOS 15” and make sure you’re connected to wifi.


I was able to enable this for my AirTag (keys), but AirPods Pro, Apple Watch 4 it’s greyed out.


It’s fucking shit


Talk to your government, probably blocked at their request.


Enterprise and Education markets where they may not have had time to fully test the new iOS, or have an app/workflow that may not work with it yet. And/or they have users that they don’t want some app/gui changes to apply to just yet. Think about things like you have all your staff have iPhones and many of them are not technical. Then safari’s tab layout and address bar changes in an upgrade and they need to clock in/out and now your help desk is getting inundated with calls.

But they still want/need security updates.


iOS 15 isn’t a downgrade on performance and/or battery compared to iOS 14. 

If you’re worried about it, you can watch the many speed and battery test that have been released and so far, so good, which is surprising. You’ll see that scores are more or less the same and battery is within error margin in iOS 15.

Raw performance is the same, the difference is how how many bugs you will encounter with iOS 15 but that’s expected for a 15.0 release, the only issues I’ve had on my iPad 6th gen (has the same A10 as the iPhone 7) is some occasionally stutter when closing apps but overal day-to-day performance is better.

On the battery side of things, it should be around the same. Throughout the beta phases the battery was pretty solid all round, and it will take a few days to gauge.


Probably reindexing. Wait a few days.


Yes, I experienced the same thing. They showed up the next day.


It’s probably more the case that the dissatisfied ones are the most vocal.


12 Pro here, it’s quite nice.


No other than a few stutters here and there it's fine. After a restart it's completely fine

12 mini


There will be some selection/survivorship bias on this thread, as people are more likely to bother commenting if they're having a negative experience (aka, they wish to complain, understandably) than if they had a seamless and pleasant update.

There are probably hundreds of thousands of people who are fine with it 😅 

That said, there seem to be more bugs than usual for an official release. I can't even get past the welcome screen on my iPad!


That’s why I always wait. All these new operating systems are extremely complex and bound to have issue.


I love the new OSs personally. Very satisfied so far


I don’t know. The smart text stuff with the camera and photos is pretty awesome. I already used it today for a phone number.


It seems to default to precipitation when it’s actively raining/snowing. I added a few cities where it’s raining rn and it showed the precipitation map instead of temp.


Yeah I prefer to see precipitation first


This bothers me too.  I open the map to see the rain in the area, I really don’t care about seeing temperatures on a map.  Wish there was a way to default to the radar.


You can use a weather widget which just takes you to weather on safari. I wish there was a native app, they’re so close.


Apple still hasn’t innovated a weather app ideal for tablets, whatever that’s supposed to be


I never had Dark Sky, but from what I understand, yes. It now tells you when you can expect precipitation in your area (as well as when it will stop). There's also push notifications for it. There's also a ton of other new data and map overlays for temperature, precipitation, and air quality.


It’s mostly there. I was hoping to uninstall Dark Sky due to the planned obsolescence.  Dark Sky still has more detail about future weather. Why is it so hard to at least have a basic forecast for tomorrow? It says 80% of rain and that’s it. When? Morning? All day? The only option is to horizontally scroll on the hourly weather and look it at hour by hour which is tedious. 

The radar is nearly worthless in terms of detail. Dark Sky wasn’t great but it’s even worse in Apple Weather. RadarScope or bust if you want good detail.

Go to the bottom of this article to the section titled "Add Your Two-Factor Authentication Codes to Passwords" 

https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-start-guide/


The only thing that annoys me is that apple is building it into their ecosystem and a password manager is totally useless if it cant be used on multiple platforms.


They didn't really announce a date for iOS either, unless I missed it in the event. They just said the new devices will come with it installed.

You're right though, it will probably come with the new Macs later this year.

I was really really looking forward to playing with Shortcuts on my Mac today :(

Oh well, iPhone and iPad are installing 15 now, at least.


Yeah, saw an update and was very excited, thinking we may get Monterey!

Then I saw "Command line tools for XCode" in its description. I was most disappointed.

I see now I also get a fancy new Safari. Looking forward to playing with it!


Lol I do the same thing


[deleted]


Agreed, there isn’t even an ‘allow all’ toggle which would then let you go in and manually turn off the work ones, very disappointing


this, i tried setting up my personal focus mode and then realized i can only allow certain people/apps. what i really want is to be able to block work notifications/apps when i’m not at work. i originally had my work email notifications disabled to avoid being spammed all the time, and i wanted to only enable it during work focus mode. right now i have to enable the notifications all the time in order to allow them in work focus mode which kind of defeats the purpose.


Yeah I am pretty disappointed with this fact. I really just wanted to hide work notifications and the homepage with the apps when I’m not working, but that would mean I would need to set up two focus modes and manually approve every person/app that can send me notifications? 

Why not have an option to start with my default notifications and turn things off from there? I feel like that would’ve been way simpler for users.

Oh phew! I sometimes forget how human/cool the mods are here :p Let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions!


Won’t matter anymore but if you hit the share button from the browser there is an option to open in Apollo

https://i.imgur.com/19LIwX3.jpg


❤️


$2 to solve one of my biggest headaches with Google search (dark mode rolling out solved the other one) is the easiest choice I've made all week (granted, it's Monday, but I bet it'll still be come the end of the week). Especially since it's from a developer who I already enjoy supporting due to how high quality Apollo is.


Amp is basically google creating a link to cached content so the original web page isn’t actually loading. It’s displaying in a google rendering of the original page. The original page doesn’t get the view count or ad revenue or whatever. The amp links make the pages difficult to view sometimes, and it’s hard to get away from them.


Someone could right me it am wrong but since no body answered I am gonna try anyways. 

It is like when you open a page from google search in mobile you open a page with the domain google. It is supposed to ensure all websites run smooth on mobile. I hate it because I can’t use reader mode on it. I think people hate it for privacy reasons.


Let me know if you finish the game!


I think that is nice for sure, but I wonder with this layout though if only power users will click on update to iOS15 especially if it shows your device being up to date and if users aren't being prompted to update left and right (haven't gotten any update notifications personally). If they keep the experience like this, assuming they don't flip a switch later once iOS15 doesn't have as much critical bugs and start pushing people to update, then potentially the upgrade stats for iOS15 could be an all time low in recent years.
 
Why this matters is that in years with second fall updates like for Mac/iPad (i guess iPad has all been launched now?), Apple tends to use those second keynotes to brag about iOS/MacOS update stats. While I'm sure even a half-assed update effort would still beat out what gets managed on the Android front, the numbers will definitely have to be spun not to compare against previous years.

A lot of assumptions for sure but I was just so confused and thought my device wasn't able to be updated at first and immediately what sprung to mind was staged rollouts like Google/Microsoft.


It’s still odd they wouldn’t put it at the top.


With iOS and MacOS integration most Apple chip-level patches will probably be similar so they need a way to patch security separately because they been doing this on Intel MacOS.


I might have just missed it but is there a reason they kept iOS 14 as like an LTS version?

I know they’re allowing 14 with security updates but I never learned why they’re doing that. Just for legacy hardware? Or some other reason?

I think it’s great tbh that they’re doing it. But it’s very unlike Apple.


Mine was right in view on my 12 Pro Max, possible that it was because I have text size at minimum though


[deleted]


I think this would be the reason as well. I am currently downloading iOS 15 right now and it's slow as molasses (as expected with just being released).


I thought the same but I’m sure 99.9% of people don’t care, it’s only a small percentage of power users who care enough to download the update the second it comes out.


The new update is to carrier 47.1


Are you sure you didn't already have these speeds? The only thing the update did was add the icon.


Heads up - that's not new.

iOS 15 just seems to make a bug in iOS where it'll stick on low-band 5G (long range, low speed) instead of mid-band (what T-Mobile calls "ultra capacity") happen less often.

You should've had theses speeds months ago, if not for Apple breaking things horribly in iOS 14.5.

The new carrier update also adds an icon when you're connected to midband (2.5GHz) or mmWave 5G.


You’re likely now using some of the reframed spectrum from T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint. Band 41.


Same here, downloaded super fast but preparing update took 15-20 minutes. Fully installed now though.


What is happening when it is being prepared?


same here, have the update fully downloaded yet it will not install, have 11GB free. Let me know if you find a solution


I like how Apple gave users the option to have on bottom or top.


My 11 says 3.00 as well


Same. I think I'll wait a couple days to see how iOS fares before finally installing it.


Not sure if it's a permanent upgrade or a temporary one. When I go to settings I see 0.99 for 50GB plan.


With iOS 15 your iPhone will charge up to 200% instead of 100%

Just got done restoring mine from back up through recovery mode and I’ll try again here in a few minutes.


Didn’t work for me, but hopefully will work for others!


I’m guessing it’s the one where Settings says you’re almost out of space when you aren’t even close.


Alarm time input reverted from [a numpad in iOS 14](https://i.imgur.com/LOaybRB.jpg) to dial wheels in iOS 15.


It's great for making tweaks to existing alarms, but sucks for setting a new alarm.


You can tap the iOS 15 picker to bring up the keypad and just type in the time in half a second instead of futzing with stupid wheels like you’re Scott Forstall in 2007.


California my bad haha


You swipe them to the left to clear and to the right to open. Now you can only tap on them to open. Now I have to unlearn my muscle memory. This sucks!


I have an 11 Pro so this shouldn’t be a problem though.


Yeah I’m big stupid. Didn’t realize you could either slide down when the notification (banner) is first received, or inside of Notification Center you can press and hold on the notification to get the quick reply menu. But in my defense I don’t think it’s as intuitive as on 14, as I didn’t see this changed mentioned in any review or release note


I'd go with a foot analogy.


Probably because iOS 14 already had widget support


Yeah this is a stupid shit attitude (from Apple). They can protect their ignorant users by having an opt-in checkbox with an extra alert telling you that you're going to download a 5GB update which could result in hefty data charges. But what they do is they totally disable it while there are millions of users who have plenty of data available, often at higher speeds than their home wifi. I've heard this changes with 15, so it seems like they've come to their senses, not the first time that they are late to the party.


I know it’s not Apple’s style but given that in a lot of countries mobile data is (to some extent) truly unlimited it would be nice to have the choice. I can connect my phone as a hotspot and download a macOS upgrade without a problem so why not this. 

My mobile data has been more reliable than what my cable provider was delivering so we cancelled that.

I’d say i easily use 1-2 Gigabytes a day.


Many don't even have Wifi and just live with their mobile, why should they be forced to go to a shitty café or something to update? Makes no sense to lock this down.

I have free data so it's just infuriating.


[deleted]


Yeah seems like it. I‘ve read somewhere, that they changed/updated the font as well.


That would explain it thanks haha


Ohh interesting. Does that not apply anymore?


No. Most people who still use a 16GB iPhone use iTunes to update their phone, because it’s very hard to clear up enough space to download it directly onto their phone.


Get the devs on zoom, stat.


I heart you- mine is now moved back


That’s not exactly what I meant. I mean this page used to be like a deck of cards to flip instead of this 2 x N matrix:
   
https://i.imgur.com/7bTmDvi.jpg


With profile ? If you delete profile you will get the public release


it’s definitely uglier on ipad


Gonna try that. Thanks


It’s phenomenally bad looking. It makes an expensive, premium device look like a low rent knockoff with shit just thrown everywhere. It’s especially frustrating that widgets just fucking move randomly when you change from portrait to landscape. It’s so amateur. I can’t fathom how Apple thought this was a good idea.


That’s so annoying! This was one of the biggest parts of the update for me!


I think you misread the post you are answering to.


I fixed it, i deleted my beta account and it restarted then it popped up


Yeah, I know, not gonna work though, lost cause.

Literally anything would be a better user experience than opening weather.com in Safari


> It now tells you when you can expect precipitation in your area (as well as when it will stop).

I've had this in 14 for quite a while.


The precipitation checker is really shitty. It literally is not raining sometimes and it shows it and on raining days it changes every 10 min to update if it’s raining or not. 

I think a faster way to check if it’s raining is just  a weather radar or looking out the window


2FA on websites and apps isn't really meant to save you if somebody gets access to your phone. It's more meant to stop somebody from accessing the site from afar by guessing your password or obtaining it in a leak.


Maybe, but the previous method of having an Authenticator app was on my phone too. It's not like I was using an RSA token before.

The way I see it, the password and second factor were already in one device; it's just in the same app now.


Not really. One-time passwords are meant to protect against brute-force attacks and phishing. Any internet-facing password can technically be brute-forced, so the OTP is an effectively un-brute-forceable second requirement for login. 

Apple passwords are usually randomly generated and long, which makes them effectively un-brute-forceable anyways, but that’s where phishing comes in. If someone emails you a fake notification for a site you use and tricks you into clicking on it, they can redirect you to a website that looks exactly like the real one and get you to enter your username and password. Even if you are not normally someone who falls for scams, some of these can be pretty convincing and fool you if you aren’t paying close attention to the URL and certificate. But unless they have the initial seed for the one-time password, they can’t do anything with your username and password even if they fool you into giving them the OTP as well.

They literally just pushed a decent update for windows access like last week.

It’s more usable on windows than macOS now, since you can use any browser unlike being locked to safari on the mac.


>	They didn’t really announce a date for iOS either, unless I missed it in the event. 

They did mention specifically today on their website.


This is essentially what I'm doing too. 

However, there is no clean way to handle "Allowed Notifications and Apps" I still want notifications from all apps and people to come through and the only way to do that is to manually check every single contact in my list and every app that I have installed. Plus if I add a new contact or a new app, I'm assuming I'd have to go back and update the focus mode and add them to the "Allowed" list.  There really needs to be an "Allow all" option.


This is a good idea - I hope we’ll get better options soon but this is at least something. I’m going to give this a shot.


As a recruiter who uses the personal phone for work, I can't work around the fact that they don't let me allow a full pass through of calls and texts. They should give more freedom to the user to choose to allow a full pass-through on the phone and text apps. As designed, it's unfortunately unusable for me for a work Focus.

I was really excited to block all my personal stuff during the work day and just have a home screen of basically my calendar and work apps. I guess there's always iOS 16...


Oh that makes sense, I should have thought of that


Did they serve Poutine?


Might be fixed in the upcoming update, but the "distinguish" feature has been broken for comments for me on the current version. No other complaints!


>	I sometimes forget how human/cool the mods are here


Wow. I’ll delete your number and leave your mod team u/iamthatis. I’m offended.


Just bought Amplosion. No more AMP pages? Sign me the hell up! (I’m also an Apollo Ultra user, your app blows away the official app (I’m a veteran of Alien Blue and was so pissed when Reddit killed it, but your App has more than taken its place for me!)


Ayyyyy, I’ve been on the Apollo subreddit since back when there were like sub 10k users before the global release


>	Let me know if you have any feedback/suggestions!

Just excitedly waiting for the iPad version (͡•_ ͡• )


That works like 95% of the time but I’ve had issues especially in discord because of the way it works. 

This is an awesome update and I’m so happy to support this app but man I really hate iOS with the lack of a true intent system for default apps like android. 

It’s my only gripe with the operating system but it’s a big one.


Google is cancer. AMP is 1% of the problem.


What is the headache? I’m not sure I know what AMP is.


Thank you for the explanation and confirming my suspicions that I do indeed hate AMP. Luckily /u/iamthatis has us covered.


I’ve got a feeling Apple just won’t mention the iOS15 upgrade numbers unless they’re good. 

I think you’re right that this will make it so only the people who really want iOS15 will get it. At least in the early months. It’s not like Apple couldn’t push a notification telling people that it is available.


I don’t think they gave a reason. My assumptions are they are doing it so people with older phones who are afraid every update will kill their battery life and performance aren’t forced to update. I also think they want to make sure that not everyone updates immediately so they can iron out bugs without impacting most people. Most people don’t update until their phone notifies them and with them kind of hiding the update it will only be the most eager (and presumably most willing the deal with issues) who will update. 

I also think they’re getting close to cutting off full feature updates for old phones. I don’t know how long they can support 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and older SoCs without advanced ML and multicore setups. This might be a way to grease the skids a little bit for that.


Ah, i’m on 14.6 and TMobile 46.0.2


I’m always curious about if I’m finally getting *5g speeds*, so I check pretty regularly - and as recently as yesterday afternoon.

But I guess it’s possible something changed between then and before I updated my modem settings.


Not the prettiest icon, adding clutter where space is already congested.


I’ve been on iOS 15 for months, and have had the RC installed for a few days (and still do) with the slow speeds. 

Literally only after the carrier update did things change.


It is being prepared.


Same on my 11 Pro Max (3.00.00)


Am I able to crank the volume up to 11 finally?


Does it finally let you download more RAM?


Does it block Youtube ads ?


Did people not realize that you could still scroll the numbers on the time in iOS 14?


If you tap the dial it brings up the numpad.


Nice thanks! Now there are 2 people who know about this feature


That’s true, but now we’ve added an extra tap to the fastest possible use-case for a time-picker. 

The whole point of a time-picker is to be as fast as possible because it’s something you use in rapid bursts thousands of times over. Minimizing extra taps is always a design goal in UI, but especially in something like this.

The scroll-wheel lovers could already scroll through the hours/minutes in the old (iOS 14) time-picker too, but the functionality was not obvious and many didn’t realize they could do it.

So in summary: we’ve made the fastest method take longer, in order for the slower and outdated method to be more obvious for holdouts.


True, but the wheels *used* to work better than they do now. 

On an alarm you could spin a bit and tap save and it would save it at the time it was showing. On newer versions the animation must come to a *complete* stop, tapping ‘save’ before it stops saves the original time. 

Source: me waking up at my original alarm time.


This was probably pressure from carriers to prevent gigantic downloads so they can continue to be cheap.


Downloading is no issue for me. It’s always the preparing the update that takes forever.


It is not only the time needed to download the package, but also checking and installing it.


It does.  They changed the way they realize revenue from iPhone sales to account for it.

Basically when you buy an iOS device for lets say $1000.  Apple says "We got a sale of $990 from that device, and $1 from it when we release the next iOS version, and so on and so on."


Good question I would assume not, as the main point was not being able to provide a new feature that didn’t exist on the device at the time of purchase


Deleted the profile first


Yes my home screen looks so bad now with the empty space


Did it work?


Apple has announced the first US states that will support iOS 15’s new ability to store driver’s licenses and state IDs in the Wallet app. Arizona and Georgia will lead the way, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah following after that. No timetable is given for exactly when the new feature will be adopted by these states, however: Apple only says that consumers can expect “more information at a later date.” And the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has again confirmed it will open select airport checkpoints and security lanes to Apple’s mobile IDs once states begin making them available.


Yep same here in Canada.


I think Apples implementation makes the right trade offs for the general public. 

Most people struggle with using an app like authy. Auto fill has made SMS 2fa (and now TOTP/HTOP 2fa) viable for that demographic.

Ideally your password and 2fa token are stored on separate devices. 

Yubikeys can store your 2fa codes (up to 32 codes) and have an app for copying codes off the key. 

TL;DR Use anything other than SMS 2fa. 


SMS 2fa is extremely insecure and we need as many websites as possible to drop support for it. Attacks like sim jacking wouldn’t be possible if we all just used authenticators.


Where do I get this?


Huh, just doesn't respond at all? No error? Strange…


Strange all the times I do it through Apollo it works, this comment for instance


I need my reworked UI!!!!!


Basically it's consolidating the internet into the hands of Google. Since they run the search, they can choose to de-rank pages that don't properly support AMP and AMP pages are hosted on Google servers too.


>I’ve got a feeling Apple just won’t mention the iOS15 upgrade numbers unless they’re good.

30% better than competitors


No, but they did make 10 louder.


On browser yes but on the app no


I didn't. And I disliked the typing input


Holy shit that's mind blowing.


I opened the app because I did like the option to type and intuitively tapped on the numbers and realized it was there before reading this comment. So maybe more people will find out eventually.


Cheap? None of the US carriers are particularly cheap.


And the iPhone wasn’t subject to this, only iPod touch. Apple was basically able to claim that your subscription from your carrier was also a subscription for software updates, so they didn’t have to charge.


Yes! Thanks 🤗


Yeah, and like, you still need either my face and device or password and device, so I don't feel like it's some totally unsecure thing. Someone still couldn't remotely log into my account because they'd need my phone to get the code.


iCloud for Windows in the Microsoft Store


Haha it actually does respond, it just doesn't do it! So if there's a comment, and I tap the "..." then "Moderator" then "Distinguish" it actually gives me the "Distinguished Comment!" green notification at the top, and my user name actually does turn green as well, but then if I refresh the feed, it's not distinguished, and the user name is back to white.

There’s also a bug that sometimes if I pull to refresh the mod queue or mod mail it duplicates the list, but I’m trying to not push my luck here haha. I know mod tools are only for a very small subset of users and I’m grateful with how robust they already are. Having the native removal reasons available in the app is a game changer, and even the native Reddit app doesn’t do it.


Can you try posting a comment undistinguished, and then distinguishing it and see if it works?


Very true. But this seems still like quite a shift. It's one thing to say they will allow people to say on iOS14, but this actually seems a deliberate shift to keep most users on iOS14 and only let the power users who even care to update to iOS15 try it out.


From here on out, each new iPhone gets one louder.


Unfortunately, there’s no way to block ads in the app without jailbreaking (or buying YT Premium).

YouTube’s website used to be a good alternative to the app, but then they went and ruined it, like they do with everything.


We’re up to 3!!


Cheap in the sense of spending money/making less money instead of just giving it to investors.


I think if you manually refresh the comment section again, it shows up as green (at least for me)


Hmm, gotcha on this. Well it doesn't sound too hard to investigate these at least, it's probably just a nut or bolt loose somewhere. It's on my list!


Testing testing, 1,2,3 (now distinguishing)


Test

Edit: nope, refreshing or leaving the comment section and coming back and it isn’t distinguished anymore.

Edit 2: [Proof!](https://imgur.com/a/r6e6rtN)


Thanks! Honestly much bigger issue right now... Apollo is insta-crashing on launch on my M1 Mac!


So it worked huh?


Seems to have, though a few seconds later the app crashed, so that’s something


Hm weird. I tried deleting and reinstalling and everything and I just cannot get it to work lol


How's the relationship between Apple and Sony?


If Sony would add AirPlay to the PS5, I'd have all my TV media needs covered in one device.


It definitely fits Apple’s aesthetic.


https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPNG2VC/A/sony-playstation-dualsense%E2%84%A2-wireless-controller


I would be very happy if DualSense was universally supported and implemented unilaterally with full, Mic, Speaker and advanced Haptics on all platforms.


Now if only Apple and Sony would partner up so they’d bring Apple Music to PS5.


Does that mean I can finally charge the controller with my Mac's USB C charger?


Neat.  I wish they would add Apple Music or Airplay 2 support to Playstation 5 and I'd be really happy.  It's really my last hold out of ditching Spotify.

  
Edit: Also Playstation remote play on AppleTV PLEASE!


What a weird timeline we live in.


Sell me some ps5 apple lol


Are there any IOS apps that take advantage of the dualsense’s haptics/adaptive triggers?


Funny how remote play is better on Apple devices than Sony’s own android phones.


but, isnt there an audio jack on the controller? how they gonna deal with that?


If only Remote Play worked for me. I’d love to be able to play my PS5 on my MacBook. But it disconnects every time.


Hope this could spark the implementation of airpods connectivity for the ps5


Now to get AirPods to work on my Ps5.


It's also simply the best and most fully featured controller at the moment. I wonder how well implemented their driver is as far as haptics and adaptive triggers go. It would be cool to get a DualSense testing app for iPhone or something.


I wish the Apple store started selling PS5 as well ha.


So now y'all want the white one again, right? 😂


What are some fun games to play on Apple Arcade? I just go the free trial this week but still haven’t played. I just keep going back to resident evil

Any good games compatible with the dualsense?


Will they add an apple logo? That adds a markup of 150%.


As an Apple boy, this is nice


[MRW](https://media1.giphy.com/media/QGzPdYCcBbbZm/giphy.gif?cid=5e214886f7h53hqtcugjb4n4wlj1ss6bvdgv76hifnr7ofg0&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) there’s more PS5 controllers than actual consoles in the market right now


That's neat. Not enough for me to buy Apple. But neat.


That’s pretty solid news as I can use Apple Card/pay to finance one of these rather than eating the cost up front. That and 2% cash back for Apple store purchases


Might start using. The ds4 works great but I’ve gotten so used to how the ps5 controller feels


Did they fix the haptic shock L2R2 breaking issue?


Apple: Buys all stock of Dualsense controllers

*slaps apple logo on it*

*sells Dualsense for double the price*

*profit*


I wonder how this will affect Sony’s relationship with Epic.


[deleted]


This is barely news considering Apple also sells/sold the DualShock 4.


Is it going to cost 2,000 dollars?


It’d be nice if the AirPods Pro were  compatible with the PS5. That is all.


OH NO DOES THIS MEAN SONY IS LE APPLE OF GAMING?

/s

/s again in case someone comes charging at me.


With Xbox xClouds game streaming service only coming to Androids, PlayStation should make a deal with Apple


Comes fully functional with instant stick drift for the real PlayStation feel!


A finger or two to Microsoft. That is the only reason they would do this.


[deleted]


Waiting for Dualsense support on Android...


*Do the apple released controllers have less functions?*


Who fucking cares. All I've seen in store for months is PS5 controllers. How about some actual bloody PS5's so we can actually have a decent reason to buy those controllers.


So when will apple have ps5 available 😂


when will it be officially comparable with windows :’(


Apple and Sony > Microsoft and Xbox 😤  
Especially now that all I play on my PS5 (and iPhone) is a gacha game (Genshin) :/


Well iPhones can act like remotes for the PS5 so can they start selling the console too? Ya know, since it’s MAY and yet they’re still out of stock.


Amazon: £59.99

Apple Store: £99.99

Calling it.


at least they are selling some non inferior products for once


Not the first device they have sold with obvious design defects.


Wow, personally I think this is kind of a big deal. Rare move for Apple.


When will Apple finally buy Sony?


[removed]


can anyone verify if the connection ( input ms ) is stable becaude on android its a cluster fuck for the ds4


The only place where you can buy one it seems. It’s out of stock everywhere, though I’m in no hurry, there is not a big collection of games on PS5 right now.


Charging cable sold separately?


Will we see AirPods become compatible with ps5?


But can we use our AirPods as mics on ps5s?!


Wait so you can buy an Apple TV and basically have your PS5 on two different TV’s?


[deleted]


Anybody here use one of those DualSense phone mount attachments? What's the experience like? I'm wondering if you need to keep your hands perfectly still, if it's hard to keep your eyes on the screen etc.


Any Mac or iPad games worth playing with this controller?


This is huge news. I could see Apple and Sony partnering very soon, and if that happens I’m going to be really excited for Sony.


Please make a remote play app for appletv


now add accessibility with PS4


Now can we get Native PC support, and version with pressure sensitive buttons. It feels *wrong* playing Metal Gear, Days Gone or Horizon Zero Dawn with anything else.


It's the best controller ever in my opinion, and I own them all.


What if Apple just bought Sony? Would that be bad?


time to buy a dual sense now 👀


If only they would sell the actual console!


Didn’t they (Apple) mention that iPad is getting haptic feedback support on the DualSense? I’m willing to bet this is related to the way the DualSense was received as an inovative controller and Apple maybe want their Apple Arcade games to take advantage of that.


I believe Apple is using Sony screens or lenses in their upcoming VR headset too.


$63 usd with Apple veterans program.


Are they gonna sell the new colors too?


I wonder if Apple will try to be the exclusive platform for PS games to respond to Xbox Play Anywhere?


Cool, now add Apple Music to PlayStation


Wait could you not use PS4 controllers with Macs or something?


Bro I literally just bought a DualShock 4 to use while playing via PS remote on my Mac


they do sell Dualshock 4 controllers.

nothing surprising.


Because Sony hasn’t tried to fuck with apple by putting ps now on their App Store


Does it mean that there will be another way of updating controller firmware besides using a ps5? Cuz I guess there will be a lot of people buying controller with out having the console....that would be nice and necessary.


Haptic feedback?


Any recommendations on games that play well over the internet. Most of the games I play require high latency, FPS & such. Any gems I should download before going on vacation and trying to play the ps5 over the internet?


Any iOS/iPadOS games that fully support controllers, for example the haptic/rumble function?


Sony has been a supplier for Apple for years, especially for the iPhone's camera. The camera is Apple's own design, but they use Sony sensors for the camera and LIDAR.


Sony and Apple's relationship goes [WAY back](http://nobi.com/en/Steve%20Jobs%20and%20Japan/entry-1212.html).


To add to all the comments. It’s also been known that Steve Jobs was a huge fan of Sony and was inspired by them when Sony was the powerhouse it once was. He was often found at Sony’s headquarters in Japan and had a close relationship with Akio Morita, co-founder of Sony. 

Steve Jobs went as far as offering Sony to run OS X on Vaio laptops in the beginning of 2000. The only company to get that offer after Apple stopped selling OS X licenses to other companies. 

So I’d say historically Apple and Sony are on very good terms as well.


I love Apple. I love my PlayStation.  But I can only imagine an alternate universe where Apple somehow buys PlayStation as being absolutely awful


Probably quite good. I bet my money that Apple will be the first to jump in line to buy Sony’s PlayStation arm if it ever goes on sale.


I noticed in one of the recent Apple presentations (maybe for the iPad Air 4th gen or M1 iMacs) they have Sony products clearly visible such as cameras that people in the ads are using.

They definitely seem pretty cozy with one another.


Sony is basically the Apple of the gaming industry so I’m sure they are good pals


They have a good business relationship, and generally I think Apple customers who want to play games are likely to get a Playstation. You can't really game on Mac so people who use them tend to go for consoles. Playstation is flat out more popular than Xbox, plus Apple/Sony both compete with Microsoft.


I don't know if they have any meaningful relationship, at least the Playstation side of Sony has very little relationship/interaction with Apple.


It’s good, but Sony has their hands in way more than just gaming and home entertainment/sound products — those make up less than a third of their revenue. Around 10% is just for semiconductor electronic component manufacturing for example.


I haven’t seen it mentioned but Sony Pictures productions are on AppleTV+. For All Mankind I know for sure is a Sony pictures production. Also the Co-President of Sony pictures last year left and went to Apple.


Sony helps them make money so they probably like them.


I bet they both aren’t fans of epic


Not bad, they went through a rough patch, arguing, falling out, flirting with others, but then after a talk, bit of romance and a hearty meal they got right back at it


Promiscuous on both sides.


Sony+apple against xbox+Samsung du be coming closer to a reality lmaoo


I think Snake in metal gear solid 4 has an iPod that allowed you to scroll through the songs like an iPod but with the thumstick


A lot of Apple users prefer Sony products, from cameras to consoles and TVs. They’re similar companies from design perspectives and Steve Jobs considered a merger with them.


Also Steve Jobs loves Sony. He offered the macOs to sony’s Vaio laptops back in the day but sony wasnt interested.


My Sony X900H already supports AirPlay, which is cool. I guess it wouldn‘t be difficult to implement it into the PS5, but I think the PS5 and AppleTV+Apple Arcade are somewhat direct competitors if you think about it.


It feels really wrong that we can’t do it already 😩


If Sony add HomeKit feature on PlayStation 5 then it will be complete 

Apple TV currently on ps5 , I don’t see the “need” for airplay Actually


What’s the advantage of using AirPlay? Like, what do you use it for? I don’t really understand it and I’m not even sure when AirPlay came out I must have been under a rock. Can I cast my Home Screen of my iPhone to my tv, and scroll thru apps? Or just cast stuff from YouTube, Netflix, etc


Well that and Dolby Vision.


Does it vibrate like it does on the ps5


Also, I would love to use Apple Music instead of Spotify.

Thank god it does not.

Apple needs to get their head out of their ass and let xCloud or PlaystationNow video game streaming on their app store.


Overpriced? You’re right


[deleted]


I half expected Apple to sell it $10-20 more than Sony lmao


Is this different than the stock ps5 controller?


[removed]


I really hope they do


As long as they keep Spotify functionality, I’m down for it. It would cool to see them add Apple Fitness+ as well or even add the Apple Arcade to PS5.


Spotify signed a exclusivity contract to be the only music streaming service on Playstation


I hope not, because that would most likely mean the removal of Spotify, which is very useful because it's cross platform and just works whether you're on iPhones, Androids, PC, Mac, Linux etc.

I'm actually just surprised that Sony didn't integrate their own Sony music app into the PlayStation.


fuck apple music. SoundCloud is the way


I would prefer the ps remote play app on Apple TV


You already can. I exclusively charge the controller like this


Yup, and Mac USB-C charging cable it’s probably the best one to connect controller with PS5. :)


A USB c is a USB c, Mac or not


I have been doing this since I got my 5


I do this, it matches the aesthetic super well


YES, PS Remote Play on Apple TV would be a game changer. I can’t think of any good reason Sony or Apple wouldn’t want it. (Maybe Apple thinks it would compete with Apple Arcade, but… no.)


Not really. Apple hardware is super high quality, and Sony have finally caught up with PlayStation hardware quality. With the rumors of Apple developing their own game controller, I don't see how they can do anything superior to the DualSense while also fitting their brand aesthetic. Aluminium would be a horrible material for a controller. Shiny, untextured plastic too. The weirdest timeline for me would be if Apple actually creates their own dedicated game controller.


Right. What even is this article. Why is anyone making a $70 controller for a console that nobody can buy. They should try making the console itself first.


What kind of phone you have? It works fine on Sony's top tier phones.


Works great on mine.

What problems are you having?


Android has Chiaki which is better than the official client, anyway.


I am working on setting mine up still. You don’t have to be on the same network to play remotely once they are connected right ?


I’ve had minor stuttering on a brand new wi-fi 6 router hardwired to PS5, and MacBook Pro 2019, iPad all act the same. What’s your secret?


That’s cause Android sucks.


Works exactly the same for me


i don’t get if you’re trying to be funny or are genuinely curious


Sell a dongle to cover it up.


Courage.


Take it off.


I just found out today I can play the PS5 on my iPad with the DualSense controller. I guess this is common knowledge, but holy shit that's cool. Now I can [play in my office](https://i.imgur.com/RxaIJWj.jpg) while I'm in meetings.


Mine works perfectly if a few stutters and it’s a 2012 MacBook lol. The new ones aren’t built like the used to!


PS5 doesn't have *any* Bluetooth audio, even for Sony's own hardware. Neither did the PS4. Just seems like they're not interested in figuring out the challenges of that.


Haha I think Sony might want to invest some time making their own Bluetooth headphones work with PS5 before helping Apple make more 💰 with airpods.


If you don’t need the mic from them, connect them to your TV (assuming your TV has Bluetooth)


They don’t work? They’re just Bluetooth so I don’t see why not.


Eh, every controller has its pros and cons. The DualSense is fantastic, but it has a bad d-pad, no dedicated pairing button, lackluster battery life, and is pretty heavy. Not to mention drift issues, but that's not unique to the DualSense.

Edit: Happy cake day!


It isn't the best, there is no best. The low battery life and bad sticks are major negatives.


Fantasian is compatible with the DualSense.


Just to touch on that. You can buy a new PS5 controller for half the price on StockX, so clearly something is wrong with the quantity


Controllers don't need processors to work lol


Huh? What do you mean? Of course there would be more controllers than consoles. Almost everyone has at least 2 controllers, whereas most would only have 1 console.


Great ad read


What exactly is this? For me (on iPad), only the resistive triggers work on PS5 games (neither haptic feedback or rumble work) and then rumble works normally on PS4 games.


If it’s the same as DualShock 4, Bluetooth pairing mode is activated by holding the PS button and Share button together for 5 seconds


Because DS4 was supported by Apple. DualSense is just now being supported, which is the announcement. Selling the controller is just a bonus.


You can use Bluetooth, headphones only, with the right adapter.


Works on iOS.. you just run it via browser & save it as an APP shortcut.. super cool!


You could check the apple store and see it’s the same price as anywhere else.


Hopefully never? As a Sony consumer that is the last thing you should want.

Yes. Any USB-C cable will do.


No, the PS Remote Play app is not available on Apple TV


It's just a controller, Apple used to sell Xbox controllers on their site too.


Not all of them are good with controller but I liked these games on Mac/iPad

Not sure why people think a company can just buy another company. A company has to actually be willing to sell


Yeah, worth noting that Sony is the exclusive sensor provider of Apple


Sony isn't only supplying for Apple. In fact Sony is the camera sensor supplier for almost half of the phones sold worldwide.


Sony provides the LIDAR?


Being a supplier doesn’t mean a good relationship. Samsung has been a huge supplier from day 1 for Apple and still is and go look at their relationship.


I mean my android has Sony sensor to. It's just business haha


>	Sony has been a supplier for Apple for years

I mean, so has Samsung and a bunch of other Asian tech companies. It doesn't really tell you much.


Wow, so Jobs was really fond of Sony, never knew that.


If they have a close relationship then why the hell isn’t Apple Music available in PlayStation 5?


Yeah that would be terrible.

Imagine the PS6 being insanely powerful yet having access to Apple Arcade exclusives and forcing Sony to put any first party on Apple Arcade with third party devs having this huge buy-in requirement and strict rules.

“We think you’re gonna love it”


I am wondering though, what would the budget look like for the game studios like Naughty dog and Insomniac, it'd be crazy to see what they could do with an even bigger budget.


PlayStation is the biggest brand in all of gaming. They keep sony afloat. No way would they sell PlayStation. And no way would a japnese company sell to an american company.


What, you don't want F2P gacha games on your $500 game machine, and exclusives requiring a subscription?


Lol although I don't ever see Sony losing the Playstation branch, that'd be crazy to see Apple purchase Playstation regardless of asking price for them.


Like Sony would ever sell PlayStation.

Why do you think that Sony is the Apple of the gaming industry? If anything Nintendo is the Apple of the gaming industry. The walled garden, the underpowered hardware compared to competitors, a fanbase that will buy anything you sell, anti consumer business practices, creating a false sense of premium.


if you mean by popularity (specifically in NA) , sure I'll give you that. But if you mean by innovation and technology, no not at all

seems some disagree so allow me to explain. Apple was innovative by inventing the smart phone and perfect the basic model but more recently they haven't done much to further technology in that field. Samsung is over here putting fingerprint scanners in the screen, making foldable phones and tablets, having an advanced iris scanner rather than simply a facial one, and I think they're watch looks a little cooler but that ones just an opinion. Then you have Apple, who yes have good cameras but the quality and look of the phones they make is getting worse yet the price tag rises. I hoped that helped clear up my point


I mean clearly they have some type of relationship


Dude I have the same TV. I fucking love it. I’ve never looked at a possession and been so proud of it. I don’t even watch TV. I just play PS5. 

Just wanted to share, I get excited whenever someone has the same set up as me. This TV fucking rocks


I’d like to disagree with this since you got to consider what part of the market their both aiming for. AppleTV doesn’t compete with any of Sony’s offerings (their movies and stuff on psn store has been long dead now) and Apple Arcade is more aimed toward mobile users who don’t have/will not have/ can’t afford (tho i find ironic lol but you can think of the kids that just got an iPhone as a gift) a console or gaming PC.


You get any problems with apps loading on your x900h? I have to restart mine every now and then to get an app to load or get my sound back


You can do full screen mirroring


You can screen mirror from any apple device, including Macs and MacBooks.


I’m not even close to being a fan of Apple Music but I 100% support that Apple Music should be allowed on PlayStation cuz they cant play their own music on it which is fucked


I wonder if it’s also because Microsoft is a more direct competitor to Apple


Probably also because Microsoft and Apple are on opposite sides of the big App Store debate


I love the aesthetics, but goddamn that thing takes up way too much space in my media cabinet.


Apart from the media remote. It has like an ugly curved bulge at the bottom - you know, so that you can’t lay it down on any surface without it spinning around.


> The design of the PS5

Strong disagree with the console, but agree on everything else.

The console seem to be the exact opposite of Apple. Apple is very simple. PS5 has completely unnecessary (serves no purpose) collars that stick into the air.

In general though, I agree that the controller really does match Apple's design theory.


I couldn’t disagree more about the console itself. I own one and it’s absolutely ugly, I wish I could hide it is so bulky, awkward, and an eye sore.


[deleted]


[deleted]


Idk man. The PS5 with the disk drive poking out like a pimple? Ugly


The console looks over designed and is just generally shit.


Not going to happen unless they get a cut of the subscriptions.

While I don't know much about PlaystationNow, Xbox Cloud Gaming (formerly called xCloud) is very likely to become a major revenue stream to Microsoft once consoles are mostly phased out (which is likely to happen in the next 10 years).

So it is unlikely they will sharethat fat revenue with Apple, at least in terms of percentage.

I think it's more likely they launch their own version  of a switch (a portable that can stream games and be docked to play streming games) for a very low price (think 199 or less) than giving apple anything over 5% of gamepass revenue (on IOS).


You alright my dude? You having a stroke?


It’s actually 4cents cheaper, what a deal


Lol.


Yes. NO CHARGER CABLE. DONT DO IT


This is why I PC. Imagine not having an option to listen to any music service you already pay for on a device.


I’m strongly in Spotify solely for PlayStation streaming. As soon as I have an alternative for PS, I’m switching to Apple Music. My student Spotify discount finally ended this year


Not to mention that Sony is large minority shareholder in Spotify.


Damn. When’s that expire?


Really? Mine can never grab a charge from it. Hmm gotta try it again.


I honestly thought you could only charge them through the PS5, good to know with the lack of ports on the system. Thanks mate 👍


Because a controller doesn’t have the same components as the console. There’s also more than one conveyor belt in a factory.


Did they add adaptive trigger support to the Android version of Remote Play? It was added last week to the iOS version.


And it’s not even hating on Android tbh. Apps are generally better on iOS


Yes sir


Based


the fact that you can't tell makes it funnier lol


Was stuttering on my 2017 MacBook Pro then found it hidden somewhere on Reddit that it's because of the near constant Wifi scanning that Location Services triggers. Switch it off (note: it also switches the location part of Find My Mac) and voila, totally uniform streaming. (Unless your console is downloading something and your router can't handle that bandwidth, in which case Remote Play becomes useless.)


Pretty sure it’s just a software limitation, no?

Doesn’t the controller connect via bluetooth?


Even Sony's first party Playstation headphones require a dongle!


The dual sense has an in built mic so I think it’ll work too


The PS5 doesn't support bluetooth audio.  You need a USB adapter.


i think it's just people selling the white one for when the black one comes out


So I found out after buying 2 ps5 controllers that the L2 R2 haptic resistance mechanisms is prone to breaking in as short a time as a few days since purchase. It's a disaster for the ps5 controller, way too many reports. Keep your receipt close, that is all I can say.

Hostile takeovers for public companies are possible.


I mean, it’s worth something. 

I know, autocorrect lol


They are actually the supplier for many companies, because let’s be honest they are known for their cameras


Samsung does the screens, so I don’t think this automatically implies anything


Sony makes majority of camera phone sensors, their cameras are actually insane


most of the actual camera sensors (Fujifilm, Canon, Nikon) are Sony too.

*Fond?*

Steve was so inspired by Sony providing a company uniform to each of its workers that he tried and failed to introduce the same to Apple. Well, almost. That is what inspired him to adopt his iconic uniform of Issey Miyake turtlenecks and jeans for life.


Bc they have a deal with Spotify


Spotify signed a long term deal for exclusive music streaming rights on PS hardware


This would be a real dream come true lol


There are so many better ways to listen to music than on your ps5 lol


I doubt it would be that much bigger. Sony has 40B in cash, they give pretty high budgets to games. And I don't think their is a single game that could benefit to having a budget higher then say, 200 million, which is a budget Sony can give to their first parties. So Apple would probably give around the same amount of money that Sony does.


It would likely be the same as it is now, tens of millions of dollars; Naughty Dog games are very expensive to produce due to the high production quality


Yeah if anything Apple would have to buy the entirety of Sony. They could use the movie/TV/Music content too.


It’s literally it’s biggest and most profitable division. It’ll never go up for sale lol


Nintendo buys it and we come full cycle back to the Nintendo Playstation

edit: I’ll just make an edit here, it’s a joke guys. I doubt Sony will ever sell off Playstation to begin with


[deleted]


Theres no sony without playstation. Apple or Microsoft dont need xbox, but sony NEEDS the Playstation.


The mere concept foreigners buying a Japanese conglomerate like Sony is laughable. Nintendo actually laughed at Microsoft for trying to buy them back in the early aughts.


I literally use apple music everyday, I need that.


It would probably be better than the Spotify integration


Lmfao


Nintendo is like Apple on the pricing and exploiting fans side of things. Sony is like Apple on the setting the trends and selling “premium” side of things.


Apple has underpowered hardware now? LOL


>	underpowered hardware

Lmao.


Also the walled garden aspect. The console and peripherals have similar aesthetics too


Oh yeah they have only done the Dual Analog sticks, Bluray, pushing VR, pushed 3D gaming the hardest and set the standard, CD-Rom, Dualshock which set the standard for vibration in game controllers till this day and now the Daulsense will do it again with amazing haptic feedback and active triggers, force sensitive buttons, Touch pad, motion sense, gyro, universal media disk, PS+ which brought about games with gold, Shareplay and remote play, eyetoy which was a likely inspiration for the Kinect, PlayTV, folding@home, OLED screens with Vita and VR, Backwards compatability, USB ports, making gaming more casual outside of just gamers by doing games such as Singstar and eyetoy, I think PS2 was also the first console you could install a HDD.

There is no other console manufacturer out there that innovates and has as much influence as Playstation does. Give me a list of Nintendo or Xbox innovations if you think they have done more.


Oh yeah I managed to get the 55“ for 750€ which is to this date the lowest price in Germany yet. And it was worth every penny!


Same.  The one single gripe that I have is how finicky it is with eARC and internal audio sources (like Android TV apps).  I have to reboot the TV all the time to get audio from Android TV to work.

Other than that, though, it's simply amazing.


Agreed! Great picture, very responsive, nice sound, ps5 looks fantastic on it with very little adjustment. TV itself looks fantastic in the room. 10/10

Glad I snagged one last year, they're hard to find now


Guerrilla marketing at its best.


Yeah I can agree with your reasons, was just a sidethought though anyways.

Microsoft bailed Apple out of Bankruptcy in the 1990s


Nah, they’ve sold Xbox controllers as well as other types in the past. They just have Apple Arcade and a pretty huge gaming platform in iOS/iPadOS but have decided to support a bunch of controllers instead of making their own. And if they can sell it to you directly then that’s a bonus.


They absolutely serve a purpose, they’re to ensure theres clearance around the console to allow decent airflow to the cooling system.


Yeah there’s nothing apple-like about console.  That doesn’t fit their design approach at all.


How is saying that something is beautiful participating in a console war? I personally really think the aesthetic of the PS5 family is really nice, but I also think that competitors also have a solid and visually appealing look.

You can appreciate the design of multiple things.


It’s especially hilarious since the dualsense looks really similar the original Xbox one controller. 

It really just comes down to them being competitors. Yes they said both work, but by showing you the dualsense they are subconsciously telling you that one is the preferred one.

Oh and they work with Sony, so yeah no surprise they show their suppliers product.


[deleted]


....why do people call controllers remote?


Apple opts for straight lines and simple curves when they can. PS5 is def not something Apple would have done.


What did he say?


I'm sorry,i was away and my phone's not locked while i was afk. Probably my sibling took control of the phone,does my sibling say anything bad while i was away?


Buy in bulk from Apple, sell online at retail price, instant profit.


There is no charge cable with the stock duelsense aswell


Ahhh, that’s rough. I prefer Spotify because it has more of the music I listen too, the algorithm is better for new music (for me), and I like the interface more. Outside of that Apple has a good chunk of my business lol


how does spotify handle the student discount? i’m with apple music, and all they ask for is a university email. i haven’t been a student for over a year at this point and still get the discount lol


Looks like they started 6 years ago, and best I can tell never said length of the deal

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/28/sony-playstation-music-unlimited-spotify


My controller is extremely picky about what charges it. When it's turned off most chargers work, when it's turned on the only thing that works is my 65w laptop charger.


My M1 MacBook Air charger works for this, did it the other day out of desperation while on a hell of a Returnal run 😆 

https://i.imgur.com/SpI3MBw.jpg


I have never tried this with my Mac charger, but I guess it depends on the power rating of the specific charger you're using. For example, I have tried charging a USB-C Anker power bank with my MacBook Pro charger (60W?) and I think the power rating of the charger was just too high, so the PCB was probably protecting itself from getting damaged by refusing to charge with it. I wonder if that is happening to you?


I don't know.

I don't keep up with it that much. I just occasionally use it when the TV is occupied.


It depends on the app tbh.

Like we're all on Reddit app I'm assuming some of us like reddit apps and android is way better in this regard.


hahaha yeah


It's a software limitation, yeah, but the latency and codec issues are the core of the problem that no one has seemed to figure out. It's the same reason why the Switch doesn't have Bluetooth audio despite its controllers being Bluetooth also.

The last time Sony attempted Bluetooth audio on a console was on the Vita, and I can tell you from first hand experience that it is not good at all. The latency is terrible and it only works with some earbuds that have certain codec capability.

It's not as simple as just allowing it. There's a lot of engineering that has to go into it.


I will take the dongle approach over Bluetooth any day. It's a *much* better experience. I love my Platinum headset.


Lol wtf really.


Oh I thought you meant a L2R2 problem exclusive to remote play. I’ve heard this a lot on the sub as well, but still so far so good with my two controllers. However one of them is defective in another way with sticking face buttons and clicky triggers/center button so I’m about to get that replaced. Sorry to hear about your misfortune. Hopefully the next supply of controllers are less prone to problems, because when they work the Dualsense is a game changer


[removed]


When there is uneven leverage to be had. 

Apple could crush their stock value. But, with that, they'd have to deal with other large companies attempting to buy it out.


But Samsung isn't in the console space. Apple is a direct competitor of Microsoft so it would make sense to integrate with the PS5 if they were ever planning on bringing features to consoles.


Not just sensors but the chips and everything is usually Sony guts in cameras and PTZs. If you usually can’t find a manufactures driver for a camera your best bet is try Sony’s cause it’s probably there chipsets inside the camera.


Canon develops their own sensors. They do not use Sony sensors.


Or correctly, LiDAR


It is really uniform if you are the only one?


I wish they had a deal with Pandora too ;\_;


Which IMO is hypocritical. Spotify are very loud when complaining about access to Apple devices (e.g. to the EU), but are happy to close deals which lock out Apple Music from devices that don’t even have anything to do with Spotify.


Damn that sucks, I like Apple Music a lot more than Spotify.


Not while playing a game.


i rather have a google home next to me


Maybe but for some perspective Apple has more cash on hand (over $200b) than Sony's market cap ($120b).


Oh no doubt Sony has the resources, I'm just picturing what they could do with a bigger budget or more resources.


There's a few things within Sony they would like to have. Music, Film/Television, Gaming and even some of the tech stuff like the camera technology which Sony are a leader in. The only stuff they would probaby ditch or sell off would be TV production and life insurance. The phone division would probably be merged into the Apple one


\- How did you buy off the Playstation brand?

\- I bought Sony


Plus they’d want to keep it out of Disney’s hands.  Disney would 100% want Sony’s movie division for Spider-Man alone.


Isn't Sony's biggest and most profitable arm insurance and finance.....by like such a huge margin it makes its electronics look like a joke?

I don’t know if you’re aware of how money works but Nintendo wouldn’t be able to afford Sony on the open market.  Disney, Microsoft, and many others would easily outbid them for their entertainment division alone.


Well if they got PlayStation they wouldn’t need any expertise they’d just let them keep doing what they already do: dominate.


Nintendo and Sony are absolutely demolishing Microsoft right now and have been for the past 4 years in Nintendo’s case and 8 years in Sony’s case. They are doing just fine taking Microsoft on


Microsoft and Apple are the top 2 richest companies right?


It wasn't Microsoft and Sony also didn't really know shit about gaming either, also if Playstation was purchased there would be no need for interference on what they are currently doing, only change would probably be a way larger budget and more acquisitions.


I’m not sure about that. Apple still hasn’t done anything to compete with Spotify’s Connect features. I can control Spotify on my PlayStation from my phone. Unless something changes you couldn’t do that with Apple Music


It's not though. Nintendo is still the "trendy" platform for casuals and they treat themselves as more premium as well by overpricing controllers, games,etc.


They've always had underpowered hardware compared to their competitors. They've made up for it through software. The United you are using the new Air, you are probably using a computer with a dual-core CPU that only rivals budget laptops. The iPhone 12 runs half as much ram as any of its competitors. Their ram is literally equivalent to the industry standard from 4 years ago. They frequently under clock CPUs that are already less powerful than those of competitors. Before you LOL, maybe actually know what you are talking about.


Keep laughing cause you have know clue what you're talking about. Oh I see, your a regular in the Apple subreddit. Can't expect a logical response from the likes of you.


nono I see the misunderstanding now. I think Sony is much more innovative than Apple which is why I think the comparison is bad


Ich Hab leider 1000€ bezahlt, aber würde es wieder tun!


So then it’s likely a deal that gets made


And Apple acknowledges that they aren't competing with the Xbox division: https://us.cnn.com/2021/05/20/cnn-underscored/apple-vp-talks-innovations-for-4k-tv-homekit/index.html


They most likely did that to skirt a possible antitrust lawsuit. It was a calculated business move. They were direct competitors still.


This is true... but I don’t know how relevant it is? 

It’s over two decades later and they are in completely different positions with completely different leadership.


That was much in part thanks to Bill Gates and his personal relationship with Steve Jobs. It was also a *business move*, MS were becoming to cominant and risked getting broken up to prevent a monopoly unless Apple survived


So? Intel essentially kept AMD afloat for years. Doesn’t mean they aren’t competitors lol.

EDIT: Sometimes it’s better to keep the enemy you know vs open up a spot for one you don’t


To avoid antitrust


Apple was never bankrupt. And Microsoft never bailed out Apple. 

It was investors like the Saudi prince who saved Apple from bankruptcy. What Microsoft's deal did was end the lawsuits, fighting etc and get their commitment to port Office to OSX. Money was just a bonus.


If that were the case, it would surround the entire case. A large portion of the exhaust is in the back, which is the critical area to have clearance.

If that was their intention (and I don’t believe it was), then they did a very poor job of executing.


I mean theoretically theres some point they made about brand loyalty and /r/hailcorporate that but at the end of the day the aesthetics are very nice. And thats coming from an Xbox user

I'm an Apple guy and a PS5 guy but the dude saying "and how much Apple loves it too just emphasizes that" kinda rubs off in the wrong way. Apple isn't doing anything special with Sony here that they haven't done with Xbox for Apple to show "how much it loves it".


Digits edition, however is something I could see.


Something like “uhhhh ahhh yeah but uhhhh we aren’t talking about that” or something


“I’m having a stroke” probably


“I just made $5 over the past 6 months. What are *you* doing with your life?”


It was an “Apple bad” joke.


Yeah I’m deep enough in the ecosystem that it makes sense to switch. That and the family plan make it enticing. PS the only thing keeping me these days.


Really? I find Spotify to have a perfect example of how not to do a music UI.

Spotify has some third party verification system now. I should have another two or so years of the allotted four with my edu email, but they can verify I’m not a student anymore.


It’s picky for me too. I was gifted a strange-looking tabletop power bar that is has a bunch of standard 3-prong power outlets and a few USB charging ports. My iPhone works fine with it but with the Dual Sense i always have to turn the power bar off and on before the DS starts charging.


The wattage on the charger is the maximum it can supply, not necessarily what it supplies to the device. My 65w laptop charger works just fine for the dualsense.

The controllers are just super picky about the chargers that work for some reason.


Idk I havnt found a Reddit app I like more then Apollo on iOS.


I mean apps that are available on both platforms usually perform better on iOS just because it’s easier to develop apps for them. Spotify is a big example of this (they still haven’t released the new UI for android users but iOS users have had it since the beginning of last year) Snapchat, Instagram etc etc


A2DP would be enough. Hardly a lot of engineering in the grand scheme of things.


Not to mention using them on Non-PS devices. 

My wireless gold headset works perfectly with my Mac Mini via the USB dongle. No holding buttons, no codes, no lightshows for BT connection. 

Shit just works.


The only Sony console ever to support bluetooth audio was the Vita, and latency was a mess, there.

I mean, Sony and Spotify signed a deal. Now Spotify is the music platform of the PlayStation. It’s just business. I don’t really get how that’s hypocritical, maybe I’m wrong tho


What exactly do you like more about Apple Music? Genuinely wondering, I've been a long time user of Spotify so I've never really used Apple Music before.


Same here, and this limitation is the only reason I haven’t switched to AM


Debatable. I tried using Spotify while playing subnautica and probably a bug with the game, but Spotify would eventually turn itself off and submautica’s bg music would be bugged and not play for that save


That's true but no game is going to need more then say, 200M at most.


It's probably at a point of diminishing returns thing. If it takes $10 to run a game studio and you have $100, if you sell it to someone who has $1000, they're still only going to spend $10 to run it.


Sheeesh


Diminishing returns, so probably not much more.


Sony sells life insurance? That's pretty interesting

That’s from 2011, ps3 did relatively badly, ps4 came out in 2013 and did incredibly well, they started charging for online subscriptions etc. Ps4 momentum has carried into Ps5. PlayStation has done incredibly well for them since 2014 or so.


Not from where i checked... Its up there with the important parts, but Playstation is the biggest business area. Depending on the years, financial gets up to 2nd place.


U are confusing it with samsung


No, you’ve got it mixed up with someone else.


This article is old and is from the time Sony was recovering from a meh PS3 generation and a big recession. It might have been true back then but it’s not true today.


Dude... I’m joking


Fanboyism is weird. Sony didn't do so well with the PS4 just by happenstance. They barely got second place with the PS3 and Vita flopped hard. It's not some bygone conclusion that Sony does well. Success takes work.

Yeah, I'm with you. Nintendo is way more like Apple than Sony (I'm not sure why everyone's fanboying here over that thought anyway). 

Plus, it was known that Nintendo borrowed heavily from Apple's aesthetic and playbook of simplicity/casualness during the Wii/DS era. I mean, just look at a DS lite, it's straight-up a mini MacBook from that generation.


The way iOS and Mac OS use ram is much more efficient so you don't really need a huge amount of RAM. I like also how you conveniently left out how Apples own processors are like 2 generations ahead of Qualcomm processors. They completely smoke anything on an Android with raw processing power alone. The new M1 Mac's have processing power faster than i9s for the price of 1000. That's a super good deal.


Just have a look at benchmarks, Apple hardware is lightyears ahead of the competition. Just look at the damn benchmarks, it's so fucking easy. 

I already know what you're gonna say but no, Intel CPUs are NOT Apple hardware.


I mean it would be terrible for their current lawsuit in which Microsoft is on Epic’s side, if Apple said they are competitors with Xbox. That would be clear anti-competitive behaviour holding the Xbox Game Pass app off of the App Store.


Still doesn't stop all the anti consumer bs apple does.


I thought it was more so the US government funding Apple so there wouldn't be a monopoly case or something. Might be remembering high school incorrectly though.

For all we know Sony just paid Apple to promote the controller. Might just be me being cynical.


Sounds like he’s moaning…


I’m getting ready to charge you 500 to do your taxes thanks.


Oh ok, lmao I guess


How so? Looks exactly like Apple Music, but with more music related features


Facts, Apple Music also has lyrics, music videos, better sound quality and in my experience it’s just much smoother / bug free. I couldn’t imagine going back to Spotify.


I've had luck turning the controller off (hold PS button for 10 seconds), plugging in, then turning the controller back on as well.


Yea all well and good but it still depends on the app itself.

Like Firefox for android is a great example. No amount of ios being better is going to let you install extensions on it.

Easy money answer is the google suite apps. If you use a lot of stuff like Photos, Assistant, Gmail, etc you will be better off on android. Its a given but you know, still.

Still a good general rule of thumb is ios runs things better than android but...tbh I wouldn't base a purchase of Android or ios on that alone but thats besides the point.


Very high latency. Not a good experience for games. That's the codec the Vita used for its Bluetooth audio and it sucks. Maybe if you're listening to Spotify or something on PS5 it would be fine.


Yep, I use it for everything. My PC, my MacBook, my Switch, my PS5, everything. 

I wouldn’t have bought them if they were Bluetooth only. It’s so painless to just plug the dongle into a USB port.


Well Vita’s not a console, but I get your point

I surprise to be sure, but a welcome one


I don't understand radar but now you're making me think that it should be RaDAR lol


Not OP, but I like being able to import my own tracks to the cloud. It's an awesome feature for remixes and songs that isn't in the catalogue. Plus I have Apple One so for me it turns out to be cheaper.

I wish they had lossless audio and crossfade though.


Not the user you asked the question to, but I have used Spotify since it’s debut, but switched to Apple Music for a year or so before switching back to Spotify, due to a minor but annoying UI redesign that has since been eradicated.

I thought the music sounded a little better, but I’m not sure if that was just a mental justification for switching platforms. The human curated playlists had a different vibe compared to Spotify, and I occasionally enjoyed Beats 1 as an archaic form of music consumption.  

Ultimately, I switched back to Spotify though. Apple has garnered a reputation for products that “just work!” But Spotify just works better with more devices than Apple Music and it is a better tool
For discovering new music.


Your options if you don’t use Spotify are to wear two sets of earphones/headphones or play music out loud from some other source. One of those is uncomfortable and the other is inconsiderate to other people you are playing with online as no one else wants to hear your music.


Subnautica is buggy, in other news, water is wet.

No. No it isn't.


IIRC Red Dead 2, TLOU2, and Halo Infinite all have higher budgets.

Sony do pretty much everything which is somewhat common with a lot of large Japanese conglomerates


That branch used to be their biggest earners. It might still be.


Looks like they have about $200B cash on hand and Disney's market cap is currently $313B so that is not enough to buy just one Disney with just cash on hand.

I know that. Do you understand the difference between HARDWARE and software?.

>I like also how you conveniently left out how Apples own processors are like 2 generations ahead of Qualcomm processors.

Because it's factually incorrect. You're just looking at Max clock speeds without even considering that Apple underclocks their CPUs because of heat issues or that it may have faster single core, but does not stack up in multicore performance.

>on an Android with raw processing power alone. The new M1 Mac's have processing power faster than i9s for the price of 1000. That's a super good deal.

Again, you don't know what you are talking about. Which i9 are you comparing it to? You do realize that there are i7s  that can outperform i9s or M1s right? There are AMD Ryzen mobile chipsets that can as well.  Not to mention that the M1 is only faster IN CERTAIN TASKS, not faster overall.


>Just have a look at benchmarks, Apple hardware is lightyears ahead of the competition.

I have seen the benchmarks. Their CPU didn't come close to the comparable AMD chipsets.

>
I already know what you're gonna say but no, Intel CPUs are NOT Apple hardware.

What the fuck are you on about?  Are you illiterate?


Microsoft got in trouble for trying to make it so that if you removed IE from Windows, Windows would break.  They then used IE to implement Windows-specific Active X calls on the web, so that you had entire sections of the World Wide Web stuck behind notices saying "This site only works on Microsoft Windows."  So, nah, not even close to the crap that Microsoft made its fortune off of.


Windows was a monopoly with at one point ~ 95% of the market.

iPhone has 17% market share worldwide and 52% in US.

The two situations aren't remotely comparable.


That’s not what the microsoft anti-trust suit was about.


Based only on their mobile app, the library has  really terrible organization, and adding songs to it is extremely unintuitive. Liking a song only adds it to your “liked songs” playlist, so you won’t see it in the albums  or the artists tab. The only way to view an artist in the artist tab is to follow the artist. However, when you select a followed artist, instead of showing you songs you liked from that artist, it just takes you to the artists’ Spotify page, which has its own host of issues. The only way to view an album in the albums tab is to like the ENTIRE album, which you may not want to do. At least they finally put a search into the library. 

But even so, if you want to find a specific song you liked a year and a half ago, you can’t just search your library. You have to search your liked songs playlist. When you play that one song, it will just play thru the search results, instead of just starting the playlist from that one song.

I can see how people who curate their music with playlists might like this, as the interface seems heavily geared towards playlists and the sharing thereof. However, as someone who wants meta-data to do all the sorting for me, which Apple Music, and iTunes before it, does, Spotify is a massive headache to deal with.


Spotify is getting lyrics btw. In fact, I have lyrics access but that’s because I live in one of the available countries


Oh yeah definitely. I wouldn’t base my purchase off that. I use to use android heavily but it was just easier to get an iPhone for me. Family uses an iPhone, friends as well so it just made sense

Apple just announced lossless and spatial audio coming to apple music for no additional price


you can enjoy your ALAC files, was just announced


Third option is to route your console audio to pc and have both pc audio and console audio going out through one pair of headphones. Which sounds like a lot but is really simple, only issue is you have your pc on just for that.

Native support would be much better tho.


My mistake! I forgot your opinion was the only viable one, won’t do that again!


RDR2 has a budget of around 200M, TLOU was around 100M, there have been rumors about Halo Infinite having a 500M budget but I doubt that. Plus the gameplay we’ve seen so far doesn’t represent something you’d expect from a 500M dollar game.

Yes dude. It was painfully clear it was a joke


I think he said it didnt do well by happenstance (luck or chance) it took a lot of hard work to recover from the losses of PS3 and a lot of strategic investments of PS4 that paid off (1st party content). So just because someone buy PS doesnt mean continued success is guaranteed.


I didn't say PS4 didn't do well for Sony. Quite the opposite. They worked hard for the PS4 to be a success. Their default state isn't just success. Apple couldn't just be lazy and expect everything to go great.

Facebook and Google pretty much all their money entirely off selling ads right


Thats market cap, that’s not cash or assets that they have on hand. It has more to do with investor confidence than the size of the company, although they’re typically correlated.


For Apple Users it’s better as it’s baked into the OS natively. Not sure how AM on Android works with Airplay but you’re probably right that Connect would be be better on non-Apple devices.


From the current AMD mobile chips only the high end 4800/5800 outperform the M1 in multicore, but in single core the M1 is still faster. And let me remind you the M1 is the entry level chip that you can get in a Mac mini for $700. For a device with the 5800 you have to pay much more. New M1x chip is coming very soon with double the performance cores. You said something about Apple being overpriced for its performance?

The Intel devices had heat issues but that is no longer the case with M1 models.

Btw the CPU in the PS5 is slightly weaker than a 3700x. The 3700x benchmarks about 1250 single core / 8450 multicore in Geekbench 5. Since the PS5 is clocked lower than the PC equivalent, it will be lower than that. The M1 scores 1750/7700. The entry level  ultralight MacBook has literally the CPU power equivalent to the PS5.


>	Their CPU didn't come close to the comparable AMD chipsets.

>	 Are you illiterate?

Lmao.


Also Microsoft told the OEMs e.g. Compaq, Dell etc that if were to pre-install and promote Netscape they would revoke their license to sell Windows.


Honestly its the boat im in right now. Thinking about getting an apple device as my main driver but I kinda want to see if I would actually use it since the last time I had one I just didn't have a bunch of apple stuff. I have a decent amount now though.

Seeing as there’s no other comparable solutions available on the PS5, it’s actually more fact than opinion unfortunately.


Why did you try to use a bug you encountered as factual evidence to it not being the best way, but then tried to backpedal to it being a discussion of opinions?


Halo Infinite’s rumored budget included marketing. Given that Halo 2 had an 80 million dollar marketing budget in 2004 and 15 years of inflation, it’s pretty easy to think that they’re spending $250 million+ on marketing.


Exactly, $3.23B Profits for PlayStation thanks to their first party line up during FY20 (TLOU Part II, Ghost of Tsushima, Miles Morales...) and boost from stay at home demand due to lockdowns/pandemic

It could have been way higher if Sony didn’t sell PS5 at loss but that’s a long term strategy


But that's all revenue, what's the biggest profit?


thank you for making me understand your point of view  and I am sorry for misunderstanding your previous comment


Yes he was talking about consoles, he literally mentions that gaming isn’t apple’s thing, of course he is. And windows is Microsoft’s main product, as far as I know Xbox or the surface tablets aren’t exactly pumping a lot of money into them.


Im not sure why you’re experience is different, but I’m fully in the apple system and even use HomePods, but AirPlay doesn’t have anywhere near the same ease of use as Spotify connect


That's right, don't bring facts, just laugh because you don't even have one functioning brain cell.


Because I don’t care enough about being right to continue? 🤷‍♂️


250M+ on marketing huh? You know I can believe that. But I personally don’t count marketing towards game development costs. In terms of actual dev costs, Halo Infinite is probably 100M+.


If you think operating income is the same as revenue, then I don't know what to tell you.


>Yes he was talking about consoles

He literally replied to you saying he was talking about financials.

>And windows is Microsoft’s main product

I just go into the control center, long press on music in the upper right corner, and click the “control other speakers and TVs” button. From there you can easily control every Airplay device on your network.

Or you can go in to the music or podcasts app and click the weird triple circle button and control what device you send your music or podcast to.

Reading some of these comments I feel like a lot of people seem to be confusing thunderbolt with lightning port lol.


I knew Thunderbolt's migration to USB-C was going to confuse everybody and there's total evidence of that here in the comments. So here's a quick breakdown:

Intel created Thunderbolt to get the performance of PCIe slots to external devices. USB was too slow and firewire was dying, if not dead already. Intel created the standard, but instead of creating a whole new cable, they used an existing one. They initially wanted to use USB, but it was disallowed, so they went with Mini DisplayPort. That lasted for Thunderbolt version 1 & 2.

Thunderbolt 3 came out and they migrated over to USB-C, ditching DisplayPort. Right now, the only practical way of telling the different between USB-C and Thunderbolt is the little Lightning Bolt Logo next to the USB-C Port. (Edit: [This logo specifically.](https://i.imgur.com/svsRP1Q.jpg) apparently HP decided to use a similar lightning logo for non-Thunderbolt, USB-C always charging ports too, smh.)

If you haven't used a Thunderbolt device before, this can all be very confusing. Just understand that there are two different standards using USB-C ports, almost like when USB 2.0 came out and we still had 1.1 devices. But there is hope in the future! USB 4 will be utilizing Thunderbolt 3's standards, so future USB-C ports will all be the same high speed connections and compatible with Thunderbolt 3 devices... 

at least until Thunderbolt 4 devices start coming out.


I'm not an Apple user, so don't understand the hype about this. Doesn't it already have USB-C which is pretty much the standard these days?


For who are asking. Usb C is the conector, just cables. 
Now the electronic hardware that makes possible the connection to the cpu, it can be usb 2.0, 3.0, etc. This this thunderbolt; the difference is that it will open the possibility, given the much more power support and data transfer, of using a monitor, mouse, charge, etc all in just one port as modern MacBooks do


This is fantastic! It looks like Apple are going to blur the line between iPad and Macbook with Thunderbolt, ARM, and possibly cross-platform apps. But it is a pity that they will not even give iPhone a plain USB-C port.


I suppose you can connect external hdd and monitor. May be an eGpu?


If it could run macOS I‘d instantly buy it, without it it is a super powerful mobile device that could theoretically do so much, but in the end is just used to.. surf the internet? All that power feels so pointless at the moment.


Cheap to implement, easy to mark up 200%. Pointless for the consumer.


Does that make a difference? It already has a USB-C.

Edit:
Im saying does thunderbolt3 provide any Practical benefit over usbC? What can thunderbolt do at 40gbps that usbC can’t do at 20gbps that will make the iPad more like a Mac?


“Arming” is an odd choice of words for that title. Makes it sound like the product is going to stab me if I don’t install Apple Music


Thunderbolt is capable of eGPU meaning it has one of the highest BANDWIDTH and supports very high external resolution. It’s pretty much external PCIe. Thunderbolt protocol is ”closer” to CPU than USB which cuts down latency. When TB first came to be it was a moderate big thing in audio as it really cut down the roundtrip latency (yes, RTL depends on many factors). TB has the potential to be all-in-one solution (data transfer, streaming video in/out, power cable) with it’s daisy chaining possibilities but as of no it’s a bit underutilised+USB works for most consumer applications.

Also clarification: TB3 uses same connector as USB-C. When TB3 came to existence, there was Windows laptops with lightning marked USB-C ports meaning they are TB3-enabled. It was pretty confusing for starters as vendors weren’t so clear when the device had USB-C w/TB3 and when just regular fast USB-C 3.1


Who are they even competing with anymore for the phrase "arming" to even be relevant? People are gonna buy the iPad whether or not it has a lightning port or a thunderbolt. Just saying.


*Article* “ Same port shape as USBC just faster and faster charging.”
*Commenters* “y are they always changing port shape duuuurrrrrrrr”


Imagine Candy Crush with a eGPU. Ray Traced candy.


Makes no sense unless it's capable of running or dual booting Mac OS.


This title makes me feel threatened


Arming? Will it shoot out lightening bolts and make rumbling thunder sounds?


So the Thunderbolt port is USB-C but faster.  It looks like the same port shape and size as USB-C, so is it able to connect with either kind of cord?  USB-C or Thunderbolt, just that if you use a thunderbolt cord, then it will be a faster connection?  If that's the case, then this is finally a unique Apple port I can finally get behind because it's both proprietary to enable faster connections, but also compatible with the cord that everyone else has at the same time, at least that is if it works that way.


I swear, if the next iPhone is still lightning I’m going to pee my pants. Sick of all these random charging cords


from the good old classic trapezoid micro usb, to a more modern trapezoid micro usb, to some weird lightning thingamagic for overpriced stuff... to a new, faster, better, and flexible-er thunderbolt whateverthename cable. if thats not evolution chargey-wirey edition, then nothing is.


I fucking love all of you simpletons that agree with me that they have fucked over “innovation” but then flock to upgrade. Remember a boycott? Fuck apple and their fucking dongles. Ima raise my donger for this one. 🖕

I thought last year's iPad Pros already had Thunderbolt instead of Lightning? Maybe they had USB-C but not Thunderbolt?


I have started just putting Ubuntu on my old Mac’s rather than replacing them when the OS abandons them.   

Made me really question the value of Mac computers.  

When I started with them, they were completely integrated with the iPads and the iLife software.   It was actually really cool.  

I could edit and rate pictures on my iPad and the modified pictures (stored on my iMac not with me paying rent to see them on the iCloud) would show up the screensavers around the house on computers and Apple TV’s. 

It all just sucks now.  

They abandoned every bit of that, including my tens of thousands of edited and curated pictures in Aperture. 

They are just slow computers with Messages.


Do they have to pay Intel to implement?

~~This is dumb speculation. Thunderbolt is an Intel trademark.~~

~~Guess who's not using Intel for literally anything anymore? Apple.~~

~~It will likely have 20Gbps throughput, not "Thunderbolt."~~

Edit: I'm mistaken. I do believe 20Gbps will replace TB as a protocol, being more open source and not requiring a TB handshake, though for now it seems Apple will continue to license TB as a protocol.


I couldn't give a fuck until it has a full desktop OS. 

Call me when I need to care.


It's so weird that Apple ditched Intel silicon but it's still using proprietary Intel standards like Thunderbolt.


Thunderbolt is usb c right?


Yay, the anti consumer and anti competition company is doing something so that charge even more for their products that they've made impossible to repair. Woot, more e-waste


Is there a more innovative company than apple right now?


[deleted]


Will iPhone ever get USB-C, or are they going to milk money out of proprietary charger sales forever?


Wasn’t thunderbolt just like a mini display port? What is this thunderbolt port? Where have I been?


Can they make the biggest IPad Pro the world’s ever seen too?

Edit: to the guy who downvoted me, I’m so sorry I want a bigger iPad


How generous of our benevolent Apple.


I thought the iphone 13 was supposed to get rid of all ports for wireless charging & gadgets. Weird they would put a thunderbolt port on an ipad.


Doesn’t it already have a Type-C thunderbolt?


Makes me believe they don't intend USB C port for other than ipads and macs


Apple.... *adding* ports?

What is the current temperature of hell?


Apple will next be renaming USB-C to firework port


It already has it


Thanks. Hate having to use AirPods on this shit. They constantly stop


Thunderbolt is code name for fleshlight? (Foreign accent - foreign to your accent sounding)


Lame


What I want to know is why apple changes the port every time


Apples features are so lame, look you can charge it!


[deleted]


They're also confused with the difference between usb-c and thunderbolt


Thunderbolt is ok, but I'm holding off for the Firebolt. Until then I'm sticking with my Nimbus.


So i can gas up my A-10 Thunderbolt with this pig?


I'm more amused by people thinking it's a new port and Apple "made up" a new name for a port.


Because the people who invented these ports gave them dumb names.

No be here for Thunder. I can see if you have exclusive Apple stuff. Once this gets released it gives me the chance to buy the latest Air for a discount 👍


God damn it’s the DnD thunder damage vs Lightning Damage type all over again


NGL, that was my first thought — “waitwhat, No way, they only just went to usbc”.

Then I realized the relationship between tb3, tb4, usbc 3.2 and usbc 4, and it made more sense.


its almost like they shouldn't have named it thunderbolt when their previous charger was called lightning


Isn't thunderbolt the media port, like the one I used on on MacBook in 2012 to plug it into a projector?


I always wondered why they didn’t use a specific colour as a standard to differentiate usb-c from thunderbolt. Like the standard blue for the usb 3.0.


I appreciate this breakdown. I was very confused as to why thunderbolt would be the port of choice since it is much bigger than USB-C, but I had not realized they moved over to a newer style port/connector. 

Honestly they probably should have just renamed it because that is going to confuse a lot of the old timers and make things even more stupid for AV techs.


Some correction:

TB 4 is the literal same performance and specs as 3, but with better worst case scenario performance.

USB 4 is a mess of a standard that includes what was originally  3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbs, now  USB4 Gen 2×1 ), 3.2 Gen\*2 (20 Gbs   USB4 Gen 2×2) , and Thunderbolt 3 (40 GB, now  USB4 Gen 3×2 ) and a new 20 GB single lane version (USB4 Gen 3×1).

I'm pretty sure the two 20 Gbs versions can only communicate with each other at 10 Gbs, which is EXTRA stupid.


Thunderbolt 4 is just a stricter version of thunderbolt 3. MacBook pros thunderbolt 3 is equivalent to thunderbolt 4 specs.


Isn’t the lightening bolt next to the port basically saying ‘you can power your device from here even if I’m turned off’?


TIL...a lot.  Thank you for this explanation.


Thank you for being smart so I don’t have to be


Thank you for this. Can we just put you in charge of making apple and samsung commit to a joint effort towards universal ports already? Yeesh


USB-C and Thunderbolt share the same port, but Thunderbolt uses a different standard, allowing it greater utility. 

The big take away here is that Thunderbolt uses PCIe bus, which allows data transfer speeds of 40/Gbps to USB-C’s 10/Gbps. This additional speed allows it to run two 4K monitors to C’s one, and the more beneficial to some, you can run external hardware through Thunderbolt like a GPU.

So same form factor, different standardization. Think DVD vs BluRay - same size disk, but the underlying tech made Blu-ray better and eventually allowed it to become the ‘dominant’ standard, which is sort of the goal - they’re vying for the universal presence that USB has had for the past decade.

The standards all fall under the purveyance of the IEEE, if you’re and autodidact they are a great resource for all things electrical; internet interests would fall under the IETF/ISOC.


even as an apple user i’m a little confused. i guess it’ll be faster for data transfer?


Thunderbolt is also a USB-C port but in Thunderbolt mode you can have higher speeds.


Same port but faster. So you would be able to use usb-c cables but still have the ability to use insanely fast thunderbolt products... but honestly i dont know if thunderbolt is that much faster to the new usb-c standards


USB-C is the name of the port.

Thunderbolt is a communication protocol.

USB is also a communication protocol.

Thunderbolt > USB

Thunderbolt allows 100W of power delivery.
Thunderbolt is twice as fast as USB.
Thunderbolt devices can be daisy chained.
Thunderbolt allows for multiple displays to attached using the DisplayPort protocol in addition to the display link protocol.

That’s all you need to know.


Intel must be really blowing through their marketing budget right now because I keep seeing these obnoxious Thunderbolt shill articles all over the place recently. They're even straight up lying (like this one claiming it can charge faster -- fast power delivery is part of the USB standard and the best Thunderbolt ports can do is support that) to try to convince people that "good" USB ports are now called Thunderbolt ports. It's horseshit. For 99% of all people this thing will only ever act as a USB port which is plenty fast for all the normal things you'd want to do with a tablet.

It's good that Apple keeps moving more products to USB-C now and it's a great standard in general, I just can't stand Intel trying so hard to get their patent-encrusted shit in there for no reason other than good old unbridled corporate greed.

Ah. I work in technology and a long time max user and even I didn’t make that connection. Thank you


Super not fun fact: not all “USB-C” cables are also “Thunderbolt 3” cables. Different cables with the exact same ends are incompatible and won’t carry higher amperage power or thunderbolt 3 data rates. Some ports or cables are even miswired like the Raspberry Pi 4 launch debacle. This miswiring could even cause a fire, yay!

As I’ve experienced personally, some will even cause a power short and fry something if you try to use the “wrong” cable for thunderbolt peer to peer networking. What a wonderful “standard” the USB-IF have created.


Unless they are gonna extend the display it’s pointless to just mirror, we already can connect mouse and keyboards so not so much wow factor yet.


Instead of using a charger, a wired usb-a mouse and a pair of wired headphones connected to different port, you'll need to buy and use 23 different dongle, 54 different charging cable and 3 completely different (port, "model" and obviously price) charging brick if you want to work with your new computer/tablet


USB-C already has alternate HDMI mode. USB-C docks with video outs work wonderfully with phones like Galaxy S20 and so on. Laptops without Thunderbolt work with docks exactly how you said. Everything works without the need of Thunderbolt

The only real use of Thunderbolt I may see is connecting external M.2 HDDs and GPUs and maybe some super-specific network connectors (pro level stuff). Maybe some other special accessories that really matter for less than 0.1% of the end users. And those use other equipment as well 

Also, it is a HUGE confusion regarding the way video works because USB-C supports HDMI in at least 3 ways:

1. As an alternate mode of USB C

2. Through DisplayPort in alternate mode adapted to HDMI

3. Through Thunderbolt (that may support both HDMI and DP)

As for why Apple is including it on iPads, I think they do this to make them compatible with already existing external HDDs and other accessories 

Heck, I think that maybe they will make something like a Mac to iPad connection thing so they will be connected via pci-e. IDK for what but it sounds too cool to dismiss 😎


I guess those who are asking have not payed any attention to Macbooks for the last 5 years


I don’t see how thunderbolt helps much here. It already had usbC which is more than capable enough

Edit: I’m not saying USBC and TB are the same thing.  I’m saying USBC isn’t exactly holding the iPad back in terms of making it more like a Mac. Better software is what it needs , the USBC isn’t the bottleneck here.


Cross platform apps already exist. iOS apps can be built to m1 macs.


Yea it’s annoying but I don’t completely get all the fuss about it. Like I already have enough lightning cables lying around it’s not like it would improve/change anything besides being able to use the same cable.


Doesn’t the iPad have this port already? I’m confused.. mine connects to USB c already?


You can do it now with the current iPad and the USB-C connector. Not for the eGPU although since it’s not currently supported on the M1 Macs, I don’t think that it would be supported on a supposedly Thunderbolt equipped iPad.


The hardware has been capable enough for several years now. The software is just too cumbersome to do most tasks. It's just easier and faster on a laptop, and considering you can get the amazing M1 MacBook for cheaper than a base iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, this device just doesn't make sense. Either allow it to run MacOS and iOS and switch between, or keep it.on iOS and slash the prices in half and get rid of the mid level air model.


Yep I’ve been wanting a tablet that runs OSX since the iPad was first launched. 

Is that such a niche ask that Apple won’t consider it? Basically an Apple Version of the Surface? 

iPadOS is just too locked down for what I do at work. There are programs I use that will never be available on a mobile App Store.


Although you do have a point it’s relative to the user because to someone in the creative industry, for example, it’s a very useful tool that’s able to do a lot more and speed up workflow rather than a thing just for surfing the internet


Don't forget the 500% markup for more storage.


If Apple really cared about the consumer,  they would have put a USB-C port in their phones along with the iPad like a couple of generations ago like everyone else in the smartphone field. But that would cut into their cable and dongles profit so they are just going to keep going with that stupid lightning port for several more years until everyone in America has bought a USB-C to lightning cable befit finally announcing a "revolutionary integration" of USB-C to the iPhone!


*Apple*


Useless ? Maybe you think so but it does have lots of usages that are not covered by usb.


Faster transfer speeds


Usb c is just the shape.


they need a list of shit they changed to justify the price!!


Multiple devices hooked up at same time, such as monitors with high refresh rate, m.2 ssds, recording devices.

You can do this on usb-c but performance will be hindered significantly.


It sounds like an Apple press release packet.


It will


In the past that was correct. But now with USB4 Thunderbolt has just become a catchy name for something that is completely integrated in the USB4 standard.


Sure it does. Better IO support. Docks, other monitors, etc. I agree that dual boot etc would make MORE sense, but a swap to thunderbolt definitely has benefits.


It’s not necessarily a unique Apple port or a new thing. Macs have been equipped with these types of ports since 2016 and thunderbolt is an Intel technology. It’ll play nice with other devices that utilizes thunderbolt


Why have you plagiarised my comment?


The iPad Pro already has 120 Hz refresh rate since 2017 I think.

And I don’t think battery life will change that drastically since the M1 are not as much more efficient than the current iPad chips as compared to intel chips.


And yet because of the software it will still be harder to get work done on it than an M1 MacBook Air. The iPad has a very small niche when it comes to actually getting work done on it. Sure as a consumption device it's great, and for digital art it is top notch.


I have an iPad Pro 2018 and still think it’s the best choice for your money.


Home sharing is still there. You just have to turn it on. 

iCloud is a significant upgrade on that functionality though.


Does the OS abandon them too soon?  I have a 2012 iMac that seems to be fine.  My 2009 MacBook Pro is no longer useful but that hardware is pretty well shot too - definitely got my money's worth out of those two, along with my 2015 MBP which is still my primary machine.


> abandoned every bit of that

Have they? We have Apple TV’s (one 4th Gen, one 4K), the last Intel iMac, two iPhone 12 Pro Max’s, the last iPad mini, and a mid-2014 MacBook Pro that all do exactly what you described. They all talk to each other and share as I would expect.

Maybe the difference is that I am using iCloud but I don’t see it as rent so much as a service that gives me access to everything out of the home. I do have a (non-Apple) NAS but iCloud is a lot more reliable than sucking things through my cable modem.


No, Thunderbolt is royalty free to implement.


I do not think Intel charge royalties anymore (somebody correct me if I am wrong). Intel usually sell the Thunderbolt controllers, but since Apple built the circuitry into their own chip, that does not apply, either. They may have paid a once-off fee to an Intel-sanctioned laboratory to get their product certified to be allowed to use the Thunderbolt branding, though.


Lol its been ages they can’t put a simple calculator and keep updating the freaking port.


Apple is still using intel. They produce many intel laptops currently.


That's because apple helped develop the thunderbolt protocol. They have as much right to use it as Intel.


They use the same connector


Thunderbolt uses USB C. This change doesn’t in any way change repairability or e-waste.

Your post only makes sense if you don’t know that Thunderbolt goes through USB C.


You have no idea what you're talking about do you. Apple is not anti-consumer


[removed]


Is that a joke?


I'm honestly surprised they still make ipads haven't heard anyone talk about them since like 2013.


Apple does not sell proprietary chargers, any USB-C charger will work.


13 is probably a little too early, maybe 14.


No, it had a USB-C port but it’s USB 3.x as the protocol. Thunderbolt is a faster protocol with more versatility.


Thunderbolt is usb-c compatible


Same USB-C port, upgraded data transfer speeds.


Galileo!


More like: recommended pricing, very very frightening


I came here looking for this and per usual am not disappointed.


That's understandable at least.


Isn't everyone?


Uhhh what’s the difference


I saw the the pic and was like "it's a USB-C"


Heheh plane go bbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttt


Thunderbolt Grease-Slapper!


So, it's definitely not a new name for a port, but Apple totally did ["make up" the name for the port when they re-branded it from Light Peak.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_\(interface\))


Thunderbolt is Intel’s and it’s not exclusive to Apple platforms. Windows laptop makers even build thunderbolt ports


Stoked for Thunderbolt. That means way better support to use as a second display with faster refresh rates.


You do realize Thunderbolt was made by Intel right? And also older than lightning?


:facepalm


Thunderbolt 1 and 2 look like Mini DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3 and 4 look like USB C. It was originally an Intel and Apple thing, but companies making normal PCs like Dell have swapped to using Thunderbolt on a lot of laptops. This allowed them to eliminate the bulky, non-standard dock connections on the bottom of laptops. Consumers are just expected to connect one or two cables and be done.

They are capable of anything USB C (3 or 4) can do, and more. You can daisy chain multiple monitors on the one port, connect a dock for full IO (network, displays, USB, mic/speaker) and power delivery well, all through one cable. You can even use an external GPU enclosure with a brand new card and get a decent experience (if you can find a GPU worth owning these days).

Razer laptops use this for their external GPU (eGPU), and have for many years, to offer thin and light portables that are also heavily marketed for gaming.

Since it's basically just a better version of USB C (USB 3/4), with back compatibility, the only deterrent from every connector being Thunderbolt is price.


But blue is only required on the device if not all ports are USB3. Apple has had USB3 on previous laptops and they were black because every port was USB3.


Thunderbolt 3 is like, at least 6 years old. No need to rename it.


Mostly. They *must* have at least 1 port available for charging the laptop now where it was an option on TB3, but data transfer requirements are higher. 32 Gb/s vs 16, which is essential to be able to push out to 2 - 4K displays vs 1 - 4K display.


Not necessarily. The lightning bolt only means that it is a thunderbolt port and it capabilities/options can vary at the manufacturers discretion. For example, you might be able to charge your laptop using a compatible power adapter, or a connected dock can tell your laptop to power on/off via that port. Or you could simply have none of that and it's just a faster port. It really is all over the place unfortunately.

Thunderbolt 4 will be cleaning up some of these variabilities, as well as increasing throughout to be able to push out 2 - 4K displays.


I’m not sure that’s standardized. Some devices have a little battery, or a battery with a thunderbolt in it, as the power-even-when-device-is-off port.


Thunderbolt does not have to use all PCIe lanes given in the specification. 

The current Apple Silicon Mac's can't use external GPU enclosures, and can only have two displays total, so for the MacBooks that's one external display only. For the Mac mini that's two. 

It's highly likely that the Thunderbolt port on the iPad Pro will just be for fast data transfers, not for multi monitor out, or for anything like a GPU enclosure. 

At least not yet. I do feel the line between iOS and macOS is blurring, but it'll take some time before we get absolute feature parity.


You seem to be mixing up USB 3 et al and USB-C. C is just a port.


Does this mean that I can plug in any usb-c cord/Device using the thunderbolt port and it will work, just not as fast?

Or does this mean that it will only work with other thunderbolt crap?


Three cheers for IEEE!


>BluRay became the standard because the porn industry and PS4.


not only faster data transfer but also more versatility (i e io docks). seems to fit into what they see in the ipad (a laptop replacement, which in my eyes it isn't, but a handheld with the capabilities of a weak workstation instead)


The current iPad pro 12.9 has a USB C 3.1. I believe that's limited to only a single 4k@60Hz. With a TB3 port, you could use QHD+ high refresh displays, super-wide 1440p at high refresh rates, 4k@120Hz, AND use the peripheral ports. 
 
So that s doesn't mean a lot to the average customer, but to some who uses it as their main computer (WhAtS a CoMpUtEr?) this would make the iPad pro a real laptop replacement. I use a cloud PC with a Tab S7+ at home and a USB C dock. If I want to game with a high refresh display, I'm stuck with my tablet's display, rather than connecting it to my 27" 1440p 100Hz display. If the S7+ had a TB3 port (and I was using a TB3 dock), I wouldn't have any issues.


Thunderbolt is compatible with USB-C, it is different from lightning (the port on the iPhones)


Apple + convenience and sense? Right, and I’m Homer Simpson. I’m tired of just barely being given enough to convince me to make a purchase for something with “eh” level of improvement.


You also need a special thunderbolt cable. Any plain old type-C won’t work.


Slight correction. You can use USB-C cables for USB-C devices, not for Thunderbolt devices. 

The cable spec is different. Thunderbolt cables will work for USB-C devices, but not necessarily the other way around. 

We started with Thunderbolt docks at work and quickly switched to USB-C docks after the first batch. The advantages of Thunderbolt over USB-C were not there for the vast majority of our use cases. So it was not worth the extra cost.


The main limitations I find on USB-C is driving multiple monitors. You usually get limited to one monitor. You can sometimes drive 2 at lower resolution or refresh rate.

Thunderbolt is a great docking solution which I assume is the main plan..I can't see external GPUs and other peripherals being the target.

Thunderbolt is an optional part of the USB 4 spec now so it makes sense to use it.


Nice!  I'm gonna play PS5 instead of going to school today and if my mama gets mad I'm gonna tell her Coldasthepoles already taught me everything I need to know!


> Thunderbolt allows 100W of power delivery. 

Not necessarily. There are gaming laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports that don't allow for charging. Thunderbolt 4 enforces having USB-Power Delivery but it's unlikely that Apple will be using Thunderbolt 4 in the future.

 > Thunderbolt is twice as fast as USB. 

Again, not necessarily. A USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 port can be as fast as some Thunderbolt 3 ports that only have access to 2 PCIe lanes (see: Dell XPS 15 9560) at 20Gbps. USB 4 ports are supposed to have speeds of up to 40Gbps, the same as Thunderbolt 3 and 4.


> I just can't stand Intel trying so hard to get their patent-encrusted shit in there for no reason other than good old unbridled corporate greed.

Apple is a co-creator of Thunderbolt. And, it leveraged some some technologies from Firewire. Moreover, as of Thunderbolt 3, it is royalty free.


USB-C is neither fast nor slow. It's a physical port specification over which you can run Thunderbolt, USB 3.1, displays, and so on.


Ok so it's faster, but the flash storage in the ipad isn't going to be faster than 10Gbps anyway. You're not going to read or write faster than your storage media. And most people IF they have an ssd it's probably still a sata one capped at 4Gbps.


[deleted]


Simultaneously not. Considering then maybe there will be only one port it’s very interesting having thunderbolt, specially for professionals


For artists, mirroring allows for the use of apps meant for use on a computer, which can be great if you already spent 80-160$ on an application such as ClipStudio and can’t extend the license to the iPad app. Basically, allows the iPad to be a pen tablet like Wacom or Cintiq.


Usbc is the port type, it was still limited by usb 3.1 gen 2 (10 gbps). TB can get up to 40gbps, so can connect more monitors, transfer faster, etc. 

Most people won’t make use of this, but it’ll be a nice upgrade for some.

Support native resolutions for 5K and 6K monitors perhaps? There’s a market for photographers, designers and video editors for mobile work and client applications.


I think we should take this as a sign that, hopefully, apple has some big plans to make the iPad an increasingly capable work machine. 

As you alluded to they can do a lot with the stuff hardware they already have and i really think the operating system is generally the limiting factor now.


Now that their Macbooks are ARM-based, Apple is likely going to capitalise on the ability to use the same SoC design in both their Macbooks and iPads. The Macbook SoC now has Thunderbolt built-in, and that SoC was probably adapted from the iPad SoC. At some point they are probably like "these two have so few differences that they are basically the same design now". So it's more a matter of "why not", than "why".


Yeah and they can also go to tvOS and watchOS. Problem is each OS basically has its own version and not a lot of code is reusable between any two aside from iPad and iPhone.


That is my main problem: the same cable. If you don't have to carry 5 cables, but only one that is a massive improvement. If every phone is charged with the same cable you can always ask a friend to use their charger and not be disappointed because they use another one


The current models have either USB-C or legacy lightning for the lower priced models (IIRC - all our iPads are still going strong, so I don’t watch the market.)  Thunderbolt 3 uses the same connector as USB-C, so users can  continue to use USB-C peripherals but also make use of Thunderbolt.


The existing iPad USB C is standard, Apple also have a variant using the same USB C type connector which has additional features they've called Thunderbolt 3.  It is already used in more recent Mac's.

Thunderbolt 3 works with all USB C devices but Thuderbolt 3 peripherals do not work on USB C.


Given how many students I know who use Surfaces because they are so handy, but who would probably prefer an Apple device because they prefer the ecosystem/brand, it likely wouldn't be a niche at all


Not an expert but a macOS tablet would cannibalize macbooks imo. I’ve had an iphone + macbook for 2 years and i ended up buying an ipad air last week with the pencil, because all three products can do something the other two can’t. Somewhat genius marketing that manages to do some significant damage to my wallet


I actually do work in the creative industry and its often very much lacking compared to macOS.
For example, I‘d like to tether images from a camera via capture one. Afaik there is no software which can do that on an iPad. Then I would like to export a set of images, batch rename them, zip them and send the zip via email. Even the renaming and zipping part was so complicated on an iPad last time I tried.

All in all thats a pretty basic thing to do for a creative job (with or without the tethering part)

All that is no problem at all on a couple years old macbook, but almost not possible on a 10x faster iPad.


Glued in and potted over to make it unserviceable!


> Don't forget the 500% markup for more storage.

Thunderbolt storage is insane.


iPhones will never have USB-C ports, port-less is the next step.


Apple’s end-game is to introduce a port-less smartphone within the next couple of years. They’ve been allegedly prototyping usb-c for a while now but decided it wasn’t worth forcing users to adjust to the brief period before dropping ports altogether


Go ahead and list off some of them, I'll wait.


Pft. Name them.


Isn't USB C 3.2 Gen 2 already 20 Gbps though?  I mean technology is meant to go up, up and up but in this case I'm surprised they would add something that goes beyond that.

*Edit* looked up USB 4.0, which is equal to Thunderbolt and it's 40gbps.  Fast.  Do any devices actually take advantage of that, that would be connected to a tablet?  External graphics card?  Special purpose dock?


Which is such a moot selling point lol
 


I dont think ive ever hooked a wire tonmy phone to transfer anything lol.


Who transfers data from their iPad to another device via the port? Don’t people just use the internet? Or Airdrop?


It’s more that it’s become a guaranteed set of features, whereas USB4 has a number of optional functions that can be included or not by the manufacturer. 

So for example USB4 is *capable* of outputting, say 2x4K, but any device with a Thunderbolt implementation is *required* to have that capability.


iPad OS can't do anything worthwhile to make use of TB that can't otherwise be done with the current Type C port.


Of course, I have an ipad air ( not the new one) so for me the 120hz will be new to me.


Better support than Windows


That’s where we differ. I see that as them charging me $15 a month rent to see my own pictures that I could, and did, store on my own computer.


And I did it happily. I'll die on this hill


Lol yes of course


They're very huge on the tablet scene, especially in universities...

Android tablets are kind of useless, the only competition are the full Windows OS tablets (which have big drawbacks in terms of battery life, touch support and performance... but for many the full desktop OS is a big advantage).


I’m referring to the lightning cables used for iPhones.

Lol I sang this comment as I read it, why is it so funny haha!


No


TLDR you can think of the thunderbolt 3 as a better version of USBC. They’re physically the same size but thunderbolt can support much more functions


USB-C is a physical connector, Thunderbolt is a protocol. Some USB-C connectors can do Thunderbolt-3, some only USB 3, some only USB-2, some that can only do USB can also do DisplayPort, and so on. It's more complicated than it should be.


Apple didn’t rebrand it, light peak was simply the code name and thunderbolt was intel’s commercial name.


There's a even a couple amd motherboards with thunderbolt.


My dell laptop has a thunderbolt port.


Yeah but this is Reddit you have to circlejerk over Apple and the ports anytime an Apple device is mentioned


Technically not true, Thunderbolt is now openly available technology, although I think there is some weird certification process that has to go through Intel.


To be fair, they’re pretty forgettable. I didn’t have a use for the thunderbolt ports on my thinkpad until I got an iPhone 11. Having an extra USB port essentially dedicated to charging my phone made all the difference.


Tch tch. No. Lightning comes first. Then the thunder.


Good points, but I'm sure they meant "like", not "exactly the same as"

It's the standards body after all, they can make the standard require whatever they want


*dual 4K @ 60Hz (IIRC)


Both my laptops have a lightning bolt icon, neither have thunderbolt


I feel like thunderbolt speeds on the iPad Pro is mostly useless. Apple has made it nearly impossible to transfer files from a computer to an iPad/iPhone with a wired connection. 

If I have a 6GB 4K video on my MacBook that I want to send to my iPad photos app, what options do I have?  
  I could connect them with a USB-C cable and transfer the files, right? That would take barely a minute. 

No.  
There is no way to transfer that video with a cable. I have to either use AirDrop, which is slower and usually fails for large files. Or I can upload the 6GB video to iCloud or Google Drive using my 12mbps upload speeds from Comcast, then download it onto my iPad. 

Or lastly, I could connect a USB-C dock to my Mac and copy the file to an SD card (which have major speed limitations), and then connect that same dock to my iPad and import the video through the photos app. 

So besides external monitors, I cannot think of any realistic use for 40GB/S thunderbolt transfer speeds on the iPad unless Apple is planning on making major changes to how the iPad functions.


If you change USB-C to USB-C/USB 3.1 everywhere in this post, it still works. Some people use USB-C colloquially to refer to USB 3.1. It's not technically correct, but it's common enough that most people understand what is meant.


Usb 3.1 (10gps vs 5gps usb 3.)


Correct, it will work fine as a usb-c cord, but the additional capabilities won’t be usable because the cord is not setup for that use. I believe it’s literally an extra wire or wires within the bundle that change the spec of it.

It’s still usable as intended


Honestly they’re the real MVPs


PS3*


And because it was technically superior in the medium to long term. HD-DVD was always going to have to be supplanted by a new technology, Blu-Ray had a pathway that will likely see it be the last mainstream optical format outside of archives.


iPads are powerful (apparently this new A14X is meant to be as fast as an M1) but the software holds it back like mad. external display support is still limited to mirroring, files app is still very mobile-esque. i could go on but i’m sure plenty of people have done better lists. if only apple would actually let us take advantage of the power...


Yeah. Also, like, I have the latest iPad Pro and an iPhone 12. Therefore, I have to have both USB C to thunderbolt AND my USB C to USB C almost everywhere I go. 

Just fucking choose one apple and go with it and I’ll be happy. But please, PLEASE, stop this both thing you’re torturing us with.


USB c docks exist too, only thing thunderbolt has that I know of is the faster speeds


USB C docks are common , is a thunderbolt dock better somehow?

I've been using usb C docks for years


Whatever you play would have to be able to run consistently at 1440 100fps on the tablet. That would be the limiting factor.


i know what thunderbolt is, i’m confused on the actual use an iPad would have for it...


True. But USB-C cable will work if running in USB mode


Typical apple. Makes ya buy a new goddamn cord after you have 17 in your house


How are you connecting those monitors? I've got 3 running 1080p off a single dock and other than them not picking up every now and then it's pretty stable.

Should add I'm talking about 200 laptops in our office being like this


This is entirely wrong. A simple google should clear that up

Edit: I'm off, see reply


I think it's a pretty safe differentiation tho. All Thunderbolt are USB-C but not all USB-C is Thunderbolt.


It's not just for file transfers that this increase in speed is useful for. You can also use the additional bandwidth for connecting additional external displays or docking.


🔌 hell yeah


There is definitely a use case for mirroring as you described. I use mirroring sometimes but the existing USB C port does this. Thunderbolt wouldn't really create any benefits here that I can see. While its newer tech its good but the limitation is the iPad OS. Its almost like the iPad Pro need its own OS. iPad ProOS


Does that really matter on an iPad? What kind of massive transfer do you see happening on cable? 4k@60hz ~PowerPoint~ inDesign slides? Lmao.


Thunderbolt being able to power more screens is because it carries DisplayPort not because it’s USB 3.2.


But that would mean they'd actually have to fix ipad os. Last time I saw it in action, you could only mirror your screen from the iPad so it would not even use the monitors full resolution. On top of that, most of the apps still weren't optimized for mouse and keyboard support


Plug in a dock


Portable 5k or 6k monitor? I think that's a small market.


Code is highly reusable for the different OS’s now. Especially with Apples SwiftUI lang.


Code is quite reusable even between watchOS and tvOS (especially tvOS). Biggest problem is UI and interaction differences.


I’ve never liked, nor enjoyed, micro-usb. They always seemed so flimsy and directionality is lame. It’s why I absolutely loved the switch to Lightning from the 30pin. Lightning is robust, bidirectional, and I’ve never once had a cable or port failure. 

That said, I’d absolutely prefer communization of USB-C. It’s got all the functional advantages of Lightning, with the bonus of ubiquity. Granted you can find a lightning cable at any dollar store or drug store in the US, that doesn’t help when someone in the office needs to borrow a charge cable and no one has one.


Yea I agree it would be really nice. But on the other I don’t have to carry around 5 cables now with the lightning. My headphones (beats) as well as phone uses lightning. As well as my tablet. So I just need to carry one. 

At some point it would be nice to have the same on everything but I don’t see it that big of a problem right now.


Still confused. If it has USB-C isn't that the same thing as thunderbolt?   


What difference does it make?


Yep, my dad has a surface. If it weren’t for a few Mac specific programs I need to run for work, I would have gotten a Surface or equivalent. In a few years, those Mac specific programs won’t even be supported anymore anyways.


That’s very true- make your users buy them all.


i don’t know why you’re being downvoted, this is all but confirm within the next few iphones


40GB vs 20GB data transfer speeds
ability to power two 60hz 4K monitors with power vs single monitor


Not useless for a tb dock.  

Look at how many usb-c hubs there are that offer multiple usb-c ports. none.

This is because of power delivery and bandwidth.


4x the bandwidth. Kind of up to you what you want to do with it. More and higher resolution displays are a common use. 

Getting 4K out of USB-C is highly dependent on the individual implementation, and often limited to 30Hz. Thunderbolt guarantees at least 4K60.


The main one is a dock. External screen, power, audio, internet, external storage, ...


Nothing can read or write that fast currently, as far as I know, but the point of thunderbolt is that you can daisychain a bunch of devices into one port and all the devices can have ample bandwidth to run on.


It might also support faster charging, more devices on one dock, more displays, more daisychain, etc

Not saying it does but it might be something like that


An nvme m.2 SSD in an external enclosure. Instead of being limited to the 1,000 mb/s read speeds, it would go a lot closer to its actual rated speeds; I believe closer to 3,000 mb/s or higher read speeds. So far faster usable external storage.

Also support for more 4K monitors than the 20gbps bandwidth allows. And the ability to use eGPU should they ever should to add the functionality to iPads.


Then you are not the target audience. Other people do use the iPad more like a laptop, so this is more for them.


There's actually a reason this iPad is called iPad *Pro*


At the moment. New hardware capabilities usually mean software to work with them in Apple ecosystem. They never just add hardware for the sake of it.


Howso? Windows 7 came out in 2009 and they gave Windows 10 for free to 7 users.


The lightning cables that are included with the phone at no additional charge?


Galileo, figaro


Edit:

Galileo, four point oh


“I wouldn’t pay to see Barbara DO Celine! Or would I?”


Then explain it pls


Yeah...except USB 4 drops the thunderbolt branding and also is usb-c with enhanced functions (meeting the old thunderbolt 3 spec).


USB 4.0, which uses a USB-C port/cable, mimics Thunderbolt 3 as far as I understand it:

>	The USB4 solution specifically tailors bus operation to further enhance this [by] enabling the further doubling of performance.”

>	Yep, double the performance (40Gbps) compared with the fastest version of USB 3.x which offered 20Gbps. However, there is a bit of a sour note becuase that's exactly the same speed as Thunderbolt 3, meaning that there will be no enhancement for current Thunderbolt 3 devotees on a standard that will be several years old already.


They developed it jointly and in several books on the topic it's fairly clear that Apple pushed the thunderbolt name because they wanted it to sound similar to lightning. Apple totally came up with the name. Thunderbolt and lightning was not some happy accident.


And it was actually joint development of Intel and Apple...


My Thinkpad has two, plus a USB-C next to it. Its mainly useful for docks and external graphics.


Same here.  I have yet to find any peripherals that takes advantage of it, though.


google good apple bad >:c


This just gave me a horrible visual.


Well a USB-C port can provide charge, but has nothing to do with being Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt is a high speed connection, so you’re only really utilizing the thunderbolt capabilities if you’re using a Thunderbolt Display or eGPU


Which model do you have?


Go-fast stickers you slapped on yourself don’t count as “icons”!


You can also use a usb drive


[deleted]


>unless Apple is planning on making major changes to how the iPad functions.

That's the whole point. 

Yeah, iOS is very limiting in file management right now, but Apple has already started building the bridge towards merging iOS and macOS. 

In time, it'll be easier, I feel.

I'd say Apple will update software on one or both machines and allow easier file transferring over Thunderbolt, or perhaps it will provide some special connector that uses the Thunderbolt protocol but is specific to Mac's so this feature only works with them. 

But I think either way this functionality will be integrated and expanded. 

External monitor support is already possible on iOS devices, Thunderbolt would make that better but I just don't think that's the only thing they are doing with it, if it all. I think it's for file transfer. 

Also, you do know about iTunes file sharing right? I'm not sure if that lets you put videos directly into the Photos app, but you could still transfer directly by cable to another app and I'm thinking even the Files app.


The reason I switched to android after having the first 2 iphones was the difficulty in transferring files and having to use the steaming pile that was iTunes back then. It's disappointing to hear this is still the case


USB-C come in USB2 USB3.x in many many many many many many many numbers and gen


They updated their naming a while ago to make it less clear than mud...

USB 3.0 is now USB 3.2 Gen 1 (max of 5gbps)

USB 3.1 is now USB 3.2  Gen 2x1 (max 10gbps)

USB 3.2 is now USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (max 20 Gbps)


Then there is USB 4 which is 40gbps.  USB 4 specification actually has Thunderbolt 3 in it, although not Thunderbolt 4.

Urg....

*Edit* a few typos


This isn't necessarily true. You could plug a thunderbolt cable into a USB-C port and it *should* work just fine but depending on what you're doing it won't work the other way around. I'm in IT and its an almost constant struggle to explain why they can't use their phone charger to connect their display to their laptop even thought they are physically the same connector.


I don’t want to out myself here, but my dad is very involved and he is also my proper hero. He so super smart, kind, and driven towards excellence, all of which he bring to his volunteer roles in IEEE. I’ve been to a couple of their conferences and group gatherings and all of their leadership are brilliant servants of their fields with the purpose of helping industry/tech and people advance further.  They are all like the Justice League heroes (or the Avengers if you prefer) :)


Hold on, now. Are you trying to tell me that [laserdiscs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc) might be at the end of their days?


Just make the iPad dual boot macOS (including Rosetta), and we are done as far as I am concerned.


My only issue is the transfer speeds to external drives. I can copy TO the iPad from an SSD 800mbs but TO the iPad 40mbs. Apparently the only way around this is having the SSD formatted in a proprietary Apple file system... defeating the point of using the ssd to move files back and forth from our PCs.
  
Edit: I think I have that backwards in regard to to/from I can’t recall it’s just a pisser either way


I don't get why anyone expects a mobile form factor to be the same as a computer. It never will be. If you need a computer with all the functions of the traditional OS/hardware, get a computer. Phones and tablets are limited by nature. Less memory, the app UI, no ports, etc.


Thunderbolt uses USB-C hardware; you don't need adapters for that. I think you're confusing thunderbolt and lightning.


I have to have both USBC to thunderbolt AND…

The port on the iPhone 12 is lightning. Thunderbolt is a different technology that the newest Thunderbolt 3/4 uses the same USBC style plug, which is what’s on your iPad. You’ll never notice a difference with what your already doing.


Thunderbolt is USB C, lightning is what you're thinking of.


You’re getting confused. The port on your iPhone is lightning. Thunderbolt shares the same connector as USB-C. Thunderbolt ports also basically always support USB-C (the cables don’t, however).


> Therefore, I have to have both USB C to thunderbolt AND my USB C to USB C almost everywhere I go.

See? So much versatility right there.


If you’re connecting Thunderbolt devices (eGPUs and very fast storage are the most common) yes. Otherwise not much. And, for that matter, your eGPU will thank you for not being put on a shared bus.


Yes.  TB docks have significantly more bandwidth potential. a TB dock can drive and daisy chain multiple 4k displays, support 10g LAN, faster USB for 3.1 gen2 10gig transfer, UHS-II SD card support, etc.

They're more expensive than a typical USB C dock but they're much more capable if you need to connect lots of data/bandwidth-hungry devices.


Yes, Thunderbolt is basically USB-C on steroids. It can support higher data speeds and additional data protocols.


I don’t know why but this is so hilarious to me, someone pushing their tablet to game at 100fps


Sorry, yes that is correct. You need a thunderbolt cable to do thunderbolt things. Regular type-C can be used at slower speeds.


I think you're misreading this a bit. You won't have to buy a new cable unless you want to do Thunderbolt stuff. Apple isn't making you buy a new cable. They're adding a new connection option. If you don't want to buy a new cable, just stick to USB devices.

IMO, the only major driver for Thunderbolt will be high resolution (≥5K) displays with integrated ports. I don't know if you've used a laptop with a USB-C display, but it's really nice to have a single connector to charge your device, drive the display, and have peripherals connected to the display instead of the device.

Currently this works up to 4K @ 60 Hz. If this rumor is true, it's possible that Apple is going to introduce a consumer tier ≥5K display, because I can't see them aligning this with their 6K XDR, which costs more than $5,000.


He literally just said you don’t need to buy a thunderbolt cable if you don’t intend to use it.

Do people specifically come to the Apple sub to say dumb shit that doesn’t make any sense?


And then stops shipping you the charger to "save the environment"


It can drive multiple 60Hz 4K displays. A completely absurd level of capability for a standard office environment. :)


Im talking about 2  2560x1600 monitors in my case which can't be driven at 60hz but the 4K limits are even lower. Remember driving a 4k monitor will roughly be equivalent to driving 4 1080p's. Admittedly in an office environment most are probably using 1080p 60hz and it's not an issue but Apple users may be using higher end displays.

Apple's latest displays are 5k 60hz at the moment so you could only drive one and they may well want to increase the refresh rate on that as they have with the iPads and iPhones.


See my other answer yes a simple Google will clear it up for you USB-C maximum is about 3 x 1080p at 60hz or 2 x 4k at 30hz. Not exactly going to cover someone with 2 Apple displays or similar.


But it's still gibberish. Thunderbolt isn't faster than USB-C - it literally runs over a USB-C port. It can't be faster than the port it runs on.



And just to be clear- all Thunderbolt **3** is USB-C - Thunderbolt 2 and earlier was Mini Displayport.


How many displays do you run off your tablet? And on top of that, how strong do you think the GPU in a tablet is to drive multiple 4k displays (which usb3/C can *also* do). I would say you're arguing an extreme edge case on an already sales constricted "pro" model


You could run 2x4k@60hz I guess, or in my case transfer a bunch of movies real quick. New tech capabilities bring new possibilities. I’m sure Apple will find some cool shit to do with the bandwidth.


They can charge another +$200 for it.


Bandwidth is a serious limiting factor as well, having several 4K monitors takes a lot of it. For example, Usb 3.1 gen 1 only supports 4K 30hz.


Hopefully thats coming in iPad OS 15, makes sense for them to prepare for that update with this connector


As a mobile content creator, this is huge news for higher resolution recordings.


Yeah, but this makes it more likely to happen.


Who said the monitor has to be portable? You could dock your iPad at your (home) office and work on the big screen while having the tablet on the road.


If you use SwiftUI yes it is, the ui part however wasn't the problem, there are some UI elements that are not available on different OS's so even with SwiftUI it isn't as easy as it sounds, the functional part and third party pods were always the problem.

Even if you weren't using any there is just some functionality that isn't transferable between the OS's as well or have different syntax/ways that need to be done to achieve the same functionality. 

Combine that with having to check for OS version(ex: iOS 12.1), Apple changing default functionality on new OS releases(looking at you date pickers for 13.4+) your code quickly becomes less and less useable cross OS.

Can it be done yes it can, but currently working on an enterprise app available on every platform aside from macOS(releasing soon) I can tell you that the code isn't as reusable as you think.


I wish they'd taken cues from Lightning when they made USB-C. Lightning is far superior, form factor-wise, to any of the USB implementations.


Thunderbolt is standard that's faster and enables many other things, USB-C is just the connector, USB 3.1 and whatever is the standard for most USB-C.

Thunderbolt > USB 3.1


The physical characteristics are the same, but they can run multiple protocols which overlap.   Same with Display-Port: Just because the connector are the same doesn’t mean that all can do the same. 

People don’t appreciate how ahead Apple was with lightning, compared to USB. It was the USB consortium that dragged their feet before finally agreeing on USB-C,which, at the bedinning had some unsolved problems, like reliable audio. And thunderbolt is better than USB-C, too, but at least this time they agreed on a common port which can support both protocols. IF builders are willing to spend money – just plugging in an USB-C device into a thunderbolt port will not enhance it. Kinda like old USB devices working with USB3 ports, but not getting for it.


Nah I get it, this sub is notorious for killing the messenger, especially if it's about Apple.


Power two monitors from an iPad? Is that possible?


They're going to need to add proper multi-monitor support in iPadOS for this anyway, currently you can only mirror the ipad's screen at its native resolution. 

The M1 also only supports 1 external display, not sure if this would be different on whatever A series processor we get in this.


All pointless use cases for a tablet my dude


Pointless for a tablet.


Usb C does all that my man


I literally have HDMI and DP monitors, speakers, mic, cam, LAN, mouse, keyboard, and a bunch of USB ports for normal USB devices like an SSD, running through a single USB-C port on my laptop right now.

And yes, it fast charges off it too.

Oh, but it *is* universal, common, and therefore cheap.


I have a 15in usbc portable ultra thin HD external monitor I use right now with my 2020 IPP.  So what else ya got.


Two NVMe drives could max out 40 gb/s worth of bandwidth incidentally.


My point is that they could easily have USB-C ports  on their phones like just about every other phone on the market, but instead choose to have their own port. So, if you forget your charger at home, you can’t just borrow a charger from someone with an android phone, or use the USB-C cable you have for other devices.

I really wasn’t expecting to get so much pushback on this. Sticking with a proprietary charger is objectively worse for most consumers. Is there an advantage to lightning cables that I’m missing?


Magnificoo-ooo-ooo-ooohh


USB C is a port specification. 

Thunderbolt is a data transfer protocol. Thunderbolt 3.0 specifically uses the USB C port.

A device having USB C could mean a lot different things. USB 2.0 (480Mbps), USB 3.0 (5Gbps), USB 3.1 (10Gbps), USB 3.2 (20Gbps), Thunderbolt 3.0 (40Gbps). A range of alternate modes it could possibly support, making it effectively an HDMI or DisplayPort for instance. A range of power transmission standards all defined by USB PD. There's a lot of possibilities. 

All Thunderbolt 3.0 ports use USB C. But not all USB C ports support Thunderbolt.


For a laptop, the main upside of it would be plugging in a desktop graphics card when « docking » at home.


Dell makes a nice thunderbolt dock for it but at $260... I’ll pass.


HP elitebook and Hp envy 360


Honestly I think you’re going to be looked at like a Martian if you use the actually correct “USB 3.2 Gen 2x2” terminology. Yeah, “fun” fact “USB 3.0” “USB 3.1” are technically considered defunct and replaced by USB 3.2 Gen <1|2|3>.

For actual earthlings, whether the comically inept naming commission of the USB forum likes it or not, common parlance is to assume “USB-C” means the particular connector on question is not thunderbolt 3 certified. To the masses, all thunderbolt 3 uses the USB-C connector, but not all USB-C is thunderbolt. Therefore, it’s an easy enough distinction to just say “thunderbolt” when it is, and assume when omitted you’re talking about the remainder of use cases.


Yup got a usb c port here running on usb 2 standard on my old android/windows dual-boot tablet.


Pedantics


that's because thunderbolt is Intel ip, Intel recently made thunderbolt 3 license free because they've recently implemented thunderbolt 4


What about superspeed? /S


This is super clear the numbers i am saying just arent.


That’s what I was telling them for their use(charge/usb-c) but I can see how my desire to simplify might confuse them >.<  I bet there gonna try to use a display with it now and just expect ghosting on the mouse lol.

Year 2 in the IT world, I know your struggle!


It wouldn’t even need to dualboot really since iPad apps can run on Mac. It would just need a streamlined interface. 

I doubt they’ll go that direction though since they made a big deal about separating iOS out into iPad OS not that long ago.


This is the real endgame for the iPad.  I've been PC only for years.  But I tested a new M1 Mac, and decided to get one to replace a dead windows laptop (I still have a beefy windows desktop; it's not that's big a switch when I just need something for travel and casual stuff).

Putting MacOS on the iPad Pro would be a real game-changer.

I've largely gotten around this by just dumping all my files to a NAS and using 3rd party Stratospherix app "FileBrowser" to connect to the NAS or an SMB share on my PC and move stuff back and fourth on my phone/ipad/etc.

It's not quite as easy as just plugging in and dragging stuff but that was always a little wonky to begin with on iOS.

I still have an older model ipad pro so if they finally get this one right with extending the display instead of mirror and a more robust plug in and move stuff to/from external storage or even thunderbolt/usb C dock support for kb/m/ethernet/etc, I'll be all over this.


You're correct that they are limited by the nature of their operating system, app ui.

However, Apple actively removed ports and headphone jacks as a way to maximise the profit on dongles etc. Which is overall a dick move.

Tablets could absolutely have the transfer speeds of computers, they just need Apple to add the right ports.


iPad Pro has 6GB RAM.  The M1 Air came out six months later and starts at 8GB.

The M1 Air has one extra thunderbolt port but needs a dock for any serious expansion - just like a thunderbolt iPad.

OS and app UI is deliberate segmentation by Apple, and is the only real limiting factor at this point.


Same here. TBH, I recently purchased an iPad Pro and I absolutely adore the ability to get out of my desk chair and use it for browsing the web, reddit, drawing, playing some games like Hearthstone. I mean, it's basically replaced my computer for my free time activities during the week. 

Is it a laptop? No it's not. I still do my work on a Macbook. Is it an incredible device? I think so.


It's all very very frightening


So I could plug a USB C into this plug in and it would work? Why not just call it a USB C then?


Within the context of a tablet, are people actually using these ports for anything other than charging?


>Do people specifically come to the Apple sub to say dumb shit that doesn’t make any sense? 

I dunno, you'd probably have to look over on the Apple sub.


Priceless. 

They want to save the environment so all those wage slaves in Asian countries have a pretty view to look out at while working 20 hours a day just to have multiple different iphone models release every year


This is so idiotic.
The cable choice is completely irrelevant and if all your devices are now using the same power cables it stands to reason that you already own compatible power adapters.


Lots of nvme drives will be capped before 40gbps, so it won't go nearly as far as that, it sounds like diminishing returns to me, just to up the price. We'll see!


In the grim darkness of the future there will only be 30hz


Why?


How?


For about 5 minutes until the battery dies.


I think you're a bit confused (fair enough, it is confusing!) but Thunderbolt 3 *uses the USB-C connector*. Earlier Thunderbolts had a different connector but Thunderbolt 3 looks exactly the same as USB 3 using a USB-C connector, except there is a little lightning bolt symbol next to it. (Nobody would ever confuse that for power right?)

The cables also look the same except for the lightning bolt symbol, but they aren't compatible. As in, you can't use a standard USB-C cable to connect to an external Thunderbolt 3 dock.

Yeah it's really confusing.


What you don't see or understand is that with all of those devices, you have decreased performance because of bandwidth.


Imagine hooking up that iPad Pro to a 30” 6K display, for professional use, hence the name “Pro”.


Well you just got a list that you mostly ignored because YOU have a monitor that works with your iPad.

In reality Thunderbolt will probably be more of a business benefit rather than consumer.  Means potentially using iPads instead of Macs or in addition, because that Thunderbolt dock can be used with either an iPad or a Mac.  Currently different accessories are required for docking an iPad versus a Mac.  Thunderbolt on the iPad would change that.


Those puppies read at 20 gb/s now?!?!

^I’m ^just ^a ^poor ^boy, ^nobody ^loves ^me


Also, doesn't USB 4.0 incorporate the entirety of the Thunderbolt 3.0 standard for its fastest version while dropping the Thunderbolt branding...?


Well that's not confusing at all.


> USB 3.1 (10Gbps)

Except when it's USB 3.1 Gen 1 in which case it's 5Gbps.

 > USB 3.2 (20Gbps)

Except when it's USB 3.2 Gen 1 which is 5Gbps and USB 3.2 Gen 2 (or 1x2) which is 10Gbps.

 > Thunderbolt 3.0 (40Gbps)

Except when it's only supplied 2 PCIe lanes (example: Dell XPS 15 9560), in which case it's 20Gbps.

 > A range of alternate modes it could possibly support, making it effectively an HDMI or DisplayPort for instance.

Thunderbolt must always support Displayport Alt-Mode which is adaptable to HDMI. USB-C can support it but doesn't always (see: most phones that aren't Samsung flagships).

 > A range of power transmission standards all defined by USB PD.

Except when a Thunderbolt 3 port doesn't support USB-PD as is the case with a number of gaming laptops which need more than USB-PD's 100W limit to function correctly.

USB 3.x is a clusterfuck and so is Thunderbolt 3. Thunderbolt 4 (forced 40Gbps, 4 PCIe lanes, integrated controller, USB-PD mandatory) mostly resolves this but we've only seen it in a few high-end laptops for now. USB 4 seems to attempt to fix the USB 3.x mess but its spec is so handwave-y, like Thunderbolt 3's, that I'm almost certain manufacturers will manage to butcher it once it comes to market.


I thought it was USB 3 2x2 or did they rectify that idiocy?


It's the same confusion that started back with the unibody macbooks. They had thunderbolt capable mini display ports for video out. Atleast at that time there was little tangible benefit to the increased speeds that thunderbolt supported (for peripherals).


I like how you said no, was challenged to an explanation and fucking grand slammed that shit. Bravo, thanks for teaching me something new.


So can I plug stuff in or no.

Christ, leave it to HP to take an already confusing standard and make it more confounding.

So [this lightning logo](https://i.imgur.com/szRpCQZ.jpg) is the proper and official logo for Thunderbolt, with the little arrow at the bottom there. 

[This logo from your HP](https://i.imgur.com/i48DjdX.jpg) is whatever HP wants it to mean, which I guess is an always charging port. It's not a universal logo, it's just something HP slapped on, probably with intention to trick a few people into thinking they have a Thunderbolt port. Sorry, I have an incredible bias towards HP anything, all from horrible past experiences, laptops mainly.


That’s why saying it’s interchangeable a big mistake. People who read that line will spread the misinformation and ended making the standard even more complicated.

All 737 fly the same way IGNORE THE MCAS.

Lightning is expensive because of the chip inside each cable. USB-IF say hello (lol another term to throw in the simple 1 USB to rule them all)


I speedtest all my USB devices when I get them. I learned the hard way, after spending WAY too long trying to figure out why data transfer didn't work, only to find out that the cable I was using was a power-only USB. After that experience, I decided to never need to remember which cables are good for what again, and to only buy good ones that are all interchangable, and are all validated. If it has a C port, it's at least 3.0. 

There are a lot of cables and flash drives on Amazon that claim to be USB 3, but are really USB 2 at best. I like to send those back for refunds, and so it counts against the scam peddlers.


They said that nobody had figured it out and they hadn’t either and so they wouldn’t do it just to jump on the bandwagon. They said they felt like iOS was the best touch experience for touch screens and macOS is the best experience for touchpad and mice. So if they feel like they have an adaptable solution that works for all screen and input types, I’m sure they’ll implement it. 

But I’d say customers probably agree since iPads vastly outsell android and PC tablets.


They only separated it so they wasn't literally using the same codebase for all iDevices. 

They made use of the extra screen real estate and performance that iPads had, so they split the codebase and made iPadOS. 

It's likely, and very feasible, for Apple to merge iOS and iPadOS and macOS together, as time goes on with Apple Silicon and Rosetta.

EDIT: For anyone who wants to go down this rabbit hole between me and DigitalBork, notice his comment immediately under this one. 

He said the iPad relies on special hardware to run Rosetta. 

Keep that entire sentence in mind. They are saying the iPad **needs** this hardware to even run it. Not that it can run it but different hardware speeds it up. 

It's petty for me to do this, but I think it's important for people to know. DigitalBork makes some points, good for people to know, but fails to understand mine.


Personally, I want a 14" MacBook Pro 2 in 1 that can switch to iOS.


My next laptop will probably be a Surface. If iPad ran MacOS, it would be an iPad instead. It’s that simple - they are cutting out a huge part of the market for the sake of aesthetics. That’s Apple.


>game-changer

Laughs in Microsoft Surface


But then how do you continue to sell overpriced laptops?


I love my MacBook Pro with the M1 chip. Sooo smooth. Big Sur runs like a dream...
Intel chip who?


I purchased a base model Macbook Pro 13 M1 yesterday, and I absolutely love it. Endless battery, and amazing performance. 

People can call me an Apple shill if they want. This is the first Mac I've ever had, and it's likely to get me to switch full time. I feel the integration and merging of macOS and iOS will only get better from here on out.


But it must be THINNER! (Nevermind that people still constantly ask for more ports and better batteries!)


Windows surface pro is a pretty good medium between tablet and laptop. I had an original and the simple switch from a laptop UI to tablet UI was incredible.


This. And the pros are so much better than the straight iPad. The bigger screen and the introduction of the Apple Pencil instead of just using a finger or a weak stylus. 

-yes I know that tablets did that before Apple. But I’m in an Apple universe with work.-


Mama mia

Thunderbolt builds on top of USB-C. It's compatible with USB-C standard stuff, but Thunderbolt specific devices with Thunderbolt cables are basically external PCIe slots. 40 Gb/s data transfer (4X USB 3 on regular USB-C), 6K video, 4K 120 video, or multiple monitors on one cable, high power delivery, etc. Laptops with Thunderbolt can be used to dock with just one cable, and you can even connect an external GPU.


USB C is the connector type, which can carry USB or Thunderbolt data protocols. Power delivery is cross compatible for the most part.


Because you can plug a display into it. Or an external graphics card.

The plug is the same as USB-C because it would have been dumb to come up with a different shape. But it's not just a usb port. It's an everything port. It does the usb part too.


You can actually plug the current iPad Pro in to a tv or a larger monitor. It’s only screen mirroring tho.  Hopefully future brings more laptop/desktop like capabilities, like monitor (or two) plus usb devices all handled thru a single port.


I have a dongle that gives me the ability to use hard drives and connect a non bt keyboard and mouse.


The point stands. It was a dumb comment.


Smaller, more robust, less prone to gather dust/lint in both plug and receptacle, easy to clean contacts. Is there any part of the form factor you think is better in USB?

A monitor connected via TB3 to an ipad also charges it buddy.


That's why people use hubs for monitors tho.... That's like, one of the main advantage of USBC


Not sure I follow... Is it confusing?


I have a dual 4K monitor setup through usb-c. My MacBook supports thunderbolt but it isn’t a thunderbolt dock.


USB c does all that stuff. 

How do you think of laptops with USB c work?

You think power doesn’t come in to the port on current iPads? Lol


Their comment was replying to “ Useless ? Maybe you think so but it does have lots of usages that are not covered by usb.”

Then the other commenter listed a few things that USB C does well, with no additional benefits. 

So then in your comment you added swapping a dock from Mac to iPad, which is a novel benefit, but also a limited use benefit. Since USB C is more common, it seems this mostly benefits Apple.


Businesses (except for graphic business) are really not looking to get a device in house that is only supported by one single product. Most commercial business run windows and steer away from anything Mac and their proprietary bullshit.


40 Gb/s is = to 5 GB/s.

I think the above statement is true and in fact 1 drive can do it.

Samsung 980 Pro is rated up to 6900MB/s | ~ 55Gb/s.

That's scorching fast.... Mind you beyond synthetic tests most people would be hard pressed to get those speeds.


He's just a poor boy from a poor family,


^I’m ^just ^a ^poor ^boy, ^I ^have ^a ^Samsung


Kind of, yes. 

They had a chance to fix a lot of the confusion with USB with the 4th generation. They could have made the 4.0 standard only have one version, just like Thunderbolt, where it just supports the full specification entirely or it doesn't get to call itself USB 4.0.

But they bungled it once again. USB 4 is just like 3, it supports a range.


Maybe an analogy could be all highways (USB-C) support cars, but not all highways support multiple lanes of traffic (Thunderbolt).


The letter is how it looks the number is what it can do. 

USB C is a connection standard not a protocol. You can send a lot of stuff via a USB C connector. Power, usb data, monitor signals and so on. 

Thunderbolt 3 is a very high speed protocol that uses the USB C connector. USB 4 is about the same as Thunderbolt but it isn't widely used yet.

A modern laptop dock with a couple of monitors connected to a laptop via a single cable is probably thunderbolt 3 via usb c.


What I've described so far is really not that confusing at all to be honest.

What gets confusing as hell is if I started to explain the naming conventions the USB Implementors Forum came up with for USB 3.2. It's so fucking stupid at this point that I'm not even going to use it. It's just 5Gbps, 10Gbps or 20Gbps USB for me.


Correct. It's not.


It isn’t at all. All sedans (Thunderbolt) use tires (USB-C) but not everything with tires is a sedan. They could also be trucks (USB 3.0), etc...

USB-C describes hardware. At the end of the day it’s just wires carrying whatever electrical signals you put through it. 

Thunderbolt 3.0 and USB 3.1 describe a transfer protocol, or more simply, the signal you out through the wires.


They didn't rectify that idiocy.

I feel like its actually less confusing to not even mention the real names for these standards. Normal I wouldn't do that, hiding information only makes things more confusing... but in this case, the idiocy is just too big.


>Atleast at that time there was little tangible benefit to the increased speeds that thunderbolt supported (for peripherals).

HUGELY disagree to that end...

I work in Post Production, and before Thunderbolt the best DAS protocol on the market was FireWire 800. Thunderbolt completely changed the game here for video editors, and made high bandwidth DAS RAID solutions a reality. Before Thunderbolt, if you wanted more bandwidth than FireWire 800, you were likely using a fiber NAS or SAN... massive difference in price compared to a simple Thunderbolt DAS for a solo editor.

Thunderbolt is absolutely fucking incredible, and the lifeblood of my industry.


You can plug anything into anything if you try hard enough.


I seriously would love it, it has all the ports I need, but work won’t let me expense it and if I ever leave the company I’ll have no use for it so I just can’t bring myself to do it :( otherwise I’d buy it right now.


Yeah this is exactly it

I have had a lot of success with HPs over the years mind. one of those YMMV things I guess


With the M1 and Rosetta there’s very little reason to separate them anymore, it really just comes down to interface. If you could put an M1 in an iPad with a dock, it could function nearly identically to a MacBook Air- remove the dock and it switches back to ‘iPad’ mode. 

Since all the apps pretty much run natively on M1, and Rosetta handles the rest, there’s basically no barrier to making this happen at this point.


Don't the M1 Macs support iOS apps anyway?


Personally I just like my mac and OS X and have no desire to ever touch an iPad again.


See, if I'm going to do detachable tablet-laptops, I want the smallest machine that both fits a full-size keyboard and keeps a normal-ish screen ratio.  If the Surface Go didn't perform poorly, it would be my idea machine.


I almost grabbed a Surface pro to replace my dead laptop.  The final decision was an M1 Air, or a Surface Pro.  Both are great machines.


By selling similarly priced tablets + keyboards + pens.


I’ve yet to find a windows laptop with the same battery life and performance as a MacBook Air for anywhere close to the 999 price, $879 give or take with educational pricing. For the price and performance/battery life, the M1 stomps windows laptops. Gaming is essentially its favorable lasting crutch for windows, for now.


You could totally say that about Intel Macs.  But when you look at performance and benchmarking, M1 Macs perform better than similarly priced (and even much higher priced) PCs.  

I'm just not sure I need both a MacOS iPad Pro AND an Air.  So I guess you're right in that regard.


I feel like a shill saying all these good things.  It helps though that I have a Windows desktop with beefy specs (relatively, I have a 9th Gen i7, and a 1080TI) for gaming and the occasional render.  I'll never be a full Mac convert - but as a daily driver laptop, I'm happy with it.


I had the Pro 3. It was a good device as well, agreed. If they had procreate, I might have gone that direction again.


Galileo, Figaro!!!


“You can connect an external GPU” 

Holy crap 😳


Usb literally stands for universal serial bus. It's already an everything port. This is just apple rebranding old ideas and calling them new


From my very limited experience the lightning port is a dust magnet, and breaks easily when cleaning it.


Broken a couple lightnings, once it was  a shitty cord, once by stepping on it at home. I don't even have apple devices.  Everything I own is usb c.  Never had one fail.   I've stepped on the usb c and it went into my foot. I think the usb c is way more robust than the lightning personally. On what exposed material do they print those pins on a lightning cable?


Not if the monitors are being powered BY the iPad, buddy. As the comment before mine was saying.


Errr yeah it is confusing. What do you mean?


Does every USB-C adapter work with an iPad? No.  Maybe for power but not for accessories.


>USB c does all that stuff.

Yes, but Thunderbolt 3 does it faster.


You would be wrong there, that’s an old school train of thought.  I work with Macs everyday in IT.  More and more businesses are switching away from Windows where possible.  IBM, Walmart, CapitalOne, Nike.  Those are large companies that switched in the past 3-4 years.  I see a lot of large businesses with IT staff joining the MacAdmin community.


Oh, you’re totally right. My head math was way off. I don’t know what I was thinking.

Ah, the joys of reddit that you get nowhere else

Goddamnit, standards committee, you had one job!


It's not super confusing if you already know it and are generally interested in tech stuff, but to everyone else it's a ridiculous mess, and the naming conventions are only part of it.

The USB people really should either hire a marketing expert, or stop trying to make each generation of the spec have multiple sub-specs and variants and whatever.


Seems like it'd be shorter to just say USB-C 40 Gbps instead of coming up with some dumb name for each different speed.


So are some devices with USB-C ports Thunderbolt compatible, or would you have to use a USB port on a mac with a Thunderbolt 3 port if a product is marketed as USB-C??  Asking because with audio interfaces my favourite model (which was Thunderbolt 2) has been replaced with a USB-C model, and I can’t get clear answers on this because nitty gritty tech details turn my smooth brain to mush!


But will it work


Sure but will developers make one app that works well for both experiences? Apple already has this problem and Android has it really bad. Nobody develops phone apps that work well on tablets. Obviously Apple doesn’t have this problem. 

But photoshop is vastly different on iPad vs Mac. Will Adobe put the effort into making the Mac version of photoshop run well on iPad as a touch interface? Will Microsoft merge office to work well on both as one app? 

It’s a huge problem for Apple if they release one OS for tablets and desktops, and developers don’t optimize for the experience on each interface. If they optimize for touch, then the desktop experience suffers and if they optimize for desktop, then the touch experience suffers. And if different developers optimize for different platforms, then all platforms suffer. 

It’s a really hard problem to solve for. Apple would need to build in and set hard UI rules and templates for developers to follow so apps work on each device no matter what the developer tries to do. And that takes even more creative control from developers than they have even now. The solution for phone vs tablet is way simpler. It’s more of a scaling problem. Where desktop windows are designed to run at a ton of different window sizes, screen sizes, etc.


Yes. But no touch screen so it's mostly worthless.


I feel that way too, but if it ran full macOS I would consider replacing my MacBook with an iPad Pro.


I preferred the M1 having had them both personally. Lap-ability was a huge benefit for me


No no you're missing the point. They're going to sell BOTH overpriced tablets AND overpriced laptops. To the same people.


Yeah, the people on this subreddit (and across Reddit in general) like the guy you responded to don’t know anything about Apple and their products.

They just see that the people they respect and look up to (other users here) make fun of Apple so they join in.

Usually these people use their machines strictly for gaming, and think building a PC makes them a computer wizard.

Meanwhile the vast majority of my software engineering peers and myself prefer Apple because the OS is way more pleasant to work with (Windows gestures and transitions are so choppy and garbage).

Also, being a UNIX system, MacBooks interface with Linux servers natively, unlike Windows. And additionally I can compile Java, C++, and Python right out of the box. No additional setup required (setting up C++ is a pain on Windows).

Homebrew makes installing stuff easy!

Also because Apple actually has an ecosystem, given they make computers, tablets, phones, and watches.

No other company even comes close to having a nice ecosystem. Windows has no phone. Android only has subpar laptops.

So many pros to MacBooks, yet these people refuse to do any research and just repeat what the others before them have said.


This basically. I keep a desktop for gaming.  The Intel Macs have poor specs for their price, but the M1 Macs are basically the best value for dollar you can get if you don't care about gaming.

I'm a little sad that Steam Link on M1 blows rights now.


Yea I picked up an Air last year since I’ve started back my education and I absolutely love it. Amazing battery life.

Still got my tower to click heads, but I’m using my Air and a second monitor for anything workstation related.


Mac OS though, yuck. I'd seriously consider a M1 mac if it ran Windows.


Beelzebub has a dongle put aside for meeeeee.


Thunderbolt was developed by Intel many years ago. It's supported by many laptops. Apple isn't rebranding anything, it is reportedly adding support for the standard for the iPad Pro.


All small ports tend to gather lint, at least when kept in pockets, but the Lightning doesn't have a connector sticking out in the middle of the port to trap lint on either side, making it less prone to hold onto it, and easier to clean becuase more room in the hole. With USB-C you even have two holes to clean.

I've never heard of anyone breaking the port, but I guess that's possible.


Lightning is smaller and not hollow, and thus harder to bend, or get leverage on it, to bend it. As for the housing and cable, well that's really up to how it's manufactured, different brands will have different quality. It shouldn't be a part of a discussion about the form factor of the connector.


Power can colloquially mean things other than to provide current to. Such as drive, or extend to.

It seemed obvious that he did not mean power as in providing the energy necessary to function.

As far as I’m aware no monitor on the market supports powering itself over TB3 by drawing power from the input device.


That's wasn't my point. You may have noticed the laptop example.

In any case, what's a really good example of something that you might use with your ipad, which requires thunderbolt and that does not work using usb-c?


faster power? I don't think that's true lol


Work in IT as well and every company I've worked at stays away from Apple like it's the devil, and rightfully so.


Easy come easy go, will you let me go

> standards committee

[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/)


They already hired a guy, that guy made this fucking mess:

* 05gbps: USB 3.2 Gen 1 = USB 3.1 Gen 1 = USB 3.0
* 10gbps: USB 3.2 Gen 2 = USB 3.1 Gen 2
* 10gbps: USB 3.2 Gen 1x2
* 20gbps: USB 3.2 Gen 2x2

All because there's some OEM somewhere that wanted to have "USB 3.2!!!" on their speclist, but by doing so it rendered the whole standard meaningless. Right now, usually I see "USB 5gig" and "USB 10gig" as the denominations most actually use.


I will have to agree to disagree here, every time a new standard comes out they go back and RENAME the old standards.

Why on earth they stopped doing simple X.Y revisions baffles me.

"USB 3.2 Gen 2x2" is AN ACTUAL NAME.


I disagree. I've explained it to lots of people in the past who knew nothing about it, coworkers, family members... explaining what USB C can do is really not that confusing. It can do a lot of different things, and there's nothing that's a mess about that. 

The naming is really what they've fucked up, not the specification itself. The true blunder was re-naming existing standards for no god damn reason other than to make manufacturers happy. Now a manufacturer can say their laptop supports USB 3.2... when it's really just USB 3.2 Gen 1 5Gbps... that's fucking stupid.


Yep. That could certainly work. There's a lot of good suggestions that would be infinitely better than what was actually implemented.


>So are some devices with USB-C ports Thunderbolt compatible

Any device that is Thunderbolt compatible will be specifically marketed as such. If a device just says it's port is USB C or any flavor of USB 3, it most likely is not a Thunderbolt port and not Thunderbolt compatible.

> or would you have to use a USB port on a mac with a Thunderbolt 3 port if a product is marketed as USB-C??

I'm not understanding what you're asking here.

>Asking because with audio interfaces my favourite model (which was Thunderbolt 2) has been replaced with a USB-C model, and I can’t get clear answers on this because nitty gritty tech details turn my smooth brain to mush!

Chances are if it just says USB C, and does not mention Thunderbolt 3.0 anywhere on the product page, then it is not Thunderbolt. Chances its USB 3. Can you share a link?


Maybe


It’s obviously a lot of work, but I think Apple is in a position right now where the transition is far easier than it’s ever been. 

- If the next iPad were to run MacOS with a streamlined touch interface, existing iPad apps would continue to run. This is great, since it means the transition could be done over years without losing access to apps. 

- Yes, developers would have to consider both interfaces. But that work is already largely done in many cases, such as, as you mentioned, Photoshop. Currently Adobe already develops two version of the app to run on each interface, so the challenge is merging the two together without sacrificing anything. Obviously not exactly easy, but again- both the Mac and iPad versions continue to run on the new device, so you’re not missing out on anything in the meantime while devs figure it out. 

- they’d actually be reducing the workload in total for developers. Similar to how the iPhone and iPad already have that advantage over Android, if apple can unify the frameworks into a single place the target platforms becomes more focused. Again, all Apple would really have to do here to make it a reality is create a streamlined touch interface for MacOS.

None of this is “flip the switch” easy, but Apple has put themselves in a really good spot to make it happen, if they really wanted to.


I feel the total opposite. I’d maybe consider a touch screen mbp, but limiting it to touch only forcing me to get some weird keyboard that maybe fits and tethering it all via some terrible cord and adapter situation, or worse yet ever dropping Bluetooth wireless inputs. Ugh.


Yeah.  I jog on treadmills a lot, so treadmill-ability was what I lost on the M1.  I decided that my phone worked well enough for treadmilling, so I went for the M1.


No I’m not. Op asked how will they continue to sell tablets and laptops. I said they will just sell both, but you’ll have to buy the tablet at the same price (when you factor in upgrades and peripherals). So yeah overpriced.


Pretty much. After seeing some of the comments on this post and on an earlier one about Apple adding Thunderbolt to iPads allegedly, I was baffled. For a sub about gadgets and technology is absolutely unreal how most of them are completely out of touch with the very thing they're commenting about.

i.e.: not knowing the difference between usb c (not usb c 4) and thunderbolt, or what any use would thunderbolt bring to devices previously limited to USB C 3.1 gen 2 speeds


Actually, given two connector housings of equal mass and identical material, the hollow one will be more difficult to bend than the solid one. The property of the geometry that reflects this is called the [second moment of area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area).


Well it's not the best idea to have the pins exposed. I've seen many damaged lighting connectors.  Never a dented usb c housing. And I just looked and they are the same length.  So I'm not sure what you're talking about. It's also thinner and more flimsy looking. What test of physical strength do you think a lightning connector would win?


Multiple usb-c ports


What, you think technological advancements can never result in faster battery charging?

So the changes are:
- M3
- OLED
- new keyboard with bigger trackpad 

None of those are the reason the iPad hasn’t taken over laptops.


The hardware is not the problem, Apple.


You can't just throw an M1 chip in them and make it bound to the app store. Gotta let that peacock fly


The apps need go get better.   I can do the Lightroom ai noise reduction on my MacBook Air.  But can’t do it on the iPad Pro.  Even though it’s the same chip.  And it’s just as capable as the MacBook Air.   There’s limits to iPad apps.  And that’s what I am tired of.  These days I use my MacBook more than my iPad.


It’s not the hardware, it’s the OS. 

People who need to do real work and have control over where and how files are stored and shared need a desktop-class operating system. 

An OS that’s optimized for touch control and keeping things “simple” is a really difficult environment for a lot of kinds of work. Even when you add a keyboard and mouse, there’s still no getting around the fact that you’re using a tablet OS and not a desktop OS.


iPad sales won’t take off until iPadOS can be a suitable macOS replacement. The chip doesn’t matter, the screen doesn’t matter, the cameras sure don’t matter.


Went sluggish after they raised the price of the base IPad. Ain’t no secret, lower the price


They should continue to iterate and improve iPadOS to the point where it is a suitable desktop OS.

Expose more of the file system. Make it so that you can control all aspects of the iPad straight from an external monitor/keyboard/mouse. Allow people to put files on the desktop. 

Allow people to run unsigned code on it. I know one thing that's keeping me from considering iPadOS is the lack of real Chrome and Chrome extensions.

Free iPadOS!

All of that means nothing unless we get more pro apps or some kind of macOS intermediary. For all intents and purposes, all the iPads are capable of more or less the same thing.


The real issue is that it isn’t that useful for most people. It’s just a big iPhone without the phone part. If you have an iPhone and a MacBook there is little reason to also have an iPad. I think if they just added touch screens, cellular connectivity and faceID to the MacBooks and Mac OS to the iPads then it would help both. I don’t think the iPad should really be it’s own thing anymore but rather simply a different form factor mac for those who want it.


I’ve had iPads since the beginning and there are three features that I want:     
1. Sunlight visible display       
2. Better battery life      
3. A real Finder and windowing system


it's 2023 and it still doesn't support multiple user accounts.


I’ve never found much use for an iPad.


I know how they can fix sluggish sales, lower f’ing prices.


It is too expensive for a device that people just use to watch video, surf the web, and read


> The next iPad Pro models — codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 — will shift to the next-generation M3 chip. They will also be Apple’s first tablets with OLED displays, the same types of screens used on the iPhone since the X model in 2017. They are crisper and brighter, and reproduce colors more accurately.

> The new models will come in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes. That’s similar to the existing lineup, but the larger model is currently 12.9 inches. 

> Something else coming with the new iPad Pro, I’m told, is a revamped Magic Keyboard. The new accessory makes the iPad Pro look even more like a laptop than the current setup and adds a larger trackpad. That addresses a complaint about the current Magic Keyboard, which debuted in 2020. 

This sounds… fine? I’m assuming it’ll be accompanied by a price increase - the current models start at $799 for the 11” and $1099 for the 12.9”. That converts to £1249 for the 12.9” here in the UK (an M2 MacBook Air with double the storage costs £100 *less* than that), so I shudder to think what this will end up costing

Personally this won’t do anything to bring me back to the iPad Pro after I replaced mine with a MacBook in 2020. Hardware has never been the problem, it’s been excellent since the first model in 2015, it all comes down to the software. [Jason Snell put up a great article a few days ago](https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/08/why-i-gave-up-on-the-ipad-only-dream/) that aligns with most of my thoughts on the current state of the iPad


Everyone’s mentioned iPadOS and starting price, but no one has mentioned the fact that iPads basically last forever. 

A device that most people watch YouTube and Netflix on doesn’t need to be replaced so often lol


The only reason I am not getting an iPad is the price tbh. It’s just a bit too expensive to be justifiable for me


The thing about tablets is: they’re not nearly as necessary as people think. They’re too big to be phone replacements, and too limiting to be desktop/laptop replacements. The most they can do is play content for you. That’s really nice but it’s destined to be a luxury item. Laptops/desktops have no business having touchscreens so they’ll not eclipse those. 

Sometimes a design goes as far as it goes at the moment and I think tablets fit that description right now. Not everything needs to be a revolution.


Prices are too damn high on iPads, fix that and you’ll reignite sluggish tablet sales.


The only thing good about an iPad Pro is the ProMotion display.


I buy iPads to read comics and . . . well mostly to read comics. But it’s amazing at that.


I get why Apple is fighting hard for no side loading on iPhone, but why is it also restricted on iPadOS? 

That M2 chip is literally a dog on a leash if it only utilizes the App Store but doesn’t allow outside developers to unlock the capabilities of a blazingly fast touch screen tablet. 

Not only that but an extensive file manager. It’ll be a perfect hub between iOS and MacOS, especially if you get a 1TB+.


Apple is competing with Apple here and getting frustrated. All the other tablet manufacturers are seeing similar drops, and are in worse places.

Why would Apple compare it’s iPad revenue with it’s Mac revenue? It would be like Samsung comparing it’s phones to its washing machines. 

Even comparing to previous years seems questionable. Tablets have plateaued. Increasing the stats won’t generate sales, especially if it comes with an increased price tag. 

* Option 1: As many have said, bring MacOS to the iPad in some format. Apple seems scared to let the iPad into Mac territory, and it’s holding it back.

* Option 2: Something genuinely new. The iPad would be perfect to host an on-device generative AI platform. Something that needs a new chip that won’t fit in iPhone yet, but gives a huge productivity boost in a way that doesn’t directly compete with Mac.


Thanks for raising the prices that much even in the regular Ipads.

Yeah, no wonder the sales arent as high as they used to be.


how many times are they gonna try to do this until they realise that their reluctance to eat into MacBook sales is the reason why this isnt working. also the apps are simply not on the level they need to be yet.


This is will be one of those rare cases when Apple needs to learn from Microsoft and have desktop capabilities like the Surface


Until the iPad is more like a laptop, I don’t see the point of upgrading from my iPad mini


It will look like all of the iPads.  Function like all of the other iPads. Cost more. It’s the Apple way.


Maybe if they stopped knee capping it with awful OS people would be more inclined.


Hardware is not the problem of low sales, it's iPadOS that's the issue.


The initial idea behind the iPad was to have something bigger than a phone and be idiot proof.

But phones back then had very small screens. 

Now, phones are big enough that most people don’t feel the need to spend hundreds, or over a thousand, dollars on another device and the phone is still as idiot proof as the iPad.

I hear enthusiasts wanting MacOS on it, but I question how many sales that would generate outside of that small group.

I can see a situation where they continue to decline in popularity.


Can they just add MacOS to them? I would buy one in a heartbeat.


they need to make it more like a MacOS instead of a bigger iOS. Microsoft Surface looks like a way better product because of this. no hardware upgrade is going to make any significant difference until this changes.


iPads are not selling because it’s an incredibly confusing product line, and because the software for them isn’t great. You’re basically spending a fortune on a glorified facebook machine.


Hardware isn't the issue but rather software.  I wouldn't trade mine with TrollStore and Dopamine for new hardware with gimped software.


add fucking user management… god damn it’s been 15 years?


“Major updates coming”

Goes on to list the mostly irrelevant minor updates that are planned. 

Cool cool cool cool cool. Nothing to see here.


Still on the iPad Air from the first revision that brought the full screen / power button touchID. Yeah it doesn’t have ProMotion but other than that I don’t see any compelling reason to update because it’s legitimately the OS that’s underdeveloped, not the devices.


Honestly what they need is to implement something similar to Samsung DeX with MacOS but let's be real, that would just tank the sale of their laptops so they never would.


I have an iPad and I really like it. However I'd like:

* MacOS/Power-Mode/AppleOS hybrid MacOS/iPadOS option

Currently I can use Remote Desktop Software to log into my MacOS to then do useful work via the iPad. But it's a workaround. There's Cloud PCs or other similar solutions via Web but none use native hardware fully of the M1 device.

* AI assistant baked in that can do useful things along with touch, pencil or bluetooth keyboard/mouse via voice input and obv. intelligent and flexible use.

This would complete multi-modal input.

* More phone options for just using the iPad for phone stuff if wanted.

Can use google voice or use iPhone but I don't like phones so it would be nice to use my 5G option on my device more.

There's solutions for all the above already via work-arounds but Apple baking in top quality software as above as standard would be adding HUGE QUALITY.

I am happy with my device and it works well with phone and MBA but the above would help me focus on the iPad as primary device (along with external monitor).


Unless they revamp the OS for ipad, it really doesn't make sense for most people.


Sluggish sales are due to iPadOS.


Jesus Christ. Please just give us better software. I don’t care if you keep on recycling the design all I want is better software.


Apple wants everyone to buy both a powerful (i.e. expensive) laptop and a powerful (i.e. expensive) tablet. How many people need (and can afford) that? i feel like the market for people who want both a Mac and an iPad is pretty saturated already, but they're not willing to make the iPad more attractive to others because they fear it'll hurt Mac sales, and they're not willing to make a cheap iPad to capture the bottom end.


Just imagine if that thing had a real operating system.


Maybe Apple’s plan to boost sales is to add the calculator app


iPad Pro should have Mac OS at this point there is no excuses anymore.


[deleted]


You know what will fix sluggish sales? Make the iPad Pro more affordable. Hardware isn’t the problem: The device is already an incredible piece of hardware.


I have an older iPad Pro and would love to upgrade but for the price its really hard to justify when it rarely ever gets used for something other than web browsing, the occasional book and youtube.


I have an m1 iPad Pro. It collects dust. I rather just work off my M1 MacBook. I’ve been trying to work iPads in my workflow for years and it just doesn’t work at all. Other than watching videos/movies or putting in background Spotify.


OLED screen alone would put me back in the game


I have an ipad pro.

Honestly windows is more useful for productivity


I tried to use an iPad Pro as a laptop for 2 years. It SUCKED


i don’t consider myself the majority by any means, but my ipad use case is basically what we all recommend people get macbook airs for - content consumption, web browsing, email, texting. if i need to do any actual work i whip out my macbook pro. i honestly like it this way because it means a LOT less charge cycles on my work machine.


A faster iPad isn’t going to solve the limitations of the OS…


The iPad OS should only be for iPad Air and below. The iPad Pro should have an OS that is a Mac for touchscreen


They need to fix their Wi-Fi which cuts out constantly when streaming. I returned 2 iPads and finally gave up and bought a Samsung tablet.


I'll take a 16" iPad please.


IPad OS needs to be touch Mac OS and have all that functionality to be what was hinted at 2010

Have your object oriented engineers and designers figure out how to reverse engineer that and then we will be cooking .


Why would anyone buy a Pro these days? The Air now does 90% of what the Pro does for a lot less


I’ve been using a refurbished iPad Pro 2018 for the past few years and haven’t run into any limitations that would require the newer models. It already has most of what I need: the refreshed slim bezel design, 120 Hz display, and Magic Keyboard compatibility. Sales are slowing down because much like laptops, there is no reason to upgrade so often and especially for those with very simple workloads that the iPad is mostly aimed at.


The iPad story talks a lot about the Vision Pro story, both platforms are quite similar and if the iPad can't sprout it's wings as a productivity platform it does not bode well with the headset's story.


I use my iPad for Reddit and streaming, my 2017 pro is still overkill.


I have the first version of the current 12.9" chassis from back in 2018, and I have zero reason to upgrade. I use it a decent amount, especially when traveling, but I just don't do anything that stresses it power-wise, so I especially wouldn't need an M-series in there.

Like a lot of people are saying, I would need more capabilities in the software to even consider an upgrade; if this one broke tomorrow, I'd be looking for a refurb 2018-2020 era one and saving money.


My iPad Pro would get a lot more use if I had Xcode on it.


I got tired of waiting for Apple to do something with the iPad line, so I got a Z fold 5. Still have an iPhone as my main phone but the Z fold fills my tablet/note taking/gaming needs.


As an ipad pro owner I cannot stress enough how it's a product I'd recommend to \*\*almost\*\* nobody. Artistic types might enjoy the beautiful screen and apple pencil usability but for an average user it just doesn't make sense. Grab a regular ipad or an ipad air if you need a tablet and otherwise the equivalent chip Macbook is absolutely a far more versatile and usable tool that can do everything the ipad (minus the pencil) can but isn't stunted by a gimped OS


I don’t know a single person that has said “damn this iPad Pro is slow I wish it was faster”. Don’t get me wrong I’ll never complain about better performance, but there needs to be more than spec bumps to increase sales. 

Personally, the iPads are nice but it still feels inconvenient to use compared to an actual laptop. Plus there’s still so much that you just can’t do on an iPad compared to a laptop.


Have they tried lowering the price? Most people got a massive buying power cut over the last 3 years. Mine was 5% buying power loss. So of course luxuries like tablet would get cut from the budget.


My 2022 iPad Pro 12.9 is one of the best Apple purchases I’ve ever made. People knock stage manager but I haven’t turned it off since I got it. I don’t think OLED is that big a game changer.


Listen I think a foldable phone is a very niche product that wasn't really thought through. A foldable iPad Pro Mini though is a game changer.


There’s literally no reason to buy an iPad if you don’t draw. Want a bigger screen? Buy a MacBook Air, want something smaller but still big? Buy an iPhone max/plus


The “problem” is market saturation combined with the iPad being too good, hardware-wise, to justify an upgrade. I’m what you could consider an iPad “power user” and I only “upgraded” from the 10.5” Pro this past week because Woot was selling the M1 models for, like, 40% off.

It’s more than enough machine for most tasks.

It’s not a functionality problem. It’s not an iPadOS problem (the cold truth is that MacOS on iPad is a terrible idea - most people calling for it wouldn’t *actually* switch over, and doing away with the simplicity and straightforwardness of iPadOS as it’s designed would alienate the existing user base). It’s as simple as just about everybody who wants an iPad, at this point, already has one - and it works just fine.

I'm waiting until they release an ipad ultra...give me a good 14-15 inch ipad already please 😍

After using the tab S8 and S9 ultra, I don't want to go back to something as small as the 12.9 inch.


No reason to have an iPad when we already have big phones.


No one's got money bro. Apple's considered a luxury brand.


Make it work with the Apple Watch. I can’t stand that I have to do Apple fitness on my phone or Apple TV. 

Also, allow us to put multiple user accounts on one iPad. A lot of them out bought for family use.


The m2 is already waaaay over powered. Cameras are amazing even compared to studio display. This is a software problem apple. Hire more Craig’s


iPad Pro needs a built in kickstand


Hot take: iPhone and iPad sales are down and sluggish because…..The Peak Performance Capability software added in 11.3 that sparked that moronic lawsuit about batteries HAS ACTUALLY DONE WHAT APPLE SAID IT DOES: decrease battery aging. So people are upgrading LESS OFTEN. 

Hmmmmmmm


Fix the screen ghosting. Please Apple.


Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro release showed that they're starting to notice the iPad needs a dire change else the sales would tank. For now, there's nothing major that separates iOS and iPadOS besides the naming.


There are too many iPad models.
The Compare feature has gotten better but doesn’t explain the features that you see.
You basically have to call Apple and talk to Sales who don’t know anything about the models or go to an Apple Store to talk to a specialist.


let me know when i can natively run starfield on an ipad


who would've thought limiting M2 to App Store apps and pricing their entry level iPad up-from $329 to $449 would be a good idea 🤡


they you should spend some more time on the drawing board for a better tablet the size of the iPad mini. may be a mini Pro? the size is perfect for gaming and reading.


In my personal opinion, tablets have a different use case and aren’t as regularly manhandled as phones. 

As such, they have a 5-10 year life at minimum. I gave my old work 12.9 Pro to a family member and despite it being dropped and dented by them a few times, it’s chugging along perfectly fine. 

People will not replace tablets at the same rate as phones. Hell, even with phones there’s been a lot of consumer burnout in the space of upgrades. I hope Apple keeps the same pacing and quality in mind.


Revamp the base line. I feel like I am back in the 80s with those bezels huge enough I can draw on


I don’t want macOS on iPad. As a very casual user of the iPad (entertainment such as gaming YouTube and movies only) I love the fact that I don’t have an overburdened OS that requires a launcher for every single app I want to use. Everything is streamline and great.

macOS straight up sucks as someone who likes to use it for work (EMR), excel PowerPoint word etc, and occasional play. The browsers seem to be handicapped repeatedly to seemingly allow for ad revenue breaking addons with every update. Battle.net seems to have a memory leak of some sort where it drains my entire battery in a matter of minutes and even steam gets my M1 pro hot and bothered without any games running.


Release a 14 or 15 inch iPad pro and you’ll get my money 100%.


I’m using 2 yrs old 13” ipad pro all the time. Compared to a M1mini with 27” screeo or a light expensive pc laptop, its much better at:

1. surfing, reading news sites, reddit, facebook
2. reading magazines and books
3. Doing the above on couch

mac is better for work, laptop is good for nothing


Give them OLED display with an option to use MacOS you cowards.


I think they should discontinue tablets all together, its a concept that was cool more than a decade ago when mobile screens were small, but now you can get iphones with big screen or buy a small laptop (macbook air) with full os features.

The fact that all tablets manufacturers are having this drop in demand proves its no longer needed.

If they still want to have a middle product, then they should develop a touch screen laptop that is foldable like the Lenovo Yoga or the Microsoft Surface studio. I would buy that.


I still don't really get the point of iPads besides giving to your 10 year old child so they can play roblox. I know they've been out for like a decade and Apple has sold a billion of them but I still don't really get them


Sure


Well I have an iPad which we got for us to browse, check mail for work, etc.

It ended up with its memory full because the kids downloaded so many games on it and we use laptops for work when we need that stuff from home.

I have iPhones and computers, so the use-case of tablets is kinda in a weird spot right now.


MacOS isn't designed for a touch interface and after Microsoft tried and failed to do that with windows I don't see that ever working. I feel like we might get more specialized apps and new workflows in ipadOS however


I have 2018 ipad pro and I dont really care about newest model. When or if I have budget, spend it on earlier one. Still has great screen. And current gen Pencil is enough for most people.


pff


No tanks! \^\_\^


I love my iPad Pro for traveling. I think it is a niche product though


Please simplify all the models and offer same specs for all / most. I want an iPad mini pro. Love my current mini but I wish it just had a little bit more power and a pro motion screen.


I just want mini led display in the 11 inch iPad Pro. I don’t want the 12 inch or need it. 

Also would be cool if we could use more pro features like macos when we are running the same chipset.


Sluggish because the prices become insane globally... here in Italy a mini starts at 600€ for 256gb... they still say "start at 300" with 64gb which is useless to anyone nowdays... 

If they wanna boost sales they should start offering 128gb as base not 64 in 2023


Without reading the article can someone say if it says 2023 or 2024 for launch?


The last few rounds of hardware changes have baffled me to be honest. Sure the brighter screen is nice, but it hampered an already lackluster battery life. I also don’t understand why they added a camera bump to a device that hardly anyone uses for photos.


iPad Pro mini and we’ll talk


And they don’t think maybe it’s not the hardware but the software.


iPad 12,9 inch 3rd Generation still going strong with no problems whatsoever. Does exactly what it needs to do and I will never buy another tablet until it stops doing so.


The only thing I use my iPad for is to watch movies on the airplane. In the past I’ve used it to watch videos while I’m on a stairmaster.

It’s a pretty good single tasker but I don’t see any reason to upgrade from what I have now.


It's amazing how many people want the ability to run full macOS or side load apps on an iPad, but as soon as iphone is mentioned it becomes blasphemy to want that on an iphone.

Allow users to install what they want. Allow them to unlock the bootloader. Put it behind a warning about security if appropriate. But do not lock the owners property without their permission.


The 10th generation ipad is so disappointing, especially with that stupid apple pencil compatibility issue. I do not have high hopes.


Nothing wrong with the hardware, well a few little issues but for the most part that works fine. Gotta improve that software. Gotta make iPadOS more than just a tablet version of iOS. 

Furthermore I don’t want to deal with more subscriptions. I pay just for CSP on my iPad because I need it. If I could I would just like an option to buy a version of the software as it is and be done with it.


Unless revamped means mac os then there's no change.

State of the art hardware and lacking software is nothing new in the context of an ipad.


Maybe allow MacOS to be installed on iPad? If that happens, I’ll buy it in a second


**IT'S GOING TO HAVE A CALCULATOR**


I’m not buying another iPad until there’s an OLED screen, the miniLED screen on the iPad Pro 12” has horrible light bleeding on black backgrounds


I have the M1 12.9 and haven’t felt the need to upgrade yet.


Current MacBook Air is hard to improve upon.  I can lie in bed for hours watching tv and still get work done which is what I’m looking for at this stage in life. 

I’d like an iPad for drawing but I think I’d rather have a MacBook that I can draw on because it could also be an adjustable drawing board and I don’t need Apple’s permission to install stuff on it.


Should I wait to buy the iPad Pro or is the current generation good to buy?


People want basic tasks to not be a pain. The OS is simply inferior to any PC.


Unlike phones, people don’t upgrade tablets as often. Basically when the last one is obsolete or stops functioning for what they need it for.


Everyone that wants a tablet already has one. And I don't want one.


My pro is fine and lots of people with pro’s I know have no plans on upgrading


Keep improving non-Pro iPads with the same iPhone chips and iPadOS but the iPad Pro should come with MacOS. Everyone kept saying it even before they put M chips inside of them as Apple fans always wanted a competitor to Microsoft Surface but now they have no excuses. I feel like macOS is just not stable/good enough for "touchscreen only" devices. People will keep getting the same old "better screen, better cpu, better cameras" bullshit.


BUT ITS NOT REVAMPED!!

Faster chip/nicer screen is the same playbook they have run for the last 10 years


God the iPad debate is so tedious


I don’t need the iPad to replace my Mac.  Which frankly is an insane proposition 

But in order to upgrade from a 2020 iPad Pro I do need the iPad to be a better tablet. 

To me that means

- display legibility in direct sunlight for outdoor use  
- longer lasting battery
- better thermal management
- better charging solutions, some sort of wireless charging or MagSafe


Another expensive tablet isn't going to make me buy another one. I have 2 tablets, wife has 2 tablets, isn't that enough?


Hardware changes can’t fix software limitations, and that’s what’s keeping them from replacing laptops altogether. But I think the other consideration is that iPads (particularly Pros) are so overpowered, that people just aren’t upgrading as soon. I had my last one for 5 years, and it still felt plenty quick when I switched to an M2. I imagine this one will be more than enough for years as well.


i am only considering ipad pro for it's pen input capability but even for that it is overpriced IMO


My 2018 iPad is still running strong, and TBH, Apple really hasn't offered anything innovative since the original iPhone.

On top of that, I feel like the OS is going in the wrong direction, and Apple doesn't really know what to do with it.  Until they figure that out, or offer something innovative, I'm think I'm good.


tablet overall are lasting a long time no be it apple or not


I’m often amazed at how much Mark Gurman can stretch so little information. ￼


At this point it’s the software that needs an overhaul for me, not the hardware. I need to be able to use it more like a desktop OS if I so choose


[deleted]


If I want to use a mouse and keyboard, I use my Air.  OLED would be nice but the M2 and even M1 are still way more powerful than what is necessary for iPadOS.


When iPads are several hundreds of dollar to a thousand dollar more expensive than a laptop, then yeah I can see why sales are sluggish


I replaced the family laptop with a 12.9” iPad Pro. The large track pad and sturdy keyboard cover played a massive role in why it works. 

The rumors sound great, other than OLED. OLED is a downgrade as it will reduce the longevity of the device. iPads can easily last 6-10 years and I always use it at max brightness. That won’t be true with an OLED display.


What does selling tablets have to do with replacing laptops?


I've searched for that answer.

Without full file explorer support, ability to use full ram for one app, like davinci and better external device support, it will stagnate.

It's just a bigger iPhone with pencil support, but with an proper OS, it could be an notebook replacement. But everybody ist telling this for years, meanwhile Apple: 🙈🙉🙊


yeah, i bought and returned one because it felt so dumb and limiting being handcuffed to the glossy 'public-facing' OS. let me see files and folders dammit! not just in one app that feels negatively intuitive to use


Too many models. Too hard to choose.


Hardware still has problems like not mounting the front camera for landscape mode on pro models.   Not enough ram to do true multitasking if it  was enabled by the OS.  Adding additional usb c port so i don't need a dongle  if I want a 2nd  screen, though stage manager really sucks and needs to be scrapped.  I really want my iPad pro to be my lightweight travel computer because my 16" MacBook pro is way too heavy to haul around to a coffee shop or a quick meeting at a client.


Yeah, Tim!


It’s like driving a Ferrari in a school zone


Currently scrolling on this overpowered Reddit machine. What a waste.

PS stage manager is terrible.


I’d buy one tomorrow if it just had Mac OS on it. I just don’t know who tablets are aimed at these days. The only people I ever see using them are kids in restaurants.


Yeah I don’t get it either. The iPad + keyboard is just as thick as a MacBook. Seems super pointless to me, just get a MacBook


Perchance.


But it has Final Cut Pro now!


Don’t go chasing incremental waterfalls. We don’t want no scrubs.


Yeah… Excel on iPad angers me every single time I try to use it.


This may actually be due to Adobe’s extent of support for their apps on iPad


Agreed. I don’t see the iPad ever being more than a glorified media consumption device. People keep saying they want a more powerful OS, but since touch is the primary input method, the experience will always feel neutered. Then folks want to add keyboard and mouse support because touch sucks for a lot of pro type apps, which just ends up making the iPad a Frankenstein thing with a ton of attachments. The end result is essentially a macOS laptop with a shittier OS.


Exactly. I tried to use an iPad Pro for work for 2 years and gave up


wouldn't an ipad running osx under cut macbook sales due to price?

i think marketing ipad as a pc replacement is a miss


There are some glaring things missing but this ‘real work’ phrase is just dumb. Plenty of ‘real work’ gets done on them *right now.* what you mean is there are issues *you* have when doing *your* work, which is just as real as other work. Stop this silliness.


I agree with this take. iPadOS could be much more robust and have more macOS type features


They are busy making macOS more like iPadOS.


yes, exactly, developer here. My iPad Pro with M1 is more powerful than my MacBook Pro with an Intel i9 but it just does not matter if I can't use the underlying UNIX layer, or install what I want. I have given up on iPad because of this


Absolutely this. It doesn’t matter what they do hardware-wise. The next iPad Pro could be a literal MacBook Air, and if it ran iPadOS in its current state I still wouldn’t buy it.


That goes the same to Android tablets too. These are essentially big phones. I honestly don't see a reason why I would buy one when I can buy a laptop that comes with a terminal/a real OS at the same price, regardless if it's a Linux/Windows/Apple laptop. Tablets are just useless to me, unless they change this, not just Apple. And when someone asks me for advice about devices to buy, I always point them to a phone-laptop combo, never a tablet.


Yep. 2018 iPad Pro here and the years keep passing, but I have no reason to upgrade. I WANT a reason to upgrade, but there just hasn't bee one.  

It seems like every year Apple puts the new chip in the IPPs, making them totally overpowered for the OS except for those who need it to encode video in the mobile app version of Final Cut or whatever.

Give me an OLED/microLED display, more MacOS features, full use of the USB port, etc. Maybe I could move to a smaller phone and use the iPad for media consumption.


Now that you mention it. I’m certain I’ve never used the camera on my iPad Pro.


Time for them to offer a pro and non pro os!  Also, they need to make the camera flush mounted instead of protruding


Yes 100%. My iPad became a glorified alarm clock. I use it for that 1% of time to sign things or mark up papers.


iPadOS is so half baked at this point, especially at the price of the pro models


Makes you wonder who are the people running iPad department. Is this not obvious enough?


Yeah, I tried to work from my iPad when I first got it but it was just too cumbersome and required too many workarounds.

I really only use my iPad for media consumption nowadays. I would never get one of the expensive models just for that.


They won't because then that absolutely proves macbooks/MacOS can have touch features and apple surely doesn't want to expose that. How else are they gonna screw ya on having to buy both? 

I personally don't care, because the laptop is good enough for me. I will never get ripped off like some folks by buying an iPad that has Lee's capabilities than a laptop, but can cost same or more especially after folks buy the magic keyboard and shit at $200-$300 just for that. I just don't see a point. The laptop will outlast the iPad and honestly isn't that bad to pull out to be real. 


I don't think Apple is gonna put mac OS on there. Their best alternative would be to allow a dex like experience, but keeping it real, Apple hasn't been innovative on their iPad or iphones is many years.


> the cameras sure don’t matter

you don’t spontaneously take an ipad out of your messenger bag whenever you have a chance encounter with wildlife?


It won't be massive, but there definitely will be an uptick for sure. I tried out the iPad pro 12.9 inch with magic keyboard at an apple store, and I was kinda underwhelmed to say the least. The experience wasn't ideal, but I do feel if it was as capable as a Mac, they could really get a lot of users raving about it. It's form factor and practicality could outweigh the slight negatives I felt in terms of a cramped keyboard and a top heavy setup


Just add phone capabilities to the iPad


I don’t want macOS on my iPad. I love my iPad because most of what it can do is just more fun and pleasant to use than the same thing on macOS. Browse the web, read a document, edit a document, take notes, browse social network, even remotely use an SSH client and use FTP to transfer files.

It does the same thing, but it does it differently, with different ergonomics and adapted to a tablet layout.

Sure there is stuff i *can’t* do, but i don’t want Apple to just throw macOS on my iPad and say « Now you can ! ». If I want to use macOS, well, I have a mac, and it is lighter than my iPad with a keyboard case.

I want Apple to make the iPad *as capable* as my mac, I don’t want another mac.


💯


I think that's a big factor, yeah. $450 starting price instead of $329 is a gigantic gulf. A 30% price increase across generations was just too big a leap.


I know other people are complaining about too many options, but I just want a cheap iPad SE basically.

I don't need the latest features or form factor to watch movies. The price is just too high now for me to consider the base iPad.


Apple? Lower the price? 

Like North Pole and South Pole


yep its this.  its not gotten to expensive for schools to buy the latest bottom model and also harder to justify for your kids.


That base iPad is still around though, no?


Idk why they even split ios and ipados. All the split is doing is ipados gets ios features one year later lol. And stage manager, which sucks.


This 👆🏻. The lack of proper file system, the lack of access to a terminal and the closed AppStore centric model is  why I think iPad os will never be able to compete on real pro workflows


At that point why not just support macOS with a different desktop environment? It uses literally the same chip. That’s the dream.


they should just put macOS on it. it already the same architecture and unironically macOS is closer to being touch friendly than windows because the trackpad gesture are so good.


Normal people don’t care about any of this


Yep, my M1 Pro is a youtube and facetime machine too.


The reality is ... most people actually want a Macbook Pro with a touch screen, not an iPad with MacOS.


I thought that's why folks got ipads really. I wouldn't do anything serious om it, because like you said it isn't really that capable. It's already a small form factor which takes away from more productive tasks, but pair that with no full fledged OS and no proper file manager involved om top of tons of other limitations and an iPad is just an expense streaming device for most people. 

By the time you buy an iPad and then get the $300 magic keyboard that tons of folks fork out it is already around the laptop price anyhow that is waaaaaay more capable and has way better physical components like a proper keyboard. Outside of niche stuff most folks won't do and maybe cat vids/social media it just isn't an enticing device to me over the alternative. I even run windows on my Mac and folks can get a Mac on sale for $750-$799 VERY OFTEN. I advise most to prioritize the laptop vs a tablet for those types of reasons. Ipad is just something I'd only get an older gen on a VERY good sale on, because I'd probably just use sidecar and maybe stream on it at best.


I love my M1


I've noticed this. Had a friend purchase an iPad air(2022) recently, and I have the the 2020 pro model and we compared our iPads... besides some slight physical features, they both perform quite the same. The air runs the M1 and my iPad pro runs A12Z bionic. At the time of purchase, my pro model was only about $80 cheaper than the newest Air with the same storage capacity (128gb), but what stands out? They are both extremely similar to each other... besides the processor.


Didn't they just port a bunch of pro apps


Get an actual laptop if you want to do anythijg serious. Ipads are basically just gimped devices made for kids or anyone that doesn't do much at all besides a car video or social media. That's about it for the most part. Considering you can easily spend at or more than an air while doing way less I personally just go with a laptop and already get all that stuff and not reward the nonsense of the gimp.


It’s too big and heavy for reading books too. They should consider making 8” ipads premium devices instead of relegating them to Minis with shittier screens.


ipad pro m2 11" STARTS at 1050€ where I live, how much higher do they think they can go..


This is why I’ve given up on the iPad. I love the idea of it. It’s super slick and feels like the future—sometimes. But most of the time it just feels pointlessly convoluted compared to my MBA. Having to poke at the screen is tiring, just as Jobs said, and super inconvenient. The Magic Keyboard is fine, but it’s just not the same as a laptop that can support its own weight and work at any angle. And the way you can’t just open apps in windows on the iPad to run several at once makes no sense anymore. On the iPhone, sure. But what is the point of the iPad if not to enable you to do *more* than your iPhone can?

Eventually I just got tired of all the limitations when doing work and the inconvenience of a device that I have to cradle exhaustingly or otherwise baby while I watch media compared to my MBA which I just plop down, set at the right angle and go. 

For as long as the iPad has been around, it’s kind of astounding they haven’t figured more of this out.


To reinvigorate the tablet market, you need to get tablets in the hands of everybody. Selling a $1500 pro tablet isn't going to reinvigorate anything, it's just get the high-end enthusiasts excited


Fuck having to re-buy a $250 keyboard case. That shit needs to be backwards compatible.


don't forget the Magic Keyboards currently cost $349 usd for the bigger model. It is an infuriating price for a keyboard accessory, mostly because it is just so damn good.


Yeah. Even if they stop getting iPadOS updates you can still use the latest version of the app for several more years before your iPad becomes truly obsolete.


Last forever? LOL Battery will die, software and processor will be obsolete. A MacBook or PC will last way longer


Do yourself a favor and get the laptop instead if you're spending that kind of money. Way more capable overall and a much better value. Especially when you factor in the $300 magic keyboard and the fact you can get an air for $750 on sale. ipad is an afterthought vs the laptop when it comes to value.

Any decent table is amazing at that. My Kindle blows at at that! Lacking a decent tablet, I use my Dell 2in1 loaded with Bluestacks for comics and such. Works great except for the weight. Maybe I'll steal my wife's iPad for comics reading...


I was searching for a tablet to read comics on (as my current android one 6 years old at this point)

I was intrigued by the iPad, then I realized Tachiyomi didn't exist on the iPad...I cant believe such a top tier, open source comic reading app isnt available on iPad OS, I had to settle for an Android


Because money sadly. If you noticed, apps are way more expensive on the AppStore compared to Google play or on web, also apps are encouraged to add subscriptions. If sideloading came out it would ruin all of that. Thank god the EU is forcing Apple to add sideloading but Apple has the power restrict it to only EU


> That M2 chip is literally a dog on a leash if it only utilizes the App Store but doesn’t allow outside developers to unlock the capabilities of a blazingly fast touch screen tablet.

I'm very strongly in favor of sideloading but the App Store isn't the problem here. Most of the restrictions are enforced by the OS and the kernel. Allowing side loading wouldnt magically make it run Mac OS and neither would it magically make desktop-grade software appear.


YES! I have a 2020 iPad Pro. I love it but it is just too big to carry around.

I too am waiting for an iPad mini with Apple Silicon chipset.


I had already began to feel that Apple’s hardware across the board is being gimped in some fashion by software.


lol, there's plenty of reasons besides drawing. you just aren't taking advantage of them


Exactly. They should continue to iterate and improve on iPadOS because putting macOS on an iPad would defeat the purpose of having a touch-friendly device. Just ask Windows 10 how trying to put these two paradigms together worked out - the tablet aspect of it sucked. 

iPadOS has a good UI - it just needs a few more tweaks and improvements to make it more desktop-like.


I agree MacOS on an iPad is a horrible idea, but iPadOS at the moment is clunky when trying to function similarly to macOS. I find myself tapping the screen more than using the trackpad.. that is the part I wish they would smooth out


Galaxy Tab s9 is 800 - 1200 bucks.


Wait it does. I use Fitness+ on my iPad all the time and it tracks with my watch?


Sadly FCP is a sub model now which really sucks. I have FCP on my mac book and paid once and wish they gave you that option on Ipad.

>It's amazing how many people want the ability to run full macOS or side load apps on an iPad, but as soon as iphone is mentioned it becomes blasphemy to want that on an iphone.

Maybe they're different groups of people? I'd be surprised if there was a lot of overlap here.

I bought a Pro in 2018 fully exprcting the software to be awesome by 2020.  It is still useless as anything but a consumption device.  If it dies, I may buy the $329 one for video and such, that price is fine.

But for the price an iPad Pro plus keyboard/trackpad, I can get a non-software gimped Macbook Air.  I’m honestly surprised they are still managing to sell any iPad Pros.


My litmus test: If I can't torrent on it without jumping through hoops (and/or there is a risk that those hoops will be closed later) then it's not for me.


I'll say, as someone who keeps looking at the iPad to replace my laptop, the reason I keep *not* pulling the trigger is lack of proper Firefox support. I want Firefox based on Gecko, not WebKit, so I can have all my regular extensions (like ublock origin).

Now that I have a Steam Deck, my laptop is basically a glorified email machine and general web browser. Both are tasks that the iPad would kill at, but at a fraction of the weight and size. But I don't want to have to use one of those two purposes as essentially being "Safari, reskinned as Firefox". The day Apple opens up iOS to alternative browser engines is probably the day I go buy an iPad (so long as Google continues to fumble the tablet format for the pixel brand).


Yep, the current iPad Pro is already more than powerful enough for my workflow, my workflow just isn’t possible on it.


Yeah the M-series chips are already serious overkill.  What I would like to have is the ability to use a split keyboard on the god damned iPad pro I spent a thousand bucks on, which you already implemented, and  just disable for users who bought the more expensive device.  Fucking ridiculous.  

Or let me use sidecar in portrait mode.


For me, an OLED or MiniLED with HDR would be a big upgrade for the 11” IPP. Media consumption, game streaming, etc. but other than that I’m not sure what I’d do with an M3 of all things…even my Mac mini is still on an intel processor and meets my needs!


What does “full ram” for one app even mean?


What does “full file explorer support” mean? There is the Files app…


Same software


It’s been muddled for nearly a decade now. I still think it should be iPad / iPad Pro (2 sizes), but I understand their pricing ladder strategy.


It's really not, you buy the one in your budget range.

They're all functionally the same at the end of the day, and you just get more extras the more you spend.


I of course would have a hardware wishlist (who wouldn’t!) but overall, my M1 iPad Pro has spectacular hardware. 


It’s similarly-specced to my M1 Mac mini, yet the Mac mini is a far more capable machine. 


That discrepancy is almost entirely due to software. 


If my M1 iPad changed into Mac OS mode when docked in its Magic Keyboard, it might just be my favorite Mac ever, even with only 1 USB-C port for I/O.


As it stands now, it’s not nearly as useful to me as I had hoped. I don’t think I will buy another iPad Pro unless they go back to the drawing board for iPadOS. They’re trying to shoehorn in Mac features into iOS, and it shows.


> Not enough ram to do true multitasking if it  was enabled by the OS.

You’re huffing glue. Current gen pro has 8-16GB RAM depending on storage.


a driving school?


Stage Manager is possibly the most worthless software demo I have ever seen.  Maybe I'm not their target demo but I use the iPad a fair amount and SM looked incredibly unappealing to me.


I’ve never once used it. It never occurs to me that I should. I played with it a bit when they first launched it. But it just isn’t that intuitive and it doesn’t add much value when it does work.


Well, I’m a bit old for a kid, but I find iPads to be great entertainment devices around the house. Great for movies/YouTube in the kitchen or in the tub. In design, we also use them for digital sketching, and corporate is perpetually interested in using them for AR since they provide a much larger viewport than iPhones, while also incorporating Lidar and Apple’s ARKit.


I buy the cheapest ipad every few years and trade in my old one to use as a second TV and airplane entertainment. I watch it while working out in the basement and download netflix or other shows on it to watch while flying so i don't have to pay for wifi or a more expensive plan


That’s what the speaker is for: kids in restaurants blasting their videos.


My 65 year old mom uses an iPad exclusively and has since 2010. She never used computers before this.


Use mine pretty much exclusively. Only pull out my laptop when I need office-type apps.


I think they’re pretty popular among students


[deleted]


I just bought the cheapest iPad Pro i could find and slapped jump desktop on it. I now effectively have a *MacBook Air M1 Pro 11* with touch screen, since I use it that way 90% of the time lol

Bonus is I can attach a big ass external drive to my mac, leave it at home on my desk and have tons of space without paying the extra for a large SSD on either an iPad or a Macbook


I use the ipad mini regularly as a digital notebook. Also as a journalist it’s much easier running around with my research and sources on a handheld, rather than a small phone or a full laptop, but that seems to be a more niche use case. Same goes for having my audio recorder for interviews built into my notebook. I think for someone going paperless it’s really nice with the pencil, but for your average person whose not writing, editing and reading documents it’s much less useful.


The issue isn't tablets in general, they're *fantastic* and highly affordable devices for media consumption at home or for note-taking.  

The problem is that the niche of people who need anything much more than a base iPad, is basically limited to small groups like artists.  For 99% of people, the most affordable iPad they can buy will set them up for years.

Tablets are basically where phones would be right now, if it weren't for the ability to sell new models based on fancier cameras.


Kids and grandparents.


They are everywhere in work/enterprise settings.  Although some folks have gotten wise and started rolling out bespoke android devices because even with all that asspain its cheaper than iPads.


I use an iPad pro for art. That's about all it's good for


Agreed. I love the idea of an iPad, but every time I’ve owned one I ask why I own it. There isn’t any additional functionality I can’t get from my phone, in fact there’s even less. I mean..still no IG for iPad? Without better “pro” OS options, I can’t quite figure out what I’d use one for.


[deleted]


You and 5 other people, Apple’s target demo.


Same but then I’m sure would technically make MacBook Air and 13inch MacBook Pro obsolete. Or seriously cut into their sales.


My iPad is a work powerhouse. In construction…it’s so useful. Pro 12.9 with Magic Keyboard, and my truck has a hot spot. Plans. Scopes. Bids. Contracts. Sales decks. Zoom meetings. 

I prefer my desk, because 2x 32” screens. But I can work literally anywhere and coordinate so easily with everyone I have to work with. Without the keyboard being required.


I work in tech. I love my iPad Pro. I use it far more often than my MacBook and PC because I like having the touchscreen and the ability to undock and write and draw on it. It’s the perfect combination of lightweight, versatility, battery life, and speed. My partner (also in tech) feels the same way about hers.


I drop my iPhone 13 in the charger when I get home from work, and then pick up my iPad Mini 6 for the rest of the night. I love it.


I imagine there is at least one user out there who seriously needs to render Final Cut videos a few seconds faster but has a bad that is just slightly too narrow to fit a MacBook Pro


Deff students. Its a powerhouse for note taking. Love mine for professional school. Also simple work emails


Professionals transported large volumes of contract documents between offices. Professionals taking large volumes of documents with them on business trips. Giving presentations. Artists, especially David Hockney, who has used an iPad for years. Designers, Planners, Students, Photographers, people doing real work,  General education, General office use, Restaurants, point of sake terminals and, of course, kids in restaurants.


Great for design and product work.

But yes I’ll take one Mac OS too plz.


I use it as a teacher. I lecture and give notes and draw on it and have it project to the students. I encourage my students to get one so that they can take notes and record audio at the same time, or do it in college.


I don’t see why the keyboard accessories exists. iPad is great for pen and content consumption and that’s about it.


Excel on iPad is how villains are made.


Ofc it is up to Adobe and developers, the thing is, its exactly the same hardware as the Macbook so it should be capable of running the same version but Apple wants developers to put it extra work and design a separate app. For sure the iPad Pro market share is quite small thus not many devs willing to invest into making separate apps.


Probably.  But maybe it’s memory related.  I know there’s different allowances on iPad. Vs Mac.


I suspect what people actually want is a MacBook Air with a detachable screen, that runs iPad OS when it’s un-docked, and MacOS when docked.


[ipads aren't better at anything!](https://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/cdz6k/steve_jobs_the_problem_is_netbooks_arent_better/)


2 years?! I gave up after 2 days


I've only ever bought the base model iPad because I know I only really use it for media consumption, the occasional email, and occasional sketching. Any time I've tried to use it for "real" work, I've always found it extremely limiting and found myself wishing the software could do more. 

I've had students try to use an iPad Pro as their main computing device, and it's been an absolute failure every time.


Have you seen the price of an iPad Pro lately? It's practically in MacBook territory already.


I believe Apple is putting a throttle on iPadOS for not cannibaling MacBook.


They could literally run macOS in some sort of “docked” mode. Have a “macOS app” that requires external mouse and keyboard.  The only thing they’d need to do is find a way to do a shared filesystem and it’d be done.


It's more fruitful to let the iPad simply run macOS. 

1. macOS will automatically provide the iPad with (almost) all desired software features. I suspect that adapting macOS for the iPad is easier and more straightforward than building up iPadOS to replace macOS. Given the historical progression of iPadOS, the latter will apparently take an indeterminate amount of time, and there's no guarantee that it will support your favorite app or feature. 
2. macOS can run—in theory—all iPad apps, so as long as Apple adds iPad-specific apps like SpringBoard to macOS, there is no loss of features when using macOS compared to iPadOS. 

Gurman claims that the 2024 iPad Pros will have a new Magic Keyboard that "look\[s\] even more like a laptop than the current setup." If Apple is trying to make the iPad Pro a laptop replacement, then it needs to run macOS. If Apple isn't going in that direction, then why does every iPad Pro external keyboard look closer to a laptop than the last one?


Files app cant even handle large PDF’s, must open ibooks lol


Which features do you want?

I’m trying to figure out what it is that people want from the iPad. It does what I want it to do for the most part. I mean, I’d like to be able to record and use effects in Garage Band or Logic Pro while I have MuseScore open, but I’m not sure that’s an iPad problem overall. 

The one thing I can’t do on the iPad that I can do on my Mac is code. And honestly, that’s why I have an MBP.

careful... if you mention side loading, the legion of "normal" users might downvote your post, say you are not a normal user, and that you should switch to an android phone.


ipad replaced my computer for everything I do besides work. mostly chess. and reading and writing. I don't think i've actually taken my laptop anywhere in years


Windows surface laptops are realy just tablets with windows on it. You can call it a laptop, but being real it's a tablet. So they exist. I don't care for tablets period and they're overrated imo for anything serious. Not to mention they're way more limited both physically and software wise in general. I prefer actual laptop's anyhow. Those tablets tend to suck for any screen space anyhow. When you have some serious work to get done you don't want your standard tablet screen size anyhow. Just give me the laptop. 

Tablet sounds nice for travel, but eh, my 13 inch is fine and I just am in no hurry nor feel any need to ever buy one outside of maybe for a kid.


>Yep. 2018 iPad Pro here and the years keep passing, but I have no reason to upgrade. I WANT a reason to upgrade, but there just hasn't bee one.

Yeah, the only reason I upgraded my 2018 is that it was having problem with drawing programs. If you're not doing that, I don't think there's a lot of reason yet.


I have used mine for the AR stuff. It’s a game changer for buying stuff and seeing what it looks like at your location.


I just want to be able to use my iPad Pro as an Apple Pencil!


Yeah it’s not just that people are stressed from literally everything in their life taking a cost leap too far. Let’s face it the iPad is literally a luxury at this point and I’d imagine a lot of people are aiming to get their kid a cheaper tablet


I wouldn't mind if it didn't have a camera. I think I've taken less than twenty photos on mine.


See, this is the problem. Which iPad should I buy?
They are selling an iPad (9th gen) AND iPad (10th gen)…WTH!


I waited months because it was too late in the cycle to buy, and instead of new stuff for the same price... I can't even get the previous model for cheaper. Bonus: Apple Pencil charging is differently wacky, and still only supports the old one.


Stage Manager, especially on iPadOS 17, is great


>Idk why they even split ios and ipados.

They wanted to push iPad OS toward merging with MacOS. However, the experience of a desktop operating system on a tablet has never really come together and Apple won't merge the two until it is.


macOS is not totally touch friendly though.


MacOS with a different desktop environment and iPadOS that lets you run apps from outside the App Store are basically the same thing.


The reason they don’t is they know it’ll hurt mac sales


What makes you think this?


Who’s they? Nobody has ported full desktop apps over. I tried, and really wanted to use iPad Pro as a laptop replacement. Gave up after 2 years


Besides streaming video, ipad is aamazing for students who take notes.  Way better workflow and less stuff to carry when you can carry ur ipad


IMHO they are completely priced out of market. My 2017 iPad was around 7xx Euro new back then which was already a huge step over the normal iPad  but the build quality/performance justified it for me.

I truly don't understand current Apple's price and product strategy with these products. If you add the overpriced keyboard to it it gets ridiculous. Do (all) of these Pro models also need the sophisticated and probably more expensive camera?


As long as people pay that much, they will increase the prices.

12" M2 iPad Pro starts at 1449€ here and the smaller 11" also at 1049€. Lots of money for such a powerful, yet software-wise handicapped device.

It seems the me they want to make sure that the iPad is still clearly separated from the Mac, software-wise.


all I want is a basic iPad but with a 120hz screen. Seems like they'll restrict that to the higher models sadly.

I find 60Hz unbearable on touch screens now


Not ready to give up on it by any means but I share much of the same frustration. The power is there but there always seems to be unnecessary constraints around what apps can and can’t do. Files being an app vs part of the OS is a major issue for me since some apps don’t seem to play nice there and the process of even the most basic action saving a document can get convoluted. Not being able to install fonts is another one. Small things that add up really fast.


Same as me. 100%. Tried iPad Pro M1 with Magic Keyboard for 2 years. Gave up. It’s nowhere close to a MacBook when trying to get work done without issues


I understand why real power users/developers might want the ability to run MacOS on these iPads for convenience/coolness reasons.

But why a normal user would need that I don't really get. The usability/efficiency of these device is so different which limits/defines their usage for most.

P.S. iPad's storage system might not survive MacOS's IO requirements long due swapfile writes. Personally I would never even consider a 256 or even 512GB MacBook because of their lower write lifetime and fixed ssd.


It’s not that good


My son used my 2013 iPad until this year. It did the job. 

I finally replaced it because I couldn’t download the latest software and beer apps required it.


So do most iPhones. It’s still not a computer replacement.


Ugh. I though that too. Getting an iPad Pro and insisting on using it for two years as my main computer was a HUGE mistake


Haha I was exaggerating a bit, I do other stuff like khan academy, duolingo, goofing off with freeform. But still, I’d say well over half my time on an iPad is reading comics. I rarely if ever buy physical comics now. I use DCUI for superhero stuff and buy my others from Amazon/Comixology.


iPad mini already has Apple silicon. Do you mean M series chips? Because I doubt it will get that


I have an older iPad maybe that’s why mine won’t work.


Oh right I forgot about the apple pen. I feel like that's useful for notes and drawing and stuff


Customary r/Apple: "why do you need 6gb, didn't you know Apple does memory management?"


MKBHD is less involved with rumored products and more about newly released products. Apples and Oranges.


Totally agree, if it could do
More computer things i would use my ipad pro more but as of late its basically a n expebsive netflix machine


Same. I also occasionally run pretty obscure and specialized technical software and you can still have backwards compatibility for old software if you know what to do. A PC is practically the entire world of computer application, an iPad Pro is still just a tiny fraction of that.


Honestly that's why I am kind of skeptical about Vision Pro.  As a dev, it's an awesome idea for an interface, but the fact that it's going to be hamstrung by software instead of being an actual open computer makes me think I won't have much use for it.


Unpopular opinion: I feel like the regular iPad is already powerful enough for 90% of people. There just aren’t that many apps that take advantage of the full horsepower m2 offers


Why is your workflow not possible on it? It can do everything from video editing to mail writing


Yeah, them removing split keyboard is literally nuts.  It’s pretty much the only way to type more than a sentence without killing your neck or hands


The possibility to let one application use all RAM, that is free. Apple limits RAM to one app, they have set the limit way higher a year for Apple M iPads, but still there is a limit and no swap, like on windows and linux. And Apple kills apple in background kinda fast, so rendering a video in background while watching netflix/youtube, reading artricle is impossible.


I’m not sure why you’re getting downvotes, it’s a legit question. I’m able to use Files. It’s a little bit tricky but the files are there. I usually put new stuff on the desktop and clean everything up on the Mac and it’s there across the rest of my devices.


I agree 100%. 


My Mac LC in 1991 did multitasking with 4 MB of RAM. Granted, it was Classic Mac OS multitasking, but it worked—arguably more usefully than present-day iPadOS. 


As for true multitasking, my iMac in 2001 ran OS X with 64 MB of RAM and could multitask. 


So the idea of an 8,192 MB iPad not being able to multitask just doesn’t ring true to me. 


It’s the OS, and always has been. Apple needs to make Mac OS touch-compatible and bring it to the iPad, at least on the Pros in docked mode.


And my MacBook Pro has 32gb and still struggles editing videos.


It's more that Apple took something from the Vision Pro and slapped it on iPad OS without much regard for how it works on that platform. 

I wish they had gone with a normal desktop there rather than reinvent the wheel.


I’ve tried it paired up with a 4k screen… it’s just odd. I don’t get what the heck they are trying to do. for sure not intuitive.


Yeah, I've gotten to the point where I only use my iPad on flights to watch movies. And it's amazing for that purpose.

But now airlines are finally rolling out bluetooth audio for their in-flight entertainment systems so I might stop traveling with it if I can just use my wireless headphones to watch the movies they're already offering.


I also only ever buy the cheapest iPad. Best value for dollar (ever version above the base is still an iPad) and least loss when I go to resell it. 

Also fewer tears if someone breaks it.


Why not use your phone for this


Same for my parents yeah, 67 both of them. My dad has used computers since the 90s but my mom has never been a computer user. They both now exclusively use an iPad rather than laptops.

The average person frankly does not "need" a full-fledged laptop in their day to day lives. I'd guess that something like 80% of consumers (maybe more) basically *only* use their personal computers to access a web browser plus some additional functions that probably *could* be done in a web browser like word processing and PDF reading.


Personally I see more MacBook's than iPad's.


My school got me the latest iPad Pro, I used it for a year then sold it for a 2 year old basic iPad. Have not noticed a single real world difference.


This is why I prefer Samsung tablets. Dex makes it comparable to the computer experience.


Tablets like the S9 are so good but their support and lifespan is so shit for something that's $800+


Doesn't get better than $250 for the base ipad


are you being intentionally obtuse?

you can both think that macOS is being made worse with the shoehorning of iOS conventions into it and that the iPad would benefit immensely by having it as an operating system.

in fact both of these criticism fall in the same spectrum of iOS being the issue...


People on this subreddit legitimately think this


Nice try Tim Apple.


Apple is actually trying to unify the programming language used across all its platforms ie SwiftUI. I imagine Adobe have barely updated to using objective C.


That would be nice. Look at the success of the Surface. They sell Ike hotcakes on the Windows side and do an okay job for average consumers. It is the ARM version of windows, but still fairly fledged out and capable of running x64 applications really well overall actually. Hell, I run the ARM version on my Mac of windows and it's fucking shocking how well they pulled it off. I thought apps wouldn't work if it wasn't made specifically for ARM windows and my surprise, it was like butter and that's on a VM.

Mac goes put of its way to resist many things even if practical many times though. I don't support devices until they bring something the alternatives don't already do in a major way and at minimum have a price difference that would make at  least a little ore enticing. As long as yall keep buying regardless apple has no incentive to change or care. Something tells me apple isn't gonna go toe to toe with the surface in the ual mode deal though unfortunately despite being proven to sell well...


People on this sub have suggested in the past that there should be some kind of "Pro Mode" option in settings to switch to a more desktop-like OS.

So then people who just want the simplicity of iPadOS can have it and people can switch back and forth as needed.


I know… I regret insisting on it


Bro, I went all in. Magic Keyboard case, iPad Pro M1, even bought a mouse, stands for it. After 2 years, sold it all and will not look back… the 120hz, fluidity of the OS was good, but I love having Mac OS at my disposal more. It’s just so much more mature as an OS


Most suspect this. But IPP has reached the price point of Mac. Why hold it back at this point. Let customers choose the form factor.


Agreed, a fully loaded iPad Pro 12.9” is only $100 less than a fully loaded MacBook Air 15”.. giving it a full version of macOS would probably just turn a lot of people towards an iPad. 

In my opinion they should either give people the option to use macOS or just straight up replace the MacBook Air with the iPad Pro, probably make more money this way since people would be more inclined to buy the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. 

I know personally I’d buy the iPad in a heartbeat if it had at least 90% of macOS features.


[deleted]


Exactly! Make it something like Samsung's Dex or Microsoft's Continuum. Plugged into a keyboard, you could get a prompt asking if you want to work with MacOS, unplug it, then you're back to iPadOS. The hard drives are so big, you could have both installed.


iPadOS applications are sandboxed and distributed solely by Apple who take their 30% cut. Adding MacOS to iPads would throw away that revenue. It’s literally why they fight so much against sideloading. Apple would rather make MacOS more like iPadOS rather than the opposite but can’t due to the precedent on development and distribution set by PCs and Macs since the 80s.


My theory about the iPad is that Apple was slowly building out ipadOS to be a full replacement for consumer usage of macOS. 

This would benefit Apple because if they sold someone an iPad Pro instead of a MacBook Air it would mean they would get App Store revenue on that device. 

But then I think they shifted tons of resources to Vision Pro.


It’s never ever going to run MacOS.

Each OS of Apple’s is built around a single primary interface: MacOS is for keyboard and trackpad, iOS is for handheld touch, tvOS is for remotes, and iPadOS is for touch and, increasingly, pencil input.

This is really useful, as developers have just one kind of interface to target for a platform. I don’t want Mac apps on my iPad, I want apps that are built for touch and pencil on my iPad.

The more you blur these lines, the more barriers you erect for development and ease of use.

We saw this happen with Windows 8, it was a total shit show.


Not gonna happen. I personally find iPad way too small for more serious tasks anyway and always thought that folks using an iPad aren't typically doing anything labor intensive. Typically they're just watching a video or drawing picture. I personally would never get played like that where you spend at or more on an iPad than you do an actual laptop. 

Ipads are basically just less performant luxury items that primarily do extremely basic tasks as folks that get em wouldn't for anything serious due to limitations. I thought about getting a cheap older gen one for no more than $200-$300 bucks **max**, but am in no rush. If they did put macos on it it would definitely be more intriguing, but they won't any time soon so I have no respect for ipads for anything actually serious.


I do web development and have a MBP and iPad pro, I’d love to be able to code on the go with a Magic Keyboard and iPad then undock and use the iPad in typical tablet form. That would require opening up the file system more and better multitasking. This would essentially become what the Microsoft surface pro is which I used to own and loved but that ran full windows 10


> Which features do you want?
> 
> I’m trying to figure out what it is that people want from the iPad.

The ability to actually easily multitask.  The ability to manage windows easily. 

The ability to have and see the files on my computer without jumping through crazy hoops.


I’m still in awe of this take, Time Machine aside I just can’t agree, the old version was so much worse for discoverability and the new search is a huge help


I thought this was sarcastic at first, and then I realized you were serious.


haha. But I mean even without side loading, you can't even develop iOS apps on an iPad Pro. That's like the most low hanging fruit for Apple, I'm sure all those billions in cash could afford some development on Xcode for iPad. But we don't even get that.


Not me. I prefer the laptop. I can simply do so much more on an actual laptop with a better keyboard, build, etc. I never have to worry about being able to get shit done and it's a small enough FF nowadays. I don't want to ever worry about being able to get shit done. 

I find folks that don't do much anyhow will be fine with a tablet or really just a phone at that point. Tablets just aren't yhat great at anything more than a cat video or email.


I’m so glad I got a Surface Pro instead of an iPad Pro as my portable device.  It’s just way more valuable to me to have a full OS than something that’ll also connect to iMessage


Did you miss where I said a different desktop environment?


One of the great historical strengths about Apple is their willingness to cannibalize their own sales when a better option comes along: see the Apple II, the Lisa, the iPod mini. 


They have buried their heads in the sand for years when it comes to touch-enabling the Mac OS, and the lack of power in iPadOS. 


A dual mode tablet has been done before. I know Apple can do it better—and probably in a way that benefits both the Mac and the iPad.


I think the person you're replying to is referring to the recent releases of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for the iPad.


I'd still advise a laptop over a tablet for most students. You can still take great notes on it, but actually have a full fledged OS on it with a fledged file manager (iPad doesn't), better specs for all types of projects available, better keyboard which you will need to write papers and projects, ability to run windows (which is extremely important in school often since somethings require or is a fuck ton easier on an actual laptop/windows), is already extremely light to the point that it is practically nothing in the bag with an M1 air only literally a couple of pounds, takes up very little space, and will be more capable period across way more types of assignments and use cases. 

It literally can do just about anything the tablet can do, but the tablet cannot do anywhere near the same the laptop can do. I'd prioritize an actual laptop for most students and only if you have extra money (most college students are poor) would I look into an expensive iPad. It will outlast any iPad due to all the things mentioned and is expensive so you want longevity.


When I was in university I HATED the iPad even though my studies only ever required me to write loads of essays (so main use was word processing only). Everything was clunky and takes more steps to complete than a laptop. Went back to my MBA and never looked back.


You make a great point. The Pro is already far more expensive than its peers (not that it has any true peers), but the Magic Keyboard is an obscene $350 more. 

I can’t see any scenario where I would buy the upcoming pro and Magic Keyboard rather than a more useful, more powerful MacBook.


ProMotion will always be restricted to the Pro devices. It's literally in the name.


Battery life is pretty bad with 120hz


you can install fonts but its actually a trash fire of an implementation... like its actually amazingly stupid


[deleted]


Same. Outside of the rare graphic novel, my comics purchases have been digital for years.


Apple Silicon is what Apple uses to describe all of their M series chipsets.

They also use ARM variants (A series) on other products (like iPhones).

These are two distinct chipsets. Apple Silicon is designed by and manufactured for Apple. The other chipsets that Apple uses are licensed ARM chipsets that Apple custom designs for their needs.

ARM is fixing to go public soon with an IPO.


Because I still have Safari tabs open from 2018


the iPad 10th Gen still only has 4 gigs welp.


It could be a genuine Mac replacement, but unfortunately its software is close to iPadOS.


This isn’t an unpopular opinion, it’s the truth.


I’m a software developer


>Apple kills apple in background

true


Because Apple doesn't want apps to ruin user-experience and slowdown the OS. If you want that, get a Windows.


Current / modern-ish macos needs \~4-8gb of memory to work and be usable, and has since \~2010 or so. Mostly has to do w/ macos's WindowManager process and the need to keep a high resolution framebuffer in memory for repaint for each window. Have more than a trivial number of windows open and that'll eat up a gigabyte of ram or two by itself. Also, the macos kernel / kexts loves to eat up memory (mostly for caching file I/O, iirc), and will happily eat up another 1-2 gigs, or more.

Running out of ram is ofc mostly NBD thanks to virtual memory / paging, but if your window manager wants to touch the framebuffer of *every* window you have open when you, say, open expose, that *will* noticeably slow the system / device down due to paging, and look / feel janky as hell.

Outside of that, yes, ipad pros could trivially run macos *and are using the same exact hardware* as the mx macs at this point.

The issue (afaik) is apple's shitty ipados fork of darwin, lack of resources / interest in significantly improving / adding onto ipados (and/or just switching the ipad pros to run macos, period). The base model (and legacy) ipads couldn't really run a full macos desktop environment though, courtesy of 2-4 gb of ram.

To be clear though, *all* apple operating systems use multitasking and multithreading, and are the *same exact* unix OS running on mach / darwin under the hood.

The difference is the user-mode developer APIs apple gives to you, restrictions on process management and system calls (eg. restricting the amount of memory a process can allocate on ios), and a bunch of app siloing / security and power throttling features that apple built for ios, and that were more or less cloned (or at least have very close equivalents) on android.

Funny enough, any iphone is *probably* running a more complete and less restricted / hacked together BSD unix implementation under the hood than any android device is, *technically.* But ofc neither users nor developers / apps have access to any of that (or nearly any of that) on ios et al, thanks to a lack of a unix / BSD userland\*. Or more specifically a BSD / unix userland that apps, *and/or the user*, can use. AFAIK much of that is *still* *there*, just not accessible by anything other than iOS internals et al.

\* ie. a shell, and everything in `/usr` et al. A bash shell *probably* isn't there (though honestly, who knows), but a lot of other core components *probably* / almost certainly are


My man that has nothing to do with "true multitasking".


Probably because editing videos isn't *just* RAM limited.


It makes as little sense on Mac OS. iPads are on M line APUs. Just let us run native Mac OS already.  No excuse to not allow a dual boot.


it's more the choice of content. airline content is almost always PG-13 or lower and they are behind on the seasons. I flew overseas and back a few weeks ago and finished up Silo and almost caught up on S2 of Foundation. Would have watched Ahsoka but Disney wouldn't work in the country I visited. they had ST Discovery S1 but not S2


Phone small.


I'm almost AARP age and need reading glasses. and too small to watch it from 10 feet away in my home gym. between the trade in values and the veteran's discount it's pretty cheap to buy every few years.

&#x200B;

and it's thin and light


I guess it depends on the studies. Engineering/maths is easier with a pencil than a keyboard


Screen size 🤷‍♂️


Yeah, my wife's old MacBook Air finally gave up the ghost and we were looking for a replacement. She already has a work computer so 90% of what she does on her home computer is passive, so I thought I'd just get her an iPad instead. 

Turns out a Samsung Tablet is about a third of the price and you can expand the memory with an SD card. It's been a while since I owned a tablet but I'm kind of wondering who the iPad is marketed towards. "It's almost as expensive as a full computer, without a full OS"?


For a while you could run a full desktop OS (Linux on DeX) on certain Samsung hardware


Eh,, my issue with both iPad and Dex is not the interface but how they still run mobile apps instead of desktop (talking about functionality). Granted, Android is much better in this regard, but still behind, say, Linux with touch-oriented DE - which is essentially what I want iPad Pro OS to be.


[deleted]


Colin Robinson vibes right here.


I have no idea why anyone thinks a UI that was *clearly* developed for a mouse is somehow appropriate for a tablet? Does no one here remember why the windows tablet/phone failed?


I almost bought a Surface Pro a few years ago. An Apple version of that kind of functionality would be amazing.


Not "pro mode", anything short of straight up macos falls short. 

To do professional work, you often need some kind of proprietary software, even if it's just a one off. People won't compromise when it comes to doing the stuff that makes them their money. 

What you've described is perfect if the pro mode is just macos. Everything else will eventually come up short.


Because they want you to buy them both. It’s obvious by how the ecosystem features work between all the apple devices. They don’t want you to buy one versatile product, instead they want you to buy all of the handicapped products which offer the complete experience in tandem. iPad is the most guilty of this, it has a sim/5g capability so that it can replace you need for a iPhone if you don’t value the form factor, has a display big enough where productivity is feasible on it, has performance rivaling some desktop processors but apple just chooses to ship it with a ass operating system.


Maybe Macs have a better margin?


Because with the current approach, most people who are getting an iPad aren’t doing it as a mac replacement, they’re getting both. If you can replace your mac with an iPad, that will just translate to an overall reduction in device sales.


Because then macbook air would lose everytime to a touch screen equivalent that only needs a detachable keyboard (IF thats your usecase)

Edit: I hate IPP aspect ratio though. So id personally choose MB A/P if I were to choose again today


Once iPad start competitions with Macs then it’s gonna open this pandora box. Like…why don’t the pro MacBook have a touchscreen etc etc


> giving it a full version of macOS would probably just turn a lot of people towards an iPad.

Potentially, but I think the lack of ports will always (or at least for another decade) keep laptops more attractive to anyone not using their device purely for entertainment or drawing purposes. Aka anyone in audio production, video editing (heavy editing with third party plugins, not FC for iPad), etc.

Plus obviously MacOS's current functionality wouldn't be amazing as is on a touchscreen.


> I know personally I’d buy the iPad in a heartbeat if it had at least 90% of macOS features.

Okay, but you aren't everyone.  I type on my laptop all day.  That's all I do for work.  I carry it in and out of rooms. 

Ipad is bad for that use-case.  Worse keyboard and heavier and thicker with the case. 

Same for people that use it only on their desk.  No advantages to ipad. 

Yes, there are a lot of people (students mainly) that could use a tablet and inking and only occasionally type on it.  That is the surface crowd... and that is a big market.  I loved my surface, it got me through med school.

But don't pretend that it's for everyone.


True but that when Steve Jobs was still leading the company. I don’t think it’s still the same with the current leadership team.

Under Steve’s supervision, Apple will never release half baked impractical products like Apple Vision Pro.


At the rate they are doing this maybe ipadOS will be at parity with macos in 30 years.



>It’s never ever going to run MacOS.

Just like there will never be a pen for iOS?


> We saw this happen with Windows 8, it was a total shit show.

Yea, including the Windows Server OS which had the stupid 'metro' touch interface enabled by default.

Powershell has come a long way but back then there were often no options but connect remote to the GUI and it *sucked*


You know a lot of professional artists use iPads as their main work device right? It would be amazing to have a better workflow on it.


I need a touch device with pen input. I would like to leave my laptop at home while traveling but I can’t because iPad doesn’t support terminal, code editors, electron apps etc. I wish I could dual boot Linux/macOS on my iPad Pro.


I’m unconvinced that this is as good of a use case as you present it to be. Quite simply, I don’t code on the go. If I’m on the go, I’m likely set up to do other work tasks, or alternately, I’m explicitly not coding to give my brain a rest. 

Then again, I’m used to coding on much more than a 12 inch screen, and I don’t even want to try. The most coding I’ll use my iPad for is some Sidecar action when I’m doing exercises on new languages (right now, I’m picking up Go for work and Rust to be able to fix problems I’m having with Linux on my M1 Max). 

I personally think it’s fine that the iPad doesn’t work as a coding system. What’s more, you don’t need nearly as much file system access as you seem to think: my Linux box has my development environment entirely sequestered from the filesystem. It can’t access files outside its own image.


It can do all of those already though? Stage Manager lets you multitask and easy manage windows (iPadOS 17 makes it so that windows are *much* more customizable than 16, allowing you to change them to nearly any shape and place them wherever you’d like without them snapping to pre-defined places). 

And I don’t know what’s convoluted about opening the Files app and having it all right there.


Ok cool, but the average person isn’t doing anything crazy on a computer.

They use email, word/excel/pp, watch videos, browse the internet, play games, and use video chatting services.

A good tablet is great for all of those things, and easier/more convenient form factor than a laptop. It just is.


It's just the better deal. You got folks spending $300 dollars extra for a much lesser keyboard alone. The iPad simply can't fo what a Mac can. Why most folks would spend a shit ton on an iPad when it's just gonna be for basic shit is beyond me. You simply do not have the limits on the mac and nowadays with a 13in it's already small enough form factor to not even be a burden.


...in that case I think they are better iterating on iPadOS and making it more like macOS because iPadOS is already touch-friendly.


They’re not ports though, they’re limited versions


Then there’s no need to revamp it then.

And yes, I read the article.


Yeah exactly!  And it's extra frustrating, because it's got an M-series SOC inside, so it's more or less literally a mac with different interface hardware.

I mean Apple is free to do what they want, but it's a shame because it seems like no other vendor is close to being able to pull off what they are in terms of this kind of hardware on an open platform.

I guess *maybe* Valve is somewhere in the right ballpark and could release some kind of badass open Linux AR/VR workstation product.


You want to develop on a tiny screen? 

Does anybody remember Jobs talking about trucks and cars, with the tablet brung the car (general use) and PC bring the truck (specialist use). That’s what happened except with big phones and computers. Your use case needs a computer.


I fly Delta pretty regularly and they usually have a pretty solid mix of movies including independent and foreign ones. 

But I also tend to associate flying with Pixar movies for the reason you mentioned so I kinda look at it as my time to catch up on the latest from them, haha.


I'd rather watch a movie on my phone than bring a whole other device, just me.


And pencil functionality


For sure. It’s not ideal, but I find it a better experience than iPad OS in that regard.


Then those changes should be made to whatever version of MacOS they put on the ipad, no reason for a MacBook to be held back by it


Erm... No. iOS (and, in turn, iPadOS) is, indeed, based on MacOS, but it is very different in what it can do, allows apps to do, and how it all works under the hood. Interface, while being the most immediately obvious one, is one of the smallest differences between them.


I ageee it should be as capable as macOS but I assume the UI would need to be a bit different to accommodate the touch OS in both modes. So just macOS with a tweaked UI or something.


On point!


Best comment on this thread


I’d expect the market to expand though if they did do it, so more people would come over from the pc side, so that could make up for any lost sales of two devices. Perhaps some of those sales could be caught up by making MacOS available only on the Pro and then perhaps some people would still buy a regular iPad on the side? So two iPads for dual screen scenarios?


Agree, I'd prefer to just have google voice or some voip service and not use own a phone as I don't tend to use it. The camera is useful but I prefer the 11" screen on my M1/5G iPad to use than a small screen which I find stressful.

Equally, I can use Remote desktop software to log into my MacOS from my iPad but again I'd prefer to be able to flip between MacOS and iPadOs via  toggle or else use an AppleOS hybrid of the two.

As you predicted in the end I have iPhone, MBA and iPad but would prefer to just have iPad. There is some extra use that is positive from multiple devices eg phone for camera on the Go is easiest to take and use or MBA can have bigger screen, battery and use iPad as second screen at home or take with and oc iPad is excellent for reading books or doing art using touch at 460g or so is very nice to pick up and use/pack.

But overall if I could I'd pick iPad alone.


Yep - you only have to look to Sidecar for a perfect example of this. The iPad is being positioned - both literally and figuratively - as an accessory to use alongside the Mac.


Nah, once you buy the case for the iPad it’s as expensive as a Mac


Ehhh, maybe?

In the office I would want a macbook.  At home I would want a tablet.

They have different use-cases. Carrying around and typing on an ipad is a worse experience than a laptop.  Worse keyboard, heavier and thicker.


I think I would have taken the MB instead if I could go back as well.


I don't really want a touchscreen laptop to be honest. I hate fingerprints on screens and that drives me nuts all the time on my phone/iPad. I'm probably in the minority though.


I mean..why don’t they? Obviously we already know the answer. 
 
The point is the box is already opened.


I’d imagine anyone with the need for that much I/O and SoC horsepower would be purchasing a MacBook Pro.  My thinking is an iPad with macOS would target MacBook Air users not the Pro users.


Did I say it was for everyone? I literally said give us the OPTION


That’s a pretty different scenario. The criticism of a stylus originally was a lack of touch support.


You do realize I was talking about most people right? Not some super small subset of folks that is so small it becomes a super niche case at that point. It's not capable of anything majorly intensive really the way they gimp it. I literally already said drawing so that's art my guy. Still doesn't make it a great device outside of basic tasks. You realize most folks aren't artists right? It's a very gimped luxury device that doesn't have anywhere near the compacity a laptop has. It just doesn't. 

I doubt apple will do much anytime soon to change that either. I'm sticking to laptops until they actually do something non-basic.


I don't.  

Every professional I have seen drawing uses a surface product or a wacom... expressly for the "real" OS, and the size.

I see a few people mentioning that they can use a ipadpro it in a pinch, or while traveling... but the screen is just too small for serious art / draft work.

Just a plug here... but why in the world won't apple realease a surface studio like microsoft?  It would be amazing.


While going on short trips, my choices are either leave iPad at home and lose touch/pen and tablet convenience I absolutely love or leave laptop at home and lose ability to ssh into a remote server in an emergency. Or carry both which I’m not going to do. I returned my iPad Pro.


Doesn't matter what you do or say MacOS is still way more capable, will last longer, comes with keyboard already vs having to spend $200-$300 extra on subpar magic keyboard, is a fully fledged OS instead of a gimped one, has better longevity due to better specs and capabilities, can actually run multiple OS's which folks do need to do especially for work where windows is often neccesary, etc. A laptop is simply better in just about every way compared to the gimped tablet.

Unless you have a niche case then it tablets lose thar battle. Even the gorm factor is trash if you need to get productive stuff done typically, because a bigger screen makes a big difference when you need to open documents up and get stuff done. Tablets aren't nearly as capable and that's just period.

Edit: grammar


On the contrary, I think it's easier and better to make macOS touch-friendly. This approach only requires Apple to modify the GUI, while iterating on iPadOS requires Apple to build up *everything else*. 

Look at it this way. Text boxes and text selection is a challenge on touch OSes since the distance between two letters is usually much smaller than the width of a finger. The original iPhone had no text selection capability, which is a substantial limitation on functionality. 

Apple could have addressed this issue in one of four ways: 

1. All selectable text must be several times larger than normal, basically the size of headlines in today's iOS, so that individual letters can be easily selectable with the finger. Any smaller text is not touch-friendly, so will not be selectable. (The equivalent of the current iOS/iPadOS, with its larger UI elements compared to macOS.) 
2. Make an addition to the usual text/mouse-driven GUI so that text selection works adequately with touchscreens. (The equivalent of a touch version of macOS.) 
3. The usual method of text selection is old and outdated, so a new paradigm is introduced. Perhaps voice input or something resembling the iPod's Click Wheel. (In this case, Apple has to reimagine text input from the ground up.) 

Apple chose option 2 by introducing a magnifying glass in the iPhone GUI. It's often inconvenient, but has better functionality than option 1 and is practical unlike option 3. I expect a similar approach to hold with macOS on the iPad. If the existing macOS GUI is scaled slightly larger on the iPad and a magnifying glass option for small elements is provided, then I expect this combination to be a good experience on an iPad Pro with a new Magic Keyboard that makes it (according to Gurman) "even more like a laptop than the current setup."


Not really my point. With macOS you now have access to the complete ecosystem and actually use demanding software that pushes the chip. Dev tools for instance. You could even have the regular macOS desktop env launch when you connect the Magic Keyboard. Now you have a device that can replace your laptop and also be used as a tablet. It doesn’t matter how much they expand iPadOS, it will never match the breadth of software a full featured OS offers.


I know. That’s what I said.


I too like to have my emotional breakdowns mid-flight.


Everyone has their preference!


It’s such a shame they killed linuxondex, with more support and modern Linux tools like box64 it would’ve been the perfect low power high performance portable computer


[deleted]


What has that got to do with the margin?


The iPad's best keyboard Apple's own portable "magic keyboard qwerty" imho though it's expensive for a bluetooth keyboard but a lot lighter and cheaper than the official dock thing which is in fact lower quality to type on.


Not a easy problem to solve. There’s two path to this. 

Take the strict separation path. Hunker down on iPad’s touch computing and mac’s desk computing. There are separate big markets for both individually, and both market afford can buy both devices at the same time if they want to.

Take the blended path. Mac and iPad suddenly have to compete with the entire computing market and each other. Usability will increase but I think it will edge towards desk computing.


Ah yeah that makes sense actually!

Yeah start bleeding into the mid/low end hardware first, I could actually see that working out within a few generations


In hindsight, you dismissing creative professionals as ‘drawing pictures’ says everything about your attitude about the subject. Not going to argue with someone who has no understanding of an industry that, no, is not a super niche subset.

Enjoy the rest of your day.


It’s actually not a small segment. It is the larger segment. Enterprises use iPads for a LOT of scenarios.


>Just a plug here... but why in the world won't apple realease a surface studio like microsoft?  It would be amazing.

Besides Apple's general opposition to combining macOS with touchscreens…. 

I think Apple has all-in-one desktops on the back burner, given the lack of iMac updates for over two years and the "missing" iMac Pro, while the Mac mini and Mac Studio at least got M2 series updates.


Dunno what art field you work in, but speaking as a former game artist of 6 years and a freelance artist for about a decade, at least half (if not more) of the freelance illustrators I know (myself included) use iPads as their primary work device, especially considering recent issues with Adobe and the stellar performance of Procreate.

Wacoms are probably still more popular among studio artists and in certain fields (I’d assume game art and animation) but the iPad and Apple Pencil with Procreate are imo the best portable digital art tools (and the best digital illustration tools in general) currently on the market and that portability is a big plus for freelancers (I love being able to work in bed/on the couch/literally anywhere).

Also never having OS updates cause my Apple Pencil to stop working the way Windows kept doing with my Wacom is a big plus.

None of the artists I personally know use the Surface. I bought the Surface Pro 1 as my first tablet/laptop hybrid and had so many problems with it. Had to get it replaced/sent for maintenance twice in 3 years. Maybe the newer models are better but my prior experiences made me wary.

So, yeah, maybe different preferences in different fields \*shrug\* in any case I definitely disagree it’s too small for professional work. It took some getting used to coming from a 24” cintiq but I eventually adjusted and the screen size  doesn’t bother me at all anymore. And honestly helps curb my perfectionist tendencies. Sometimes being able to see every pixel at perfect detail when zoomed way in isn’t a good thing!


So again, none of that is required for what I mentioned above except for maybe the keyboard.

You are hyper focused on work or people that use their laptops for intense activities.

I’m talking about the average consumer or average workplace that uses tablets.

I have a laptop. I use it maybe 3x a year. Between my phone and iPad I can do anything I want, including an online tutoring gig I picked up during the pandemic. But I much prefer the tablet, it’s am,I h better form factor and much better for media, which is what I use it 80% of the time for. And I use it an average of 5 hours a day.


Your use case will always need a computer. No serious code will be written on tablet.


Good to know, I don’t do any artistic things so it makes sense from that perspective. I’m an engineer and thus have zero artistic abilities.


Margin on a case for the iPad to give it a keyboard is higher than the Mac or iPad


I think iPad form factor will win out with lighter/thinner touch and using a bluetooth keyboard/mouse if using as Macbook. This is all before foldable screen tech matures. Battery tech is also improving along with the excellent Apple Silicon chips too. Most likely Apple will roll out a HybridOS across devices with more power options available to unload if needed. Some sort of CoreOS or NixOS like future for software?


Especially as creative pros were the only people keeping apple afloat at one point


you keep missing his point... but thats okay I guess


No one cares what you say. Everything I said is accurate. You are hyper focused on nonsense. The average person or work benefit more from a laptop as it outlasts the tablets and has way more capability than the tablet. The average consumer included. No one care what you individually do. Most people use a laptop or computer when they need to get stuff done not ipad. You're rambling about you, you, you and no one cares. 

Most folks want something that will last them for the price and have a more full fledged OS. iPads don't have that. Tons of folks om this sub already are telling you the exact same thing. They want the tablet to actually be able to do what laptops can already do via MacOS. Just about every major thing a tablet can do a laptop can, but not the other way around. 

Outside of a niche like touch that most folks aren't going to lose sleep over laptops simply can do just about everything the tablet can. The tablet however cannot do anywhere near what the laptop can. It's mostly just a gimped device cat vids and maybe an email check. Has no business imo being in the same price range when it's sooooo much less capable. I'd only consider older gen ones on sale for folks once you factor in the higher price ipads they just don't bring the same value overall to most.


This is a bit short-sighted. 

If they open up the software it’s absolutely doable. That’s the only thing holding it back.


Margin is the percentage of the purchase that is profit. Do you know whether it costs Apple less to make an iPad than it does to make a MacBook, or vice versa? I don’t.


Apple is a 3 trillion dollar company now, who cares about the creative pros.

^((/s))


I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not. You are just so obsessed with with minutia you arnt considering how these devices are typically used or the type of people who use them.

Like your last paragraph is hilarious. You totally miss the major benefit of a tablet, which is the touch and single screen. That’s not a niche thing, that’s literally a major differentiator of a tablet from a laptop…

You just hate the idea of a tablet. And that’s fine. But don’t pretend like things like mobility and touch screen are “niche” rofl.


The thing holding it back is that the iPad is a good tablet but a shit laptop. Putting macOS on it doesn’t solve that. There’s no need for it and if Apple ever did go insane and do something like this, it would be a disaster.


Common sense says the iPad would have a larger profit margin. But the margin for the keyboard for it would be absurdly high


There is no shot the chintzy Magic Keyboard thing doesn't have better margins than the machined aluminum plus keyboard plus force touch trackpad on the bottom case of a Macbook. 

Plus Apple gets a cut of every monetary transaction you make in regards to software on the iPad.


I can't tell if you can't read or not? Multiple people telling you tablets aren't q better value than the laptops for what most folks do and you haven't given anything at all that counters it. At all.

Like your second paragraph, you miss what most folks do on computer is often better with keyboard and mouse considering many folks have to shove out $300 for a crappies keyboard. If it was all about touch they wouldn't, but we all know touch has severe limitations. You totally miss how most folks get more value out the laptop and how literally 9/10's of this sub is talking about how gimped the tablets are due to not having a proper OS and only having touch sucking for even some basic tasks. 

You hate the idea of a laptop. Meanwhile, I am just pointing out the flaws in the tablet considering they are practically the same price or the iPad even can end up being more for waaaaaaaay less capability that folks use and waaay less longevity. You can hate the idea of having laptop, but let's not pretend that most folks don't get way more value out the laptops or that the IS of an iPad is anywhere near the same as MacOS. Severely gimped bud.


The issue isn’t the hardware.


I own a 2018 iPad Pro. I love it but I have not been tempted to upgrade even one time since then.


Until they revamp the OS, the actual device is meaningless


Can’t wait to get one so I can watch Netflix on a slightly better screen


Doubt they’ll do anything significant while iPadOS is still in its current state tbh

New screen tech is nice but not a game changer when the screens are already such high quality


Make it actually do something with the processor then call me. Right now it does not use the M2 speed It’s been given


An 11" Pro with OLED would be my ideal iPad.

I'd pick one up day 1.


Story is thin on the ground. Possible OLED in 2024. Possible bigger iPad. Ok.


I would love to use my iPad Pro as a laptop, but it’s basically a gimped mix between a phone and computer. Let me manage windows better for the love of god.


We need a bigger step towards the PRO side of things. You kinda walked the right way with stage manager and external display support…but we need more.

I don’t mind if you lock new iPadOS features into this new iPad Pro…just push the “desktop mode” further


Here’s my wishlist (currently have an 11” M1 Pro)-

-	Landscape oriented front facing camera
-	16GB of RAM standard on all Pro models
-	Laser etched matte screen option
-	Second Thunderbolt port
-	Best screen on 11” too (either micro-LED or OLED)
-	Data through the Smart Connector so when you use the Magic Keyboard, the Lightning port actually works for more than just changing.
-	Lighter/thinner Magic Keyboard (iPad + keyboard is really thick and heavy).
-	Better storage for the Pencil with the Magic Keyboard
-	Continued improvement and iterations to iPadOS


There has to be a bridge link between iPad + MacBook Pro. Otherwise it’s just another boring iPad that will sit in the corner of your homez


Gonna keep my M1 devices, they‘re perfectly fine and more than just capable


Wouldn’t a glass back add a ton of weight to the iPad?


I would not mind a 16” iPad Pro…and the 16” magic keyboard that would have to come out with it


If by revamp they mean it’ll have full on Mac OS, then I’m in.

If not… pass.


I used the original iPad Pro heavily for 5 years until i dropped it and cracked the screen.  What an awesome product.   I rarely used my laptop at home after i got one.


iPad Pro mini PLEASE I will do anything for this to happen


[deleted]


What about major iPadOS revamps? Can I have access to a Linux container so I can get actual work done on the device? Or is that idea too scary for poor ol apple

More pro apps isn't gonna make these expensive ass tablets any more useful, the base OS needs to be pro friendly


I will never buy an iPad unless they start supporting multiple user accounts.


I bought the second gen 2017 iPad Pro with the 120hz screen. Apple has STILL not given me a reason to upgrade. iPadOS is so limited! Every single time I try to make it replace a laptop, I’m met with more and more limitations, annoyances, and desires to just want a damn computer in front of me. All I use it for now is watching YouTube in the bath or kitchen and I’ve gone back to my dinky Dell laptop for some coffee shop light productivity. It’s just a big phone with the same damn mobile apps. 

I even use a 2019 iPad Pro for work! I work at an architecture firm and have probably 500+ hours of using it on the field. Mobile apps just SUCK! They hardly work and are usually cut down POS compared to the desktop. 

iPad has a software crisis. The hardware has been fast enough for iPadOS for 5 fkin years.


Are we in the rounded edge or sharp edge phase of innovation?


The iPad lineup definitely needs a major revamp. I hope it also comes with a reworking of iPadOS.


The ipad pro is pretty close to perfect. Just fix the damn OS


That shit better come with MacOS


One feature I really miss on the iPad is haptic feedback. It’s so useful on the iPhone and would improve the iPad even more than OLED in my opinion.


What am I possibly going to do with more power? I type notes. I watch YouTube. I read. Give me the possibility to actually do something with more power, and I’ll consider upgrading.


I don’t give two shits about OLED

I’d much rather an LCD that can go brighter than the current options. 

Perfect contrast levels don’t matter to me when I *can’t see the display in outdoor sunlight*

The big change I want to see is either a second thunderbolt port or put the MacBook magsafe charger on it


Nice! This may get me to switch from my 2019 11”.


As an early adopter & iPad Pro owner since the very beginning I welcome drastic upgrades. 
Larger size even as much as a 16”
Lighter weight
OLED screens
Longer battery 
M2 or M4 chipsets
Are all excellent options


Apple Pencil 3?


Calculator app incoming!


Just give it MacOS, add touchscreen functionality. That’s it. The iPad has the M1 chip literally the same chip as the laptops.


hear me out … iMacPadBookPro


I’ve been waiting for an OLED iPad Pro for so long


Been using the 11” iPad Pro (2020) since iOS 13.7 and the single most important issue I’ve found is SOFTWARE. iPadOS brings numerous ideas that work well with GUI designed with touch in mind, however, not necessarily with Pro workflows. I often find mine iPad struggling to run even basic software combinations like Safari + Pages, where tabs keep refreshing and I need to look for all the information again. It’s not a behaviour I’d expect from even the most basic PC, and definitely not from expensive “Pro” device. And iPad is even less capable for actually Pro-workflows due to OS and lack of software like HandBrake, MKVToolNix, Audacity, OBS Studio, etc.

So, even if the new iPad Pro brings jaw-dropping changes I’m not upgrading. I’d rather sell my iPad altogether as I’ve been waiting way too long for the OS it truly deserves to come. For my needs chromeOS devices  are more capable, not to mention Windows.


Just give the damn thing Mac OS and call it Mac OS portable


Mate it doesn’t matter. At all. They literally could offer an iPad with the following features: 
64gb ram 
2 terabyte SSD
oled
M2 Ultra Chip 
48MP Sensor 
4 thunderbolt 4 ports (fuck it, let’s make it 8). 
Sd card slot 
Four hdmi ports. 

And I still wouldn’t give a single fuck about it. What does that thing do that my 2018 iPad doesnt. For real, I’m someone who’s willing to spend money on hardware,  but since ive bought my iPad 4 years ago, I haven’t had a single thought about replacing it. Software holds it back too much.


Doesn't matter because it's still going to be useless. iPad has little to no productive use in general for individuals beyond being an overpriced notebook (with horrible writing experience) , or an overpriced textbook (does better in some ways). Both of these aspects are much better served with an eink device.


If they put a competent version of Final Cut on it, maybe


iPad Pro mini… one can dream


okay, so the same rumors we've been hearing for the past year.


iPad Pro M3 3nm!

I have a 2018 iPad Pro 11" 7nm with a crack screen and I'd only upgrade after the last iPadOS Security Update is released.

So maybe by year 2027? By then a sub-1nm iPhone chip would be used with a power draw of less than 0.1W.


macOS lite for iPads


I’m holding on to my struggling 2017 because I believed after the M2, it’s due for a redesign. Hopefully it’s gonna be great


The main problem is that there really isn't a need to have 4 iPad models being sold concurrently. I'd say keep the Pro, the Mini, and the Air, axe the 10th gen iPad, rename the Air as just simply "iPad" (drop the Air) and go from there. And that's at a minimum. I'd argue even the Air isn't really all that relevant and maybe could be disposed of too. Have the cheap, tiny one for kids or people who want something portable and the big expensive powerful one for people who need the power. 

But even then I don't know what you could do from a hardware perspective for these devices. Maybe just mount the selfie cam on the landscape edge and give them all USB C (can't remember if the mini has it or not). Besides that any improvements really just need to be in software. Like if they sold an iPad Pro that could be configured to run MacOS out of the box, that alone would be huge.


iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation) here, I would only upgrade to a bigger screen in the same os this one, would be something in the 14” - 15” range


All well and good, but how much are they gonna bump the price up by? My preference is the Pro simply due to the max storage size. If they did the Air with 1TB or 2TB, I’d likely go for an Air. But until that point, I have to go for the Pro.


Given how boring Apple has become post-Jobs I expect this “major revamp” means new colors or something.


The Apple PR season is upon us. Get ready to see the big buzzwords: incredible, all-new, pro-level, unlocking, major leap, game changing, best-in-class, etc.


The iPad lineup confuses me so much, I just don’t understand their intended use cases. 

To me, they all seem to do more or less the same thing, all of them have powerful modern chips and all run the same apps. 

I have a 9th generation basic iPad, I can happily edit 4K video on it in Lumafusion, design labels and marketing material in Procreate, edit RAW images in LS and PS, sure I get reloads in Safari tabs and perhaps rendering etc could be quicker (and I accept it could be a different story with better cameras etc and bitrates) but if I can do all this on the basic iPad… And I also do this for work, I run a few businesses and all my design work, packaging, product design etc can be done on the basic iPad. The iPad aimed at kids.

How are so many different models justified? Just screens, accessory compatibility and designs? Too much choice, they need to use the OS and differentiate between their pro line and consumer line. Or maybe not if they sell a bucketload of pros anyway. The one thing I wish for though is the external display support of the M line models.


U mean major price increase?


If it gets wireless charging I’ll buy it


It doesn't matter at all the hardware until they make iPad OS not sick


Gee,  I'd love a 1/8" headphone jack


I’ll take a major update iPad mini.


Next year is when I’ll be looking to upgrade from my 10.5” Pro


Oled screen is a boring upgrade, headphone jack would be more exciting


Oled isn’t enough for a major iPad revamp. They better add new ports or improve the battery life or give the Pros some major software perks. If they just added Oled it would be the mini LED 12’9 iPad Pro all over again.


The only meaningful 'revamp' I think they could do is incorporate the keyboard permanently in some kind of retractable/foldable fashion, and update iPadOS to where it's basically macOS. So basically merge what used to be the Macbook form factor with iPad.


Foldable ipad pro pls


They can do fuck all they want but as long as ipados is still dog water ipad is getting no where lol


iPads are a funny product, aren't they. They seem great for visual artists, especially designers, but who else is this not-quite-an-iphone-but-also-not-quite-a-mac device for? What problem does it solve that the iPhone and a Mac doesn't?

It's such an in-between product, that doesn't really fit. We all want it to exist, me including, but... what for? I had one, and it collected dust. I had to give it away, because it wasn't portable like my iPhone, and ipadOS is inferior to macOS, so when I really had to work I switched to my macbook instead. And really, an iPad Pro costs alsmost as much as a Macbook these days.

iPads just simply do too little, and cost too much.

I wonder if Apple feels the same.


And I just bought a 12.9" M2 at the end of last year.  It should hopefully last me at least as long as my second generation 12.9" Pro lasted.  And that one was still going strong, except that the battery life was reduced to about two hours.


12.9 Inch m1 owner here

am i going to fade into obscurity or live just a little while longer


I have a hard time imagining an iPad that will make me want to upgrade this m1 12.9


Gurman throwing shit against the wall again.


I have an iPad 2020. Still works fantastic. I’ll probably upgrade in another 4 years


The problem is that apart from a few drawing/design/photography manipulation apps, the rest of the applications do not need an Mx SoC. 

I have an iPad Pro that my company gave me and I use it everyday. It is fantastic. But for my usage the iPad Air would be equally fantastic; even the base iPad!


Spoiler alert, it's more like a Surface than ever.


Still happy with my 2020 12.9 ipp. I don’t think I’ll be upgrading this time.


Still using the iPad pro from 2018 and I see no reason to upgrade. It serves its purpose and Apple has not done any update that makes better QoL improvements. The battery does not stand up anymore compared to the new Macs.


Hopefully it runs tvOS


Want people want from an ipad pro:

MacOS + iOS (some sorta hybrid) with touch support. maybe usb 3.2 (or faster) data transfer

What people get: a big iphone that cannot be used as a real phone

apart from using it as a digital drawing tablet, for artists, i dont really see what the point of a "pro" ipad is.

But of course i dont have an ipad pro.

i had the old ipad (3rd gen) and i never ever used it... i much preferd using a laptop


iPad issue is not hardware, it’s the software. Apple separated iPadOS from IOS but in terms features the two OS are pretty much the same….


So they’re gonna add dual-booting macOS.
Right?
Right?


They should get rid of the terrible mini led display and place the camera into landscape.


In terms of hardware (as usual) or software (as never)?

Update:

> This revamp should offer an “updated design” as well as an upgrade to OLED displays for the first time. 

\*sigh\* OK, as I expected. The news is as usual about catching up with iPhone hardware. Obviously OLED on iPad would be prettier. But...


I own iPad air if the iPad pro is any good I might buy it.


Also prepping a major price hike.


Will this major update include a calculator app by default.....?


What more can than do other than putting actual desktop OS on it?


Better SOC

BETTER DISPLAY

Amazing Keyboard

THE BEST IPAD EVER

iPAD OS THE BEST OS FOR THE IPAD

Only 1999€ (Keyboard not included)


I haven't bought an ipad since 2013 ipad retina. Since then ipads have tried to be mobile and computers but fails to excel at either. It's blindly serves as a big display now that fulfils neither niches


Really hope so. Still holding on to my 2018 11”, tho it still works good. 

After having a month’s experience of working from the ipad (while my MacBook Pro was getting a screen replacement), I found it not too bad to use the ipad for work.

Wanted to get the current 12.9 to use when I travel.
Not comfortable flying with my Macbook for the fear of getting jammed in between other people’s luggage, and my stuff that might sit on top inside my backpack.
An iPad with a good case would put my mind at ease.
Therefore, contemplated whether to get the current, but glad I stopped myself and saved.

If the next iPad is going to be as expensive, it’d better be worth the changes rather than just slight changes.


I really don't care about any new iPad unless it has a 15-16" screen. That alone would be a reason to upgrade my good old iPad Pro 12.9" 2nd gen (2017).


A foldable iPad was rumored a while back. 14" or 16" that folded in half would be cool.


M1 until software is massively updated


yea lemme sleep


Flat glass that slightly curves at the edge.


Put MacOS on iPad you cowards.


Revamp the OS. Let the people actually use it for proper desktop replacement. 

Let people code, create, work as close as possible to the pc experience. Than this device will be a game changer


#pro apps on pro ipads


Laughs in my 2-in-1 full PC (okay the battery sucks but it’s quite nice to have a touch screen laptop )


With all these rumors about a touch screen MacBook, might we finally get an iPadOS that’s similar to MacOS and less like iOS? Probably not, but there’s always hope.


Calculator


Ooooooh.  A glass back?  Take my money. /s


Can I use an audio input in two apps simultaneously yet? No? Maybe they'll innovate that thing computers could do 20 years ago in another 10 years. "Like a laptop" smh


My 2017 iPad Pro is quickly becoming a brick due to unresponsive touch screen and bad battery. I’d love to move that down to a dedicated sidecar display


I’d love to get an iPad Pro 13” but it’s just heavy for use. I wish it got a bit lighter


How about iPad Pro max?


People have been saying problem's iPadOS for years. 

After the HomePod release where they barely improved Siri, I wonder why apple seems to be so oblivious.


A 14” or 16” iPad? I’ll bet big money against that prediction.


Gurman is announcing products faster than Apple can make think of them


Just revamp the damn software and get rid of the shitty iOS restrictions. 

There is no reason a $200 Samsung phone with far far inferior hardware should ever be more functional than an iPad Pro with a literal desktop class cpu.


iPad with macOS


My dream is apple having 150 pads to chose from, each with a minor difference between each of them.. that is what consumers want.


Just keep trying to execute tried and true windows management paradigms within the context of a touch screen and I’ll be happy.

I was NOT impressed by stage manager.


I just wish they'd release a big one (\~16"), even if it's a one-time limited edition one.  I know I'm not a common use-case scenario, but I use my iPad Pro as a portfolio for when I meet with clients (photography and retouching).  Once the novelty wore off I noticed a lot of people went back to prints as an 11x14 print is better to display your work, even if the iPad is cheaper (vs constantly buying ink and paper for a $1200 printer) and easier to use/update.

I don't see a need to update if it's just going to be a slightly faster processor (I have a proper workstation for editing, and a MBP for work on the go).  The day they finally give us a 16" screen I preorder though.


So people are saying it’s lacking SOMETHING. What is it lacking specifically for people who uses ipad everyday? I don’t own one and would love to hear what kind of changes you guys would like?


I bought my last iPad in 2019, but unless there is a significant change my next “iPad” will probably be a MacBook Air. I am having an increasing amount of difficulty with touchscreens working when I am typing and the cost between an iPad and a Mac Air isn’t that great. 

My problems with touchscreens isn’t limited to Apple Products, I am having problems with just about any touch activated device for whatever reason. My phone, my tv control, my car smart screen….


Why revamp it? What we have right now is the equivalent of a sports car that is speed limited to 30mph. Maybe let the software actually do something with the processor that can run a desktop class operating system...


New year > "new apple product" > same functions > new price

and the cicle start's again


For only 3000 dollars


If the OS was as revolutionary as the product once was, maybe I would buy one again. But it’s really handcuffed OS experience at the moment.


How many „big revamps“ does that make now? And it still has no real use other than reading and surfing.


If i wanted an ipad on a budget whats my best bet?  Maybe £300 - £400 tops. 

Looks like i could get a new 10th gen for just over £400, but i wouldnt mind an older version of pro/air if it performed similarly


IT FOLDS NOW


I have a 2021 pro, and I kind of regret getting this device.  It is basically a large-format iPhone, and a glorified Homepod station for my smart devices.  If I knew they never planned to expand on the use cases for the pro, I would have just gotten the cheapest iPad for media consumption.

iPhone covers portability, and Macbook or PC covers tasks that are challenging to complete on mobile.


I have the first gen iPad Pro and aside of battery life, I have no reason to upgrade.  They really need to focus on UX of iPad


By doing what...thinner bezels? lol


I wish we had surprises


MagSafe + OLED doesn’t exactly strike me as a ‘major revamp’


It doesn’t need to be more powerful. It’s as powerful as my daily driver laptop. It needs macOS. So it can replace my laptop.


I can't wait, giving my 2017 iPad Pro to a friend in need and buying the M2 iPad Pro 11" next week.  When the next one comes out, IF it's got features worthy of having I'll buy it and give the M2 to the gf.    
I'm always using the camera and on my iPads.  I like the bigger view finder.    
It will be fun to see where apples goes with the development of the iPad and iPadOS.


OLED 11 inch is the one I will go with for sure


[deleted]


Its the software. Apple has ether to change the OS or to make it much much more easier(and free) to build apps for the OS.


My theory is that the touchscreen mac and the 16” iPad Pro are the same product. Docked is macOS undocked is iPadOS or can toggle between at anytime.


Without having windows like on Windows/Mac , multitasking on an iPad will always be cumbersome.


I actually just bought this one from apple certified refurbished store. It’s amazing how well this thing runs even today. Takes care of everything I need it to do and runs so well.


I have the same iPad, and the only thing I’d be interested in is going to a 13”. Other than that it’s still kicking butt.


I just realised that my iPad Pro will be eight years old this year. **Why is time moving so quickly?!**


These companies need to be like video games. Come out with a great product that last 4-6 years then reintroduce the new generation instead of yearly products instead of oversaturating the market


The only thing that I needed replaced was the USB-C port but besides that, it's been fantastic!


The only reason I’d upgrade from my 2018 pro is if they add a microled/oled screen. Or miniLED. I ain’t fussy.


Same. I've also come to accept that I'll never replace my MacBook with an iPad so the next iPad I get would probably be a mini. Preferably, iPad mini with an OLED ProMotion display, please!


I did finally go from my 2018 11” Pro to an M2 Pro 12.9” but most of it was for going back to a larger drawing surface and better screen. I still use my 11” on the regular, but it does need a new battery — the battery life’s awful.

At this rate, I’ll upgrade again in 2026+ or so. Software needs to catch up first.


I’ve got the M1 Pro and this thing is so overpowered, I can’t imagine I’m gonna have to upgrade anytime soon.


I picked up a mini last week and I'm kicking myself for not trading my 3rd gen 12.9" pro in towards it. I have no desire to use the pro anymore. 

The mini is just so vastly superior in form factor and ergonomics for my usage (drawing and web browsing from the couch/bed). 

I was hesitant to get one now knowing they're due for a refresh in the next year, but after using it extensively for the last week I'm sore that I didn't give in to the technolust and buy one sooner.


Me either - I've been holding out for a screen upgrade (I have the 11" version). My battery life is getting short these days though, but I hope it will hold one for another 1 - 1.5 years for the upgrade.


2017 Pro here. Same.


I have the 2020 iPad Pro (4th gen).  I’d upgrade for either an OLED or a larger screen.


Still rocking a 2017 512GB iPad Pro (Wi-Fi only). It’s my go-to device at home, and even used it for work a couple of years. Would only consider upgrading if a considerable upgrade is made and the price does not skyrocket any more than it already has. Had an extensive Comixology library, and would have eventually gone for a higher SSD option, but after Amazon basically killed that service I have no urgent need for more memory.


Same. The keyboard folio has mostly stopped working though which is becoming a really annoying problem


Same here. For a while now, I have decided that I will upgrade once the iPad Pro goes OLED (as it is my last screen that is not OLED and it shows) and 2024 may be that year. 

Still, my by now 4 year old iPad Pro is still going strong despite strong everyday usage.


same. They have a high bar to give any urgency to upgrading. The latest pros are fantastic.


Same here. But the let down is the battery capacity is way less now. Still worth it to replace the battery and keep the 2018 iPad


I have the 2020 model and zero desire to upgrade. Everything is great, CPU, display, battery, speakers, weight, pure bliss for what I do with it 😻


I just bought a 2018 refurbished 11” iPad Pro. It’s awesome. I wanted the No-home-button design and 120hz screen and I paid less than a new entry level iPad. I’m super happy with it.


Same


Same here. The software is so limited that I have no use for a better machine right now. The screen is great, speakers are great, battery is fine.


It’s a media consumption device. I like watching and browsing on it. That’s how I like to use it. When I want to be more productive I’ll use my laptop. My surface laptop has a touchscreen, which I forget about because I’m not normally touching the screen if I want to be productive, this may be different for people who are into creative fields though.


I’ve been tempted but in the end I just don’t use it enough to justify it.


Same. I think the battery may be getting a lil stale, but that is serviceable.


All I am thinking about with mine is when to get the battery replaced. I’ve never purchased a tech product with less need to upgrade it after 4+ years.


Similar. One thing that has been rumored is the idea that new models could function as reference grading monitors. That would make me very interested.


Same. It’s so good that I keep trying to justify upgrading, but I just can’t. It does everything I need it to and is still blazing fast.


Wanna use mine for another 5 years. Still feels brand new


I had a 2018 but the battery just couldn’t hold a charge overnight so I swapped up. Otherwise the thing worked perfect.


Same. My 2018 iPad Pro does everything I want, but to be honest I don’t really need the pro features. So I’ll hang on to this one as long as possible then get whatever the latest Air offering is.


I haven't upgraded since I bought my 2016 ipad pro.


I have the OG apple air. I watch TV in bed and listen to audible to sleep. Never needed to upgrade battery is still fine


Same. It’s still an iPad. Until it can run standalone apps function more or less as a laptop, I have zero reason to ever upgrade.


Same here
still a beast


Have you noticed faster battery train while idle? Love mine, but been noticing this.


i had 2015 ipad pro 12.9, ran even procreate and CSP like a champ !

Could not believe my eyes when i installed csp and was using wet brush


I have a job meeting with individual people. As I’m meeting with them, I’ll use an iPad for some notes or to reference some materials. Occasionally I’ll want to print the materials on the fly. It’s so frustrating trying to print on the iPad sometimes. I open documents in Google drive, OneDrive, and safari, and it’s like they all have their own steps to print, and they don’t all consistently work. Need to print multiple things at once? Good luck. It’s the same hardware as the iMac sitting on my desk. It’s very frustrating that it is so limited.


I mean this is really it, isn’t it? I hope this doesn’t sound ignorant, but in general, every iPad feels exactly the same. Except for maybe the M1, considering what they actually do.


Yes. If they want people to buy a pro device, it needs to have some pro software too. Please just give us something like Mac OS when docked , and iPadOS when not.


Yup, Ipad is, by far, the device that has the most unused potential.


Yes, can I tile two apps vertically ffs? Can we tile more than two apps at a time? It’s low hanging fruit. What’s wrong with them?


People have been telling apple this for nearly a decade.


This


you may have gone too far ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `


Didn't they just try with Stage Manager? Apple lost most of their institutional software design knowledge in the great iOS 7 reshuffle. I don't think they have it in them anymore.


Right?!  I feel like the majority of us all use the phones, iPads and Computers 99% the same as the last 5 years!  Nobody wants new crap added, we’re good.  The phone camera just needs to keep getting better, because that’s all we buy a new phone for.   We don’t need any new features on any of these devices anymore. The good features are all there, added over the last decade.


Hopefully this means we might get a much more sophisticated OS to go with these new tablets


I was on a flight a few weeks ago with my M1 11" pro and I was next to a lady with the 12.9" with the micro led screen. We were both watching a movie and I couldn't stop glancing back and forth between our screens and noticing how black the backs were and how bright the light colors were. It was clearly a way better screen. 

I used to have a 12.9", but it was just too big for me, but damn, that micro led screen is amazing.


[deleted]


They can't figure out how to fix scrolling with an external mouse scroll wheel. Good Luck.


its funny. i'm an ipad guy more than a macbook guy. I could potentially be buying an ipad pro with more power than my M1 macbookpro in the next year.


Does most people even have any workflow on the ipad, that requires that much juice?

i mean, i guess if you for some reason wanna edit video on it... (but why would you?)


Every year when it gets further ahead of what it needs, I think "this is the time when Apple will unveil the major iPadOS update and AR!" It's been like five years now... Remember how Apple even changed the name to iPadOS? Such a tease.


Just let me run programs on my CPU. Pretty much every computer on earth lets you do this, except for iPads. Only Apple-approved programs allowed.


Im with you on this, but im wondering what speed improvements you could imagine in speed? 
I mean, my only wish would be that it runs macOS. (Now since monterey, even the control center looks like touch buttons) but that is not as hard to do now I think. Even the first devkit for apple silicon was built with an iPad pro hardware (A12Z) and that ran the os wonderfully. 
For day-to-day tasks iPad Pro is a huge overkill, it can only shine if you use specific apps that do task for minutes long at least. And yet I own 2 and only use it for casual reddit + safari.


What would you do with it after picking up?


iPad Mini Pro with OLED.

I couldn’t stop noticing how the max phone and the mini are ‘so close’, so I tried to go with a full size iPad for a while - it’s not working.

Please, pretty please Apple - offer us a Pro Mini and we will prove that the Pro makes you more money than the Base, just like the iPhone 14.


What is the point of putting OLEDs in phones and tablets?


I’m afraid of what the price would be for such a device.


Yeah, really. Let us run desktop apps. Become a real competitor to Surface Pro. I don't care about a glass back.


"mAjOr rEvAmP"


What is it you want to do but can’t?


Stage Manager and external display support are great ideas in theory, but the execution was awful.

I tried the external display support on my M1 12.9” iPad Pro and the input lag was awful.


They can throw billions to make these ideas happen, make the best hardware in the world, give it quantum supercomputer power and it will still be hardly better than a 2018 pro. Without mac apps, or straight up Mac OS it'll never become a computer.


If we get 16 GB of RAM and the ability to run MacOS apps when hooked up to an external display.  Or at least VMs.

Apple barely has to do anything to allow this. They already added a hypervisor API. All they have to do is not ban apps that use JIT on the App Store and Parallels could make an iPad app.


> Lighter/thinner Magic Keyboard (iPad + keyboard is really thick and heavy).

It is a bit of a chunker when carried with the magic keyboard. They're in a bit of a bind here. They can try to do the recent folio style keyboard which I think would be considerably lighter but that surface style keyboard makes for a longer footprint. The current magic keyboard, afaik, part of the problem is with the ipads being so heavy, they need to have some weight to counterbalance. But it is probably more usable on something like an airplane seat. I think I'd rather have a lighter surface/folio style keyboard, however.


Yes, I hope a matte display option is coming to the iPad soon

Also really keen on a second thunderbolt port. 

My dream iPad though, would be a build to order option for an SD card slot


Matte screen ??????? You monster.


If it's sitting in the corner than you obviously have no need for it. Doesnt mean the iPad itself is useless


[deleted]


Would be pretty disappointing if they weren’t


But it’s the weight that feels L U X U R I O U S


“The 16-inch iPad Pro starts at just $2,999. And the 16-inch Magic Keyboard is only $699. We think you’re going to love it.”

-Tim Cook, probably


Samsung did something similar with the tablet line and launched the S8 Ultra last year, which is a 14" tablet.

That in itself is already a beast and quite unwieldy to use. Basically it's a tabletop device and at that point, it's not clear why one wouldn't just stick with a laptop.


Or even just a mini with 120hz refresh rate


iPad Mini and MBA with promotion displays are my ideal machines. I don’t think it’ll happen.


So glad I’m not alone in this.


I would trade my ipad mini 6 and buy mini pro


Pretty please Tim Apple 🙏


I’ve been on this bandwagon for years as well. The iPad Mini 6 was such a bust. I preordered within 5 minutes of go live, even chased the UPS guy to get it as early as possible. 

The screen is utter trash. It’s not just the refresh rate - the colors/saturation is bad, the screen looks like it’s lower resolution than the iPad Mini 5, and the worst thing is the jelly scroll. My god is the jelly scroll the worst I’ve ever seen on a device, and I’m fairly sensitive to jelly scroll. Saw it within the first hour of using the device and I was crushed. 

An iPad Pro 9” would be perfect. 120hz promotion and just higher quality displays would be a major win in my book. 

However, and I know this is controversial, but I really want a foldable iPhone/iPad. Give me a device that’s about the same size as the Galaxy Fold4, maybe a bit bigger, that unfolds to ~8.5”. Durability concerns aside (which Apple would solve before a broad release), this would be the perfect device for me. I love my Galaxy Fold4 and use it often, but it won’t replace my iPhone.


You and 3 other people.

Mini lines just don't sell as well.


A proper gaming iPad mini with an APU/GPU is the dream


This would be amazing!!


Do you want macOS, or do you just want the ability to run macOS programs? There’s a subtle difference. I personally just want to run a handful of macOS programs that either don’t have iPad versions, or the iPad versions are watered down crap.


I’d still like my tablet to behave like a tablet though thanks. 

An iPad that can only be used with a mouse and keyboard isn’t much of an iPad.


No way. Without multitouch gestures it would be a disaster.


If you want macOS why don't you just buy a MacBook?


Preach!


Hell I'll take pro apps anyday. As of right now I can't name a single fully fledged pro app on iPad (aside from clipstudio paint and resolve I think?). Not a single full pro adobe app. Not a single 3d program, not even proconsumer-focused blender.


The 10.5” 2017 iPad Pro is a beast and still one of the best iPad releases to date. I’m hoping Apple supports it as long as they did the iPad Air 2.


Yeah the OS needs to catch up. Can’t even use my current iPad Pro to its ability


Apple Pencil 1 had some obvious flaws that 2 fixed, but I gotta say I’m very pleased with 2. I don’t really know what I’d add if I could.

I guess having button functionality similar to the AirPod Pro stem buttons that don’t feel like buttons until you squeeze it, rather than the tap thing that works not every time on the pencil. The first AirPods with the tap seemed super reliable but I’m not quite as impressed with the Pencil 2’s tapping.

I guess I talked myself into one change but really with that I’m extremely pleased with it. And if we’re going crazy maybe that rumor that was going around a couple weeks back where the user could place the pencil on real life items and it would sample the color. If that were great and didn’t introduce other compromises I guess why not.


I mean obviously let it work with macOS, but that’s a different topic.


Being that the iPad is my primary media consumption device, I could not disagree more. 
OLED screen is a huge upgrade and can’t you already use the USB-C port for wired headphones?


lol no way


It’s great for me as a teacher. Trust me when I say that I don’t want macOS on it.


Btw, i still have mi 10.5,  battery is degrading fast, sometimes a litle slower, but its ok.

I wanna buy a new iPad, and i love some things on 10.5 like the display, 4 speakers and 120hz display... but the prices for the Pro right now, are pornographic.    Value per $, it's better to buy a Mac, at least for the people who want to make iPad a computer, on a Mac everything works properly, no need shortcuts, hacks, limit yourself and how you work...


iPad Ultra


Having looked into any pro model before would probably have told you, it’s not for you.


Not sure if that would be a feature worth having, sizeable bezels are needed to at least hold it in the hand properly.


From what I’ve heard, they are not selling that well anymore.


Wait, so you’re saying that if I have a successful product that my customers are buying, I shouldn’t try to change that?


Why should they? The developer tools and security for the Mac are fantastic, far superior to Google Play and that’s because it’s a paid service


I always thought that [Microsoft Surface Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-studio-2-plus/8vlfqc3597k4) has such Apple vibes and Apple is quiet on this front. Might be nice to see something like that.


I don’t understand why we can’t just run mac apps on the iPad as is, you can run iPad apps on the mac


It will be sooo annoying if the keyboard is not removable.


“A touchscreen Mac… an iPad that can be a full computer… are you getting it yet?”


MacPad Pro!


It’s the best value tablet on the market. 

If you put my 2018 11in iPad Pro next to a 2022 11in iPad Pro (M2), it’d be extremely hard to tell the difference. The M-series chip doesn’t feel significantly faster, and I don’t think the camera upgrade matters at all. ^(Who actually uses the iPad rear camera regularly?) And you can buy it professionally renewed for as little as $399. 

Only the 12.9in model has gotten a significant upgrade in the last four years — the miniLED display. 

If you’ve got $800 to spend, don’t spend it all on the newest 11in iPad Pro. You’re MUCH better off buying the 2018 iPad Pro 11in + Magic Keyboard + Apple Pencil.


I mean it’s running a smartphone OS with an upgraded smartphone chip.

My issue isn’t with performance, it’s the fact it has almost no ‘pro features’ that differentiate it from consumer iPads. Never mind make it a computer replacement.


My neighbor was going to trade his in this Christmas and I offered him what apple was going to give him. It's really nice.


I also bought the 2018 iPad Pro 11 inch, certified refurbished from Apple. A friend was working at the Apple store back then, so he I benefited from his 25% employee discount.

Needless to say, it was a heck of a deal


[deleted]


I have a 13" just because I need the _size_ of it, because I use it for sheet music which would be too small for me to read comfortably on a smaller screen.  I really don't need the "pro" processor.  I wish they'd come out with an Air with a larger screen.  The Pro is heavy and way overpowered for my use....there must be others like me that just want a big screen without all the bells and whistles.


I have the same iPad, and the only thing I'd be interested in is going to a Mini Pro.


I’m sure they will rollout a software update that will stop it from kicking butt. Lol


Same. I haven't used it much the last couple years, but also... it kind of reminds me I don't need a new one. If I really wanted to use it, it exists, it works, it's not horrible to use. So... don't be tempted to buy more of a product you don't actually use all the time. It's also why I haven't sold it.


Rhetorical question but I'll bite: Part is of course due to my age and all the routines, getting life into a rut (this makes me almost phobic of it at times when this realization washes over me -- similar memories over time usually implies the feeling of time speeding in hindsight)  and part two years at least due to the lost covid years. :-( I have a hard time telling them apart.


Our perception of time is relative to our years lived. Summer felt like an eternity as a child; now you can practically hold your breath for a season, it seems.

Like when $50 seemed like a lot of money as a kid.


I love your username lol


Apple already does this. You can use your products for 4-6 years. I'm using a 2018 Macbook Pro professionally and it still works more than fine

It's your choice wether you want to upgrade.


With the way things have been going, the only reason I'd upgrade from my 2018 Pro is if it broke


That’s already a thing, just not for the 11inch


Same. OLED or miniLED on the 11” would entice me to upgrade. Otherwise, this M1 chip flies and the Magic Keyboard is excellent


I think the current iPad pros already have miniLED XDR displays


The current miniLED screen in the 12.9“ is a disaster, so don’t bother. Never seen such a horrible Blooming on any screen. The MBP is miles ahead and not even close to be that bad. 

Wish I went for the 11“ at that time, haha.


Yea… people have been talking about the M series chips and power efficiency, etc. with my M2 Pro 12.9”….not seeing it. The battery life is pretty horrible.


Likewise.


iPad software is light years behind Mac OS. Becomes totally obvious when you try to actually work with it in a professional environment. 

Tim Cook has been good for Apple’s financials but not for product development.


Yes it feels like every step on an iPad requires a whole different app, while on a Mac/Windows, everything is just accessible straight away through a pop up or window.


This is interesting, because I often send documents to my phone so I can print using iOS instead of macOS or Windows. I find it so much easier in the other direction. I guess Apple has designed a print solution that is better for the casual user but worse for the power user. I actually have not experienced any difference in the print workflow across apps on iOS - hit share and then hit print. It’s on macOS where I have that problem funnily enough - for example chrome for some reason feels the need to implement its own print feature rather than just delegate to the system print dialog.


Printing is a driver issue from the manufacturer tbh. It's always been horrible no matter where you print from. That's not an Apple issue


For all intents, they kinda do. I mean they can all do the same things just a caring and not as noticeable as people want to truly admit speeds and performances. To the average consumer, no one cares.


Still not buying one til we get Xcode on iPads


For the majority of users this is probably right.  I just picked up a refurbished iPad Air  with an A14 chip for around $500.  I haven't experienced any slowness, even with some of the heavier photoshop/illustrator work.  If I need a bigger screen or more power, I have my Mac.


The only thing that has remotely made me consider buying a new iPad is the screen. Other than that my 2018 iPad Pro does essentially the same thing as a 2022 iPad Pro. Yes the professor is better, but let’s be real how many of us actually *need* that processing power? I certainly don’t, the most intense thing I do is use some floorplan apps and watch YouTube videos. 

If Apple can revamp iPadOS and give me a compelling reason to buy a new iPad I’ll buy one. Until then it’s the same thing.


The limitations of iPadOS aren’t really associated with the mouse and keyboard UX IMO. Could they improve it? Sure. But the real limitations come from the things the OS won’t let apps or the user do. The way the file system works. The way apps are installed and managed. The lack of access to a terminal. The types of system-level control they can exert. Etc. Those are things that you can’t (and shouldn’t) just expose to apps and the user when docked. If you’re going to do them they have to work that way consistently regardless of peripherals.


Hell, let us decide when we want to use what OS. If I wanna use macos even when not docked, so what?

I will never understand this. Why have Mac OS on a tiny screen? I use my ipad pro daily next my Macbook. I don’t want it to be the same at all. I hate overlap, meshes with my mind. I like to have device x dor task x and device y for task y.


For better or for worse (better IMO but many seem to disagree), Apple really doesn’t care much for tiling window managers. That’s not unique to iOS though macOS has the advantage of supporting 3rd party window resizing so others have been able to implement solutions at least.


[removed]


That


There’s things we don’t know we want, until we have. For instance I’ve actually used the LiDAR sensor a TON, but that’s just me. Also I would take a full week battery


A physical switch to go between ipadOS and macOS


I had an iPad mini and can’t tell the difference between a m2 iPad and it (aside from the camera)


Games. Some iOS games really push the device, especially at 120hz


It’s intentionally broken, apple hates scroll wheels


For me I had a iPad mini but I prefer my MacBook Air m2 as my daily driver. I have no faith in apple making any good improvements to iPads anytime soon.


Use the power and incredible screen to only browse social media.


Turn it off and have a sit on the shelf rarely used for a few years


something i cant do with my iphone, right? right??


Jump on reddit.


I loved using mine for home workouts. 

It was way more portable and useful then my iPhone or TV.


This is the best question to ask anyone who bitches and moans about iPad upgrades, but the answer will always be “nothing different”. The constant pursuit of upgraded devices at this point is such a meaningless, consumerist joke.


read on that nice oled screen


Drop it and break the new pointless glass back.


Crossword puzzles and Youtube, as usual.


watch anime and twitch streams


>	I couldn’t stop noticing how the max phone and the mini are ‘so close’,

They're only close by the number because we measure screens diagonally. They still have completely different aspect ratios and phones are on the taller scale of the spectrum. 

I own a 12 Pro Max and a mini 6, and it's still an entirely different experience between the two devices.

>	Please, pretty please Apple - offer us a Pro Mini and we will prove that the Pro makes you more money than the Base, just like the iPhone 14.

A Pro mini is also unlikely to happen considering the cost-cutting needed for the hypothetical Pro mini to be more affordable than its bigger siblings. It will require a tremendous re-work of the internals in order to fit certain components like the triple camera array and the MagSafe magnets at the back.


A lot of times it’s gonna come down to those 2-3 crucial softwares that you just NEED to work at the highest efficiency or the device is a dealbreaker. OneNote is one for me, it’s my go-to productivity app across work/home/classes (when I was in college). I’d rather switch my device than switch OneNote, and the iPad app for OneNote sucks balls compared to the desktop! It constantly has syncing issues, can’t open my large notebooks, can’t sort notes like the desktop, can’t link pages, interface is dumbed down to hell, etc. I’m not asking for a “better mobile OneNote,” I’m asking to use the desktop OneNote that already exists. You can’t “replace a computer” by being ALMOST as good, you have to be AS GOOD or BETTER. 

For work, I use Bluebeam Revu. Again, iPad App is TERRIBLE! I would rather use a windows tablet despite every nicety the iPad offers because one that one critical piece of software. It’s really really tough to change a critical software in your workflow because of an iPads limitations, especially in a professional setting.


Edit in Final Cut Pro, record in Logic Pro, watch multiple video streams at the same time, more ports.. does iPad even have a Terminal ? I’ve been using an M1 iPad Pro as a drawing tablet mainly, but if I tried to replace my MacBook Pro with it I’d probably go crazy.


A terminal. Writing code


Let me run an ide, docker, ssh into other machines, and some of the desktop games a mac can.


Managing Illustration files. The pen input is fantastic don’t get me wrong. Being able to draw anywhere instead of tied to a bulky Wacom pen display has been a dream. However, the file system and image management apps just aren’t there. For example, on my Mac (rip) I could within minutes save multiple copies of an illustration at different sizes, all set up with a quarter inch white margin for the printer. Sounds simple, but to do that on the iPad is so convoluted if not impossible. Also can’t scan a pencil sketch and work on it digitally without using my wife’s computer. I’ve tried so hard to make the iPad work as my solo device since I can’t justify the cost of both a laptop and a tablet and it just doesn’t work. The pencil and procreate are truly amazing though.


Exactly- the iPad needs Mac apps. Port Final Cut and Xcode to iPad already!


Mac apps would be terrible on the ipad. Mac apps and OS are designed for pointers and ipad apps and OS are designed for touch. Why people want to turn the ipad into a Mac is beyond me. 

The M processors in the iPad Pro models are amazing for art, retouching, and audio performance. Those are areas that continue to benefit from more and more power in the processor. AUM along with all the effects and synths, Pixelmator Photo, Procreate, Davinci Resolve, Affinity Designer, etc. all get better as the processor improves. None of those companies would have made those apps if they didn’t think Apple would keep improving the ipad. And yes, those are all “pro” apps. 

“…it’ll never become a computer.” Is a really lazy, gatekeeping take. The iPad Pro is a very powerful, app based (as opposed to browser based) computer designed around touch input and a tighter security system. Those of us that value those things love our iPads. Yes, there is always room to improve but the iPad does not need to become a Mac or run Mac apps to “be a computer.”


Step 1: Buy device you have no use for out of own free will. Step 2: Complain about it on the internet.

Like a detachable iPad dock / screen from MacBook main board.


yes lol


Please no. My 12.9" pro is already so heavy lol.


And you can trade in your current iPad for up to $49


A mini with 120hz m3 chip oled and oficial game pad would be incredible good, no one could even touch that, best hand held gaming device.


Y’all can keep the 120hz, I need a mini with thunderbolt and 1TB option


I’ve been asking for an iPad mini pro for YEARS. I think normal sized ones are annoying to carry around.


I’m thinking of purchasing the mini 6 but trying to hold off until the announcement for the new iPads. I can be hopeful for a pro mini 🥹


For me it's full fat macos or bust. 

Why? 

Window management and multi tasking. 

IpadOS doesn't just have a "software that can run problem", it also has a multitasking and windows management issue. What they've done this year with the new windows management tools on ipadOS are good, but they're a far cry from as powerful as macos. Workspaces, being able to put windows literally anywhere, etc. There's a lot more you can get done with macos than ipad os, and it goes beyond just the applications that run. 

What I really want is the ability to toggle between the two (macos and IpadOS) because they both do things better than the other depending on the context, but user choice would be critical.

Edit: Everyone saying "why not just get a MacBook" is missing the point. Device consolidation is a good thing. It's one less thing to carry around, it's one less device that goes to the landfill once it's retired. 

"Why not just get a MacBook"? Why wouldn't you want a device that fulfills all of your needs, that you can choose to run in tablet mode vs laptop mode? 

The odd thing to me is this hypothetical device could be done with very few compromises to either half of this hybrid approach, so for me it just seems obvious that a tablet/ laptop hybrid would be the final form of a pro level device. But this device seems to just confuse a lot of people here. Apple innovates all the time, it's time for them to innovate on the iPad as well. 

I'm a professional who uses both an iPad and a MacBook for work. If I could have a single device that pulled double duty as both? God, that'd be just incredible.


It wouldn’t have to *only* be used that way. Have the option for a MacOS mode where you could just keep it in iPad OS mode if you wanted to. Same with how they handled Boot Camp for Intel Macs, no one was forced to use Windows on their Mac if they didn’t need it.


Touch UI on a laptop is shit, no thanks. They are ruining MacOS with that stupidity as is.


[deleted]


Because a MacBook isn’t as portable as an iPad and doesn’t have a touchscreen.


>	Can’t even use my current iPad Pro to its ability

I do, frequently, between LumaFusion and Lightroom. 

And battery life suffers hugely as a result. 

I think apple knows what they are doing when it comes to an OS, if iPadOS pegged the performance of the M series chips with day to day use of normal apps then the iPad Pro would have terrible battery life


Then you are stuck between charging or listening

Apple should add a second usb-c port to the iPad Pro specifically for this reason


And then either have to have a dongle to charge or don't charge. So convenient


They got a bump from the pandemic but they're on the way back down now.


Most people replace their laptops every ~7 years. If iPad Pros are laptop replacements, that’s what Apple should expect.


They last too long.  I was expecting to upgrade every 2 years but my last ipad pro lasted 5 years.

A surface is inherently more useful than an iPad, the problem lies more so in windows not being overly touch friendly.

That said, good on Microsoft for moving away from the tablet-like experience with windows, being able to use the surface as a full laptop with the ability to use touch for signing documents and whatnot is just so convenient.


Pretty gorgeous


Cause then you wouldn't buy both. This attitude combined with raising iphone prices along with increased competition are gonna hurt sales imo.


You’d need the full MacOS to do that. iPadOS wouldn’t have the necessary underpinnings. It’s much more likely that MacOS becomes runnable on at least the high end iPads, imho, but with an iPadOS-like layer on top, and then you can also run iPad apps.


The crazy thing is the keyboard and pencil will now cost you more than that iPad Pro.


>Who actually uses the iPad rear camera regularly?

I do when I need to get photos of drawings to import on procreate 🥺

Although, admittedly, having a top of the line camera isn’t really essential for my purposes lol.


Not gonna lie the main reason I bought this over the iPad Air is for pro motion. Aside from that, I don’t really know what the difference between the air and pro is.


I read that older iPad Pro models still have the feature. Really a stupid omission from Apple's part.


It's still insane to me that they took this out.


I can't believe they just took that keyboard away from us one day. I've been typing less and less on it since then. Now it's just URLs and logins, it's become wholly a consumption device for me.


That and the full number row being exclusive to the 12.9 inch model


Try pinching the keyboard to shrink it and then swipe type with one hand? It’s not quite the same but it’s similar


The best way to type without a physical keyboard  is shrinking the keyboard and swiping with the pencil if you have it, or finger. It works pretty well. As much as it’s annoying and dumb that they took the split keyboard away.


15" for sheet music raising hand.


Only the 13” version does


The products are fantastic, ipadOS is lacking.


Do you print from multiple/different apps? There is zero consistency on iPad. Go from safari to Google drive and it is frustrating to find the print button. It represents a larger issue of iPadOS as a whole in that it is convoluted disjointed and doesn’t know what it is. It has great hardware but it runs an operating system mimicking a phone. They made the iPad simple like iPhone, then they added weirdly implemented features to it that make it feel clunky and unintuitive. There are numerous examples of this underlying problem.


Not talking drivers. Just in the apps. I can’t just command+p with my Magic Keyboard. Well sometimes I can in some apps. In others I can’t. I have to search through the app to remember which menu has the right option to let me scroll around and find print. There no consistency even though on my Mac with the same hardware it’s practically universal steps to print. It absolutely is an apple issue. You could say “that’s an issue with the developers for those apps,” but iPadOS doesn’t offer the same features as macOS, like easy printing. Very disappointing and frustrating especially because like we all know it isn’t a hardware limitation.


Yeah. I think the only real obvious difference between them would be the displays? To the grand majority anyway and some people probably wouldn’t even notice that unless they were placed side-by-side.


I’m right there with you. The only reason I went for the Pro was because my MacBook was so old at the time (traded it in) that an M1 iPad Pro would have been enough until I can get myself another computer. I love the iPad Pro. I really really do. But rest assured, I plan to run this thing straight into the ground before I even consider getting another one ever again.


The lack of an easy to use file system was one of the things that pushed me to android even though that file system isn't amazing by any means. 

I bought my ipad pro to do WordPress work in 2016, not even coding, just writing, and it was an absolute abomination the way it handles image files, etc. Everything was hard to access and took three times as long as my Mac. It's now a glorified reader that cost me a grand.

Oh, and apple end of lifed their own damn keyboard folio so that didn't even work anymore with my ipad after two years.


Then you should get a macbook. I think the reason why they’re not doing this is that the MacBooks and the iPads would be too similar for the individual features to stand out. An iPad with the magic keyboard is basically a Laptop with iPad OS.


I mean, good for you, but not all of us want (or can afford) more than one device. Other manufacturers have managed to make 2-in-1 devices work with Windows or ChromeOS, so I don't get why Apple can't do the same. And I don't get why wanting MacOS on an iPad has to be so unpopular here.


Stage manager is the worst. It’s just a more convoluted version of what we had before.


I’m aware of Stage Manager, but that is a window manager. I’m talking about actual tiling (without space between apps) which they really need to improve imo, in parallel to adding window management features.


Stage manager is terrible


And the other thing.


https://youtu.be/CM3jcGsS0Po


True!  Imagine if they add in a FLIR camera?!  I bought a $150 one that plugs into my phone, but it would be cool if it was just an extra camera on all devices.   Would help us all find leaks and missing insulation in our houses


The differences are mostly for artists, musicians, and editors


that m2 macbook air has me thinking about being a macbook guy lol youre not wrong, the software needs to improve.


Plus porn


Honest answer mines the same


I also don’t understand the point of this device. Macbook Air runs circles around iPad Pro in terms of usefulness. And the Air is cheaper if you add keyboard folio (or what is that thing with keyboard and trackpad is called) to the iPad pro.

Not even mentioning you can’t do anything “pro” on the iPad “pro”. No professional level apps and window multitasking is nightmare.

I know some people who like it but I also know that they use it as just big iPad. The base iPad would work for them equally well.


Just like the Wii


[deleted]


They are very different in use, agreed. That’s why I use a tablet in addition to the phone - but I’ve found that (for me) the tablet things I do aren’t improved by additional screen real estate.

So knowing that my max phone with a triple lens camera is about half the volume of the mini, and knowing they’ve had oled screens on thin phones since the iPhone X, and having a gen 2 pencil on the existing mini… I’m really skeptical there are significant engineering challenges preventing this. I think it’s interest/desire/willpower.

With the 14, Apple has found that sales for the ‘value but big’ alternative are a shadow of the expensive-same size ProMax. 

The 12/13 mini proved that ‘more expensive than the SE but not actually Pro’ doesn’t set the world on fire. 

In both cases, buyers favored the Pro level of power, and paid accordingly.

Apple doesn’t exactly sell top of the line models below cost - I don’t think asking that the iPad Pro be offered in small, medium and large is unreasonable.


It’s an amazing drawing tablet, but just doesn’t work as a solo device. I try to make it work but as a hobbyist who sells prints of their work but I always need to use my wife’s laptop to format the print files and handle the scanning of originals. I know artists are a niche market (and maybe only getting smaller with the onset of image AI) but it’s frustrating that there are so many simple fixes that would make the iPad Pro the perfect standalone device for every illustrator/painter out there.


And you want to do all of that on a 12.9” tablet

Wouldn’t you be a lot happier on a larger display with a mouse and keyboard?

Edit: sorry, you have a MacBook Pro

You’re telling me if you had access to all those things you’d trade your dramatically larger and more powerful MacBook Pro for an iPad?


At this point it just needs to run those apps without porting. No 3rd party developer even cares enough to make a quality Mac port, yet alone a dedicated iPad port. We don't need anymore stripped down ipad photoshop-like ports. Just let us run Mac apps.

I mean from developer's perspective, can you imagine how hard it is to maintain separate Mac and windows versions of their apps that are updated simultaneously and that keep up with OS updates? And now you expect them to do a separate iPad version? For such a low user base that probably has a Mac anyway? This is why apps like Spotify are web-based so they can be easily ported to every platform. And that's why their performance is abysmal while taking up a ton of ram.


That's a very long and inefficient way of doing that. Instead port MacOS to iPads and bam, now you can run every MacOS app on your iPad


>The iPad Pro is a very powerful, app based (as opposed to browser based)computer designed around touch input and a tighter security system.

Uhh, I'm assuming you mean window-based? Unless you seriously just use your computer to run SPA webapps + "native" ports of SPA webapps?

And yeah, I love my ipad, but I really wouldn't be able to consider that device (or any iphone, or even android, really) in even remotely the same category as a mac, or any other desktop / laptop PC. Not without access to the iPad's \*nix filesystem, on-device / local-user developer tools, *actual end-user multiuser support*, and, yes, a true window-based, multi-process UI shell a la macos / windows / linux / xerox.

It's not designed for power users, and probably won't ever be. (ie. apple's old designation for their taditional professional / semi-professional users, who cared about things like hotkeys, automator / apple script, scriptable file operations, And all the other stuff that's builtin to macos and that the ipad doesn't have – or is re-implementing, *poorly,* like keyboard support + standardized application hotkeys)

It's not completely unsuited for professional-ish work if you can find the right app for something, sure, but it's not a computer in the same sense that a mac, or any other PC is in the lineage of the OG Xerox machines, or personal computer building kits / projects / etc., is. And neither is Android, really, even if you *do* have access to many, if not all of the \*nix internals under the hood, if you really want to.


> AUM along with all the effects and synths, Pixelmator Photo, Procreate, Davinci Resolve, Affinity Designer, etc. all get better as the processor improves

Cool.  And how many people will actually notice or care about getting 60 layers in Procreate instead of 40?


Half of those are not pro apps as they are not integratable into a pro workflow. If you can’t use an app to create a big project (like a Hollywood movie) with a big team spread across contents using different computers of different price points, it is not a pro app. 

iPad has plenty of other input methods than just touch. Pencil is just as precise as any Mac input mode. In fact pen is exactly how pro users interact with macs when using tablets, such as when working in photoshop. Then you also have mice and trackpads. Absolutely the same as with a Mac. Really, iPad is only a touch device is a stupid gatekeeping argument forever limiting the device to entertainment purposes. Meanwhile Microsoft is killing it with surface pro while Wacom is killing it with cintiqs.


>	“…it’ll never become a computer.” Is a really lazy, gatekeeping take.

It’s so bizzare continually reading “the iPad will never be a computer”, when I’ve been using it for months as my primary computer without issue.


Woah there don’t go getting everyone’s hopes up, you’re only getting a trade in value that good if you had the 12.9” M2 iPad pro with 1TB storage.


Or your kidney for $299


When I saw Mario Kart on iOS I started daydreaming that they would buy Nintendo. 

It would totally make sense - they both have very tight hardware and software ecosystems.

It would be so good and so bad at the same time.


no shot that chip is fitting in a device that small


Im curious to understand your use case?


Chances are very slim but you never now.


“Graphical user interfaces and mice are cool, but If you want to run professional word processing or spreadsheet software just get a DOS computer”

It’s mind numbing to me that some people don’t see a clear opportunity for combining good input and UX with the software they need. If I am forced to choose between the software I need to work and a great input device, I’m obviously going to choose the software I need to do my job, but why are we forced to only pick one at a time. I have both, but owning both an iPad and a Mac does not grant me the ability to use the Apple Pencil with Cinema 4D and After Effects.


>Device consolidation is a good thing. It's one less thing to carry around, it's one less device that goes to the landfill once it's retired.

Given Apple's (and this sub's) emphasis on environmentally friendly products, it's a bit surprising why both are opposed to hybrid devices. 

One hybrid device would likely be a lot better for the environment than two separate devices.


I would just get a MacBook at that point


[deleted]


Why not MBA? Money printer go brrrr


Why not just get a MacBook Air then?


The comment I was replying to said to toss iPadOS

I’m all in favour of apple giving iPad users the option of booting MacOS

Although that would be extremely messy and unapple like so I don’t see it ever happening and it’s kinda annoying that people keep bringing this up

One thing is for sure though, iPad software is a fucking mess right now, apple has been dropping the ball the last 5 or so years but stage manager is a disaster

iPadOS needs some real love and some radical thinking


Or a pen


I just got an M2 macbook air for work. 

Id argue it’s even more portable than my ipad, it’s the same thickness, longer battery (the thing lasts at least two working days) and clamshell designs are always more durable. 

The biggest thing I want for the ipad at this stage is multiple user accounts, a nice surprise would be running mac apps.


MacBooks can do it already, why is iPad any different? Same processor, lighter-weight OS than MacOS. 

If the processor is too big for the battery, it’s the wrong processor and we are overpaying for performance just left on the table.


Everything got a bump in the pandemic. Even DVDs were selling very well


Sure but 2013 was peak iPad sales and then it declined every year since until the trend reversed in 2020 and they’re back downward trend after the lockdown boost. And laptops did not experience the same “everybody already has one” issue. Apple makes more on Macs than iPad despite Macs having been around longer and lasting longer (not to say iPads are short lived).

iPad 3 taught people that iPads are not much more than media consumption devices, and for all the speed of the iPad, all that’s happened is they’ve become media consumption devices with faster processors.


The Apple Pencil is great for the type of prosumer creatives who are interested enough to draw on procreate but not in such professional environments that they need actual pro software with Mac type workflows. I like sketching stuff out on the iPad from time to time, but when you need to get to work on After Effects or C4D, you’re forced to use the input devices supported on the Mac.

The Magic Keyboard is great for people who have enough money to spend more than a new MacBook Air on creating an imitation MacBook Air without much of the functionality.

I desperately want a Mac with amazing touch/pencil input capabilities of the iPad. Until then my cintiq is the best I can do, but it definitely feels like I’m living in 2010.


I’d say that’s true, to an extent. They’re built solid and as a tablet they function as well as they did new. However, my 2020 ipad pro seems to have memory problems, as browsers can be slow and often reload pages after a few new tabs. Also because of those points, plus being handicapped with iPad OS, I wouldn’t buy another iPad. I’d rather buy a MacBook and keep my current iPad. Then I have a tablet when it’s more useful and a MacBook when I don’t want to be limited by iPad OS (or more commonly, be concerned I may break it by accidentally yeeting the thing off my bed at night).


They last too long because the OS is stagnant


Lol. "Slumping" to $29B/year of revenue, about the size of Nvidia.

And "Slumping" from $21B in 2019 to $29B in 2022. 

I don't think your link shows what you think it does :)

The really crazy thing is an iPad Pro and Apple
Keyboard combined cost more than a MacBook Air. The air comes with double the storage space (256GB SSD) as well.


I mean I’d have to say you’re using it for exactly it’s intended purpose. Purely serviceable camera for grunt work: scanning docs, taking pictures of spaces for clients, etc. 

Just as long as you’re not grandma at your kids tball game holding a giant ass tablet up to take a picture of timmy, I think you’re fine


I would suggest just using your phone which has a better camera and is easier to use.


NGL the high refresh rate is really cool but the fact it has less functionality than a laptop from 2015 despite having a processor that is likely twice as fast is a real turn off. Especially since MS makes tablets that just run Windows.


Gotta sell them keyboards


I decided to try out the magic keyboard on a whim and it hasn’t really detached from my iPad since, but, before that, for many years, what you described was my primary input method and I don’t think many ipad users seem to know about it.


[Yes](https://sun9-46.userapi.com/impg/SkS9uGQgA7568EcFyQ4lHz71D_aMsLQ0b2PGiA/dO0vjjuVotc.jpg?size=2230x840&quality=95&sign=050cc876c70a4733b08b3441b4c0f481&type=album)


True, I though both models shared the same display for some reason


"moving" iPads to their own OS gave me hopes of Apple making iPads actually useful for work outside of note taking. But 3 years down the road and the best we've gotten is working properly with external monitors, and stage manager so you can have more than one iPad open in a window.

There are some more pro apps coming out, but they're still so far cut down from the full PC version that they're mostly just a joke.


Yes, though I can’t say I’ve ever done it with google drive specifically. Every app I’ve ever used has it in the share sheet, which is a system dialog. I actually just tested drive and the issue is that it *doesn’t support the share sheet at all*, so exactly the same problem as on chrome - app developers can choose to sidestep system printing for their own implementation, and google tends to choose to do that for whatever reason. 

I suspect this is a more general interface problem. Even when the implementation of printing is different on macOS, it’s pretty universal to put it in file > print and to bind it to cmd+p, and macOS guidelines allow for exactly that. On iOS the convention for printing is to put it behind the “share” button, but I suspect that Apple does not allow you to use the share button to trigger your own custom interface element, so if a company wants to eschew the system print for their own print, they can’t follow the OS convention and have to do it in an entirely different manner.


Ah my bad. Thought you meant the printing itself. 

But yeah, it should be cmd + p across the board.


1000%


Totally. There’s five (5) current gen iPads as well? That’s too many lol


So what? Microsoft does fine with their Surface pro line...


Your last statement is accurate. Trouble is, a laptop with iPad OS is a god-awful laptop in almost every meaningful way except for the touchscreen.


> Other manufacturers have managed to make 2-in-1 devices work with Windows or ChromeOS

They suck at being a tablet AND suck at being a laptop. They're truly the worst of both worlds.


Merging macOS with iPadOS would be a huge undertaking from a development perspective. They would only do something like this if they’ve already been working on it for more than 5 years. It would be a massive risk for them to bring something like this out and it be less than flawless. They absolutely do not want a Wndows 8.1 on their hands.


And everything else in between.


I get that but the differences are so minimal it’s laughable


Reality Pro porn.


Cool. I use mine on average 4 hours a day, so different strokes. Weird how people are acting like tablets are silly in this thread, they are incredibly useful


Taking a shit with an iPad Pro is way better than with a MacBook Air.


I feel the same way. I have an iPad Pro but I have to force myself to use it. I love using my MacBook Air so much more, not to mention it’s a lot more useful


Yeah, I get iPad. It's a toy for social media, reading books and stuff. But iPad Pro with the "productivity" addons is still a massive crutch due to the HCI limitations. I still feel like in a cage when I use it, treading old, worn paths staked out by Apple and not able to veer off them.

And yes, if Apple made a "Big iPad" it'd decimate the Pro sales because that's why most people get it (even here at work as "pro use" because it's easier to check the CAD drawings on construction sites with colleagues) but that's why they don't do it.


But what can it be used for?   For Art, well yeah, but drawing on paper still feels better.  
Aside from that mainly for note-taking and organization of pdfs and such. So stuff you’ll have to do in school/uni and depending on your job maybe there too. But you’ll hardly find applications where it really is worth up to and more than 1000$ to have an iPad (Pro) at home.  At least thats my take on the topic - I’ve used an iPad(base model - idk why you’d need anything better if not for the 2nd gen pencil) for 2 years now and have yet to find a reason to use it for anything but studying.


Underestimating? Lol. I bought two iPads before getting disillusioned. It's now the correct estimation, was overestimation before.


Somebody said they didn't find the iPad a suitable replacement for a laptop, and you asked what they'd want to do with it but can't. I was answering your own question.


I would absolutely trade a MacBook for that, yeah.


> And you want to do all of that on a 12.9” tablet

> Wouldn’t you be a lot happier on a larger display with a with a mouse and keyboard?

Before I begin, I should note that 1—I'm not the guy you were replying to, and 2—YMMV.

I'd like a device that works with both that *and* a touchscreen + stylus. A mouse + keyboard is better for some of my use cases—typing up film scripts and academic papers in Word, searching Google, tidying up images and video clips in Google Drive, transcribing what someone's saying (often into the IPA or across a language barrier). But I also have a bunch of other use cases—bullet journaling, taking notes and doodles in a class or meeting, annotating & marking up handouts, the occasional form to sign—where I strongly prefer writing by hand and a keyboard won't cut it. Even editing videos, I sometimes wish I could fine-tune a detail with a stylus instead of a mouse.

Screen size? I find that 13" is a Goldilocks spot: laptops/tablets smaller than that can feel cramped when working with small print or fine-detail visuals, but those larger than that are unwieldy to carry in a backpack when out and about, and they can eat up table space. If I needed a display larger than that, I'd dock my computer into a desktop monitor or projector.

> You’re telling me if you had access to all those things you’d trade your dramatically larger and more powerful MacBook Pro for an iPad?

- Lots of people (myself included) are using Intel MBPs that are less powerful than an M1 iPad Pro like what the guy you were talking to has.
- I've also been told by other users in this subreddit who have devices with the M1 chip that it's already a beast, even in devices like the MBA or the iPad Pro that *aren't* the MBP, and that the vast majority of users aren't gonna need the extra power that the M2 chip provides. Your question is like asking why someone would give up a Ferrari engine.


No. He wouldn’t want to do all that on a small iPad. It’s just nitpicking dumb shit


Davinci resolve just ported to iPad


It’s more telling that no matter how powerful it gets there’s always a layer limit. Meanwhile photoshop on a 2005 computer has unlimited layers and unlimited resolution


Your definition of a pro app is ridiculous. Pro apps are what you make money with. Plenty of people do that with the apps I mentioned. I don’t even understand how music performance software could ever be part of a big project with a big team. Does that mean that entire category isn’t “pro?”  

The point is that Apple has optimized the iPad for touch input and the apps are built around that. The giveaway is how the mouse/trackpad pointer turns into a fingertip when moving. Apple has decided to optimize for touch and that has full system consequences. They have gone out if their way to say they will not do what Microsoft has done. I have no idea what you mean by gatekeeping in this context. The iPad is Apple’s computer with a touch interface. And, notwithstanding your ridiculous pigeonholing of what pro apps are, being touch focused has not prevented very capable apps from being released for the iPad. 

If you want a Surface or use a Cintiq you should buy one of those. “Why isn’t the iPad like other company’s products “ should have an obvious answer. Apple isn’t interested. They have succeeded in making a very popular, uniquely Apple product that has a wide appeal with many different use cases. Apparently it won’t be useful for you. Apple is ok with that.


Some people use an iPhone as their primary computer.


you think M3 will be a big chip? lol


Offloading video files in the field


OP said they have a MacBook.

Unfortunately owning a MacBook and an iPad does not unlock iPad input functionality with the Mac software and workflows, and it sounds like that’s what OP would like


If you think of ipad as a thin client it would work better.  I have an old pc and old mac stashed away for remote desktop.  The cost is negligible because these machines are on long upgrade cycles and do not need to be as powerful if they do not run your browser, comms or entertainment apps.


It does, you're just not able to derive trends from visual data.


iPad apps are built for ARM specifically, and Mac at best are designed to use both ARM and x86. So that's it from an architectural point of view. From a UI point of view, the Mac apps are designed around the status bar which doesn't exist in iPadOS and keyboard & mouse interfaces. Those don't translate well as evidenced by every Windows app used on a touch screen it wasn't optimized for. Mac Apps also don't need to prioritize resource consumption to the same extent that iPadOS apps need to.


You may be but I don't know a single other person using ipad apps on their Mac because apps already exist on the Mac for those things. I can't recall anyone even discussing this on Reddit. 

I agree with your confusion but stand by my point.


And the *really* crazy thing is that—depending on your use case—the iPad + keyboard might still be the better device for you. 

It doesn’t have Mac OS. But it’s extremely versatile, has numerous features/capabilities that the Mac doesn’t have (and vice versa ofc) especially if you have the pencil too… But even some of the things that both can do will present a superior UX on the iPad. Again, it depends on the use case.


I don’t doubt for a second that Apple is acutely aware of this pricing comparison (which indeed appears strange, at first glance), and has put serious thought and planning into why they’re priced the way they are. All depends on the individuals’ use case; that will decide if double the storage for less, Mac OS, & other factors attract them to the Air, or the versatility, touchscreen/pencil capability and etc. attract them to the Pad… they’re quite different devices which may be better matches for different types of people/use cases


It’s been a while since I’ve seen this as I haven’t done much touristy things in the past several years, but a pre Covid trip to the  Baltimore aquarium had just that. People walking around taking photos with their iPads.


I do a lot of the time, although sometimes I might just have a show or a YT video running on my iPhone while I’m working on my art, so it ends up being more convenient to just use the iPad so I can keep watching my stuff. Besides, I don’t really need the high definition most of the time as much as I just need my outlines or whatever design I whipped up to paint over.


Surfaces are bad tablets IMO. In offering two different UXes as a single unified OS, they let developers get away with only supporting one, and the experience suffers. They’re fine, great even, for using occasional touch as a supplement to a mouse and keyboard experience. But as a touch-first or touch-only experience they’re really lacking because you have to spend so much time in interfaces that aren’t well optimized for touch. That ranges from layout and click-target size, to responsiveness to touch in general. The iPad is a much better mouse and keyboard experience than the surface is a touch experience.


Because windows is the only OS they have. It just wouldn’t make sense for them to develop a new OS for the Surface, people would also have to adjust to that. Apple on the other hand kept iPadOS very similar to iOS, so I don’t think the iPad was designed to be used as a Laptop until the iPad Pro with the keyboard came around. You also have to consider that a vast majority of people owning an iPad do not use it as a Laptop-like device, but as a media viewing and creativity device. MacOS is counterintuitive to use for all those people. You could argue that a higher percentage of iPad Pro users use it as a Laptop, but then it wouldn’t make sense to also implement this for all the Air and base iPad users. And MacOS just for the Pro iPads would be a huge inconsistency across the lineup, and that would draw many people who like iPadOS away from buying a Pro, or an iPad in general.


I beg to differ. I actually think they work better than traditional laptops/tablets that only work in one form or the other.


I’ve actually had both experiences myself. I had a first gen iPad. Used it for a couple years as a novelty and then it sat on a shelf. 

Then I picked up the M1 in 2021 and it has become my go to media device. I use it daily and I love it. I’ve never loved them as productivity tools personally, but I love it now that I think of it as simply my relaxation device - news, magazines, reading, YouTube, streaming, drawing, some games, etc.


Tablets are fantastic, it's iPadOS that is "silly". It's not even silly, it's down right awful. It started as a bigger iPhone/iPod touch 13 years ago and maybe then it made sense when an iPhone and most phones had 3.5" screen. Now phones are huge and there is not much need for the tablet to use as bigger phone. People want to use tablets as more portable computers and they fail at that due to limitations imposed by its iOS origin.


It’s not that deep bro


I think it depends what you do. 

For me I tried to get my iPad to a state where I could use it for remote development but I never could so it fell into disuse. It's basically a drawing tablet for my toddler at this point. 

If it could do more, like be a tablet mac then it could be a great supplement to my MacBook Pro as I could use both for development wherever I am.


How do you use it for these four hours? And browsing social media better not be your definition of use.


I have a MacBook Air, an iPad Pro and an iPad mini. 

The iPad mini is the one which is best suited to shitting duties. 

Please don’t ask me how I know.


Yeah but not much better than a phone or disconnecting altogether while, ahem downloading your daily poo


No kidding.

It’s not like people haven’t had plenty of time to use iPads over the last decade plus.

We all know what it can do and the answer is mostly the same stuff the iPhone can do + Apple Pencil.


How do you know what they want to do but can’t?

Or are you simply providing me a list of apps and differences between iPad and Mac

iPad and Mac are different products though no, shouldn’t there be differences between them?


My point exactly. One app. We had full clipstudio paint ported some years back too. No pro will change their workflower around what few apps a device supports. It is the device that will be chosen based on the workflow dictated by the task or the employer. For me my employment requires me to use Maya, photoshop and storyboard pro. With occasional after effects and premiere. None of those are available.


Lol, could you imagine a Mac with that exact same M1 chip having a layer limit of 60.


What software do you use to make it a thin client?


[deleted]


I own an M1 MBP and an M1 iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard… I never touch my Mac anymore, and the combined iPad + Smart Keyboard blows the laptop out of the water for me.


But they could give you both in the Pro. iPadOS and MacOS. Switch to MacOS when an external keyboard is detected for example. Or just let the user decide....


Same, and additionally I do college tutoring on the side and it’s incredibly useful to be able to set up anywhere I want in 2 seconds and be able to charge from a battery pack instead of an outlet. Great for video chatting with the fam too.

Yes, a laptop can absolutely do all of these things, but it’s not nearly as convenient, and that’s why I love the tablet. It has a lower profile and it’s incredibly responsive and has a better screen than equivalent laptops and doesn’t light things on fire or have an obnoxious fan.

I wasn’t sure how much I would like having a tablet, but I love it, esp with WFH. It follows me around the house all day and means my office doesn’t have to have a TV in it either


What about iPhone vs iPad Mini for taking a shit? The competition is tough.


I know what you meant, though it technically has more to do with ram. But still, insane limitation of iOS to not allow virtual ram. Like how do you even come up with that limitation and think it's ok to have it on a pro device.


Because you can't fathom anyone disagreeing with you or because you struggled to deliver a snarky response and this is the best you could come up with?

I vote both.


Some people in here is just explaining why the status quo got to being here and others are imaging what could be better.

Two different conversations


Two OSes that switched between one another when docked would not be the nice experience people seem to think they would be. To make a user experience that would be even remotely Apple-like they’d need to effectively make a new OS that combined the UX and features of both, i.e. exactly what Microsoft did with Windows 8.


The device has to be small enough to hold in one hand, but not so small that it can fall between the legs if dropped.


I guess when your legacy is the iPhone you end up with quirks that make sense on the iPhone :/

Tomorrow 😱


no iPhone but iOS 14 the VERY next day???

&#x200B;

ok i'll take that


Is this the first time they announced it comes out TOMORROW?? Don't we usually have to wait a week omg


Very strange to have an iOS release with no prior GM release (unless they seed that today, I suppose). Interesting year!


Was really hoping for an macOS update release, too.


I just finished watching the Events and I didn’t know if I heard that correctly. Awesome!


iPhone user me: hell yeah! 

Developer of Halide app me: oh god what the fuck tomorrow fuck fuck fuck


My ipad air 2 from 6 years ago is still getting major updates, thats crazy


[deleted]


[deleted]


It's funny. With the AirPod Pro update yesterday to add spatial sound I was all excited, then realized I needed iOS 14 to use it. I didn't want to put a beta version on my daily phone, so I was bummed. But look at that, two days later than the AirPod update. 

I wonder if anyone predicted the iOS update coming so soon, actually. Because with my hindsight glasses on, AirPod updates can't be forced. You've got to be charging them in close proximity to your phone and it just kinda happens when you're lucky. So depending on how often you use your AirPods, you might only charge the case every few days. Release the AirPod update two days early, by the time the iOS update is out, users have probably charged their AirPods by then and didn't even notice they updated. So they pop them in their ears with their shiny new iOS and look spatial sound is available.


I just got the ipad pro and never had an apple product before. When exactly are the updates released? At midnight?
I'm from Germany btw if that makes any difference

It’s September 16th already here...


Devs on Twitter are surprised and pissed for having almost no time to prepare for app release

The general expectation is a 1-2 weeks heads up for major iOS releases, but this release is in less than 24 hours

Plus, there is no Xcode GM (yet), so if there is no release between now and 1pm ET tomorrow, no app on the App Store will be optimized for iOS 14. It would be like running a beta OS with many apps not running correctly and/or crashing. I think Apple did a big mistake here.

GM out now


Is it the special ios that will fuck up Zuckerberg's life?


testing in production is always fun


I just checked my settings and iOS 14 is already available for me to install. Is anyone else seeing this? I was part of the public testing beta.

Edit: Should’ve sorted by new, found my answer!


Let’s fucking go!!! Amazing surprise


Used to be a phone service rep. For gods sake backuo your devices first. And may God have mercy on those reps.


I was literally in a meeting telling my project sponsor that the new versions typically come out late fall and it shouldn’t be a big concern as this was announced lol. 

Boy I looked stupid thanks apple!


I’m pumped to one star review every app not ready. Buckle up devs!


RIP my iPhone 6S


Don’t mind me. I’ll just be sitting over here waiting for a month or so before updating.


[removed]


I love iOS launches lol, first one we got hyped for was iOS5.


Thanks for the birthday present Apple!


Coming to 50 min late now...


Still waiting and checking the update section. No luck

Pokémon Go still doesn’t work with the latest developer beta. They better get an update out there quick


Pouring one out for you tonight, Federico.


What time is this being released ?


any idea what time today it drops? usually in the morning or afternoon?


Earlier than I thought...


So I’m one of those guys who buys the newest phone aaaand then holds on to it for a long time. I’m on the 8 Plus still and I’m starting to think that this might be about the time to stop updating it. Was there any word on how much processing power it’ll take to run 14 and how well an 8 can handle it?


Its already September 16 here in Australia 🇦🇺


I know y'all hate Microsoft but take a sysadmin's advice from the Windows world on this one: Wait a month and install it in October, you won't regret it.

You'll be in a world of hurt if you install a .0 release, especially one randomly coming out tomorrow when no developer is ready.


**APPLE:** \[Ships new versions of iOS in mid-to-late September every year, like clockwork, for most of a decade\]

**DEVS AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 2020 EVENT:** "HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY HAVE EXPECTED APPLE TO SHIP iOS IN MID TO LATE SEPTEMBER?!"


Wait... no Big Sur tomorrow?


Here’s my current iOS 14 beta setup for anyone looking for inspiration 

https://i.imgur.com/jachmmE.jpg


Anyone running iOS 14 on 6s Plus? How is it?


Don’t forget to charge your iPhones ;)


Really surprised there was no iPhone announcement today.


And how many updates will it take to get it working right? 13 was a fucking disaster and the last update still broke more stuff. Plus what the hell will it take to get Bluetooth working right?


Can some share the time at which it will release in different locations . I can’t wait !!


Which iPads will get iPadOS?


Still no available in Germany.


Why don’t I see the new iOS update?


THAT’S TODAY


Does anybody know what time iOS14 will be available?


Today!


It isn’t our for me yet 😔


Uh, what? I sure hope not.  Widgets are **still** incredibly buggy for me (on the latest beta)


I know most people are probably looking forward to iPhone 12 the most, but to me, this is much, much more exciting news.


No notice to developers whatsoever - there isn’t even a final release version of Xcode yet


> A redesigned music app


Ugh omg not again I *just* got used to the last update fuckkkk stop “fixing” things that aren’t broke!


Huh I live in Australia so I already have it


Please realise this is satire


So why is everyone on twitter saying its a bad idea and not to update?

How do i upgrade from the beta to the public release?


All the devs that have iOS apps must be pissed AF


GM released


Apple kinda gave this away last night when all the major apps had updates available at once.  It's not every night \~40% of apps installed have an update at once.

That's normally the clue you're < 72hrs away from a major OS release.


O.o

Let's see how badly this goes


[deleted]


WHAT THIS SHIT WHERE IS UPDATE???


And tvOS, too, no?


Woe


I don’t think many developers are ready to submit their apps yet. I feel like the number of beta apps that I’m testing that support iOS 14 features are WAY less than the number of apps that I was testing that supported iOS 13 features at this point last year. Maybe it’s due to COVID 19. Maybe it’s due to the amount of work. I dunno.


Probably the best thing to come out of the Apple event hehe. If there’s one thing I’ve missed about android it’s the weather widget+clock in my home screen


Hey that’s when my milk expires!!!


Interesting since I just got an alert today for 13.7 and installed it


Looks like MS Metro UI to me. Glad they finally caught on to how dope that UI was


**The new Scribble feature of iPadOS 14 lets you “write by hand in any text field across iPadOS, and your words automatically convert to text.”**

THIS is what I’ve been waiting for


Might be a silly question but will IOS 14 run ok on an iPhone 8? I had my iphone 5 slow down to the point of it being unusable after all the updates.

I’ll wait and see what the verdict is after it launches of course, just thought I’d ask around now, It looks super cool.


I’m not a dev and I signed yo for the iOS 14 beta. Will I even have to download anything tomorrow?


AND YOUTUBE STILL ISNT IN FUCKING 4K ON APPLE TV


I’m feeling sadistic and I’m gonna update both of my devices tomorrow at the same time. Usually I wait a week or two.


Does anyone know what time this drops? Midnight?


what time EST? (approx)


What about watch OS 7?


We time can we expect it?


Today😱


Can someone recommend that in my iPhone X, a fresh install from iTunes is recommended or OTA update is also fine?


Is there an expected release hour?


Is the german "corona-warn-app" work with iOS14?


Hey guys! My iphone is on 13.5 and I know that on the new macOS and tvOS our AirPods would automatically switch to whatever’s playing. 

My question is, would I have to update all my Apple devices (iphone, Apple TV 4K, MacBook Air) to the latest os for AirPods switching to work?


I will probably upgrade tonight. Give it a try. I am due for a new phone so it’s nice to try out OS upgrades before getting the new hardware. 

I’m hopeful we still get a new phone this year... getting worried.


When are they going to drop sleep analysis update on watchOS?


Can confirm, not much changed from the beta. That said, there was probably a horrible bug at some point that I didn’t notice


https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/16/when-download-ios-14-ipados-14-time-zones/

Estimate times for those with poor Google fu.


Let's hope they have fixed all the bugs this release :doubtful


How dumb is it Spatial Audio does not work on my two year old Ipad Pro.. ridiculous!


Is the update available? It says up to date (iPadOS 13.7)


Where is the update lol


Wasn’t it supposed to be updated Sep 16 1pm EDT for Toronto? It’s only 13.7 now


Which is kind of crazy, I'm on the latest beta release (Lost track of which one it is exactly), and this joint does not seem ready for public release.


So does 14.0 include the anti-spying features, or did Apple cave to Facebook?


As a beta tester I'm not confident enough in it yet. I know they've got their own version of it that isnt in the public beta but I'm on the latest beta version and they haven't seemed to work out kinks on applets and stacks. I sometimes get blank / black screens and a few apps haven't integrated with the new OS yet. I expect a rickety launch


Mobile Nintendo fans are going to be sad when they realize that Pokemon Go and Animal Crossing Pocket Camp don't work


if we're on the public beta does it automatically get updated to the release version?


When’s Big Sur coming out?


Always happy for a new update 😊


Ngl I’m using the iOS14 beta rn and there are still a lot of bugs


Serious question. How many applications will not work correctly as of tomorrow? Are we safe to download?


Where is it then? I’m in uk.


The only update I’ve ever been excited for, can’t wait


Lmao its 05 and still no update for me:(


Huh, my guess was a release today, given that we just got new AirPods firmware that requires 14. Close!


Like last time, I will wait for 14.1.


They haven't even released GMs to the beta testers (guessing those are coming any moment now). They've never gone this quickly before.

EDIT - GM is available.


/r/tomorrow


What time does it usually release?


In Seinfeld Mimbo’s voice : “how about manana?”

Me : manana Im doing nada


The rumour is new iphones will get 14.1


Yeah I’m excited by this. I’ve been too busy with work this year to even worry about the betas, and I had pretty much forgotten all about it. I’ll take this as a consolation prize in the absence of a new phone this month.


also bionic a14


This event was suppose to have iPhone also. I guess something went wrong because of Covid and now they have to wait for October to have stock. iPad has to be release yesterday because of schools starting.


part of me wonders if they dropped it because they knew everyone was going to be bummed about the lack of iPhone announcement


It's out today!


what's that GM?


will probably release Big Sur in October with iPhone keynote and rumored MacBook release.


I wish we also got Big Sur tomorrow, but I guess we have to wait a little bit longer on it.


I'm assuming it's because Big Sur is still riddled with bugs


“And lastly ios14comesouttomorrow, goodbye”


I had to rewind it a couple times to make sure I heard it right 😭


One of those things where you’re so busy padding your speech to reach over an hour but 10 mins before you give it, you forgot about one of the main things


Halide! You guys rock. Best camera app for sure and probably one of the best apps period. So much attention to detail and UX.


Hahaha


Love the app. Thanks for the work


You’ve got 24 hours to verify performance! It’s like one of those eighties action movies.

I’m also surprised. I thought Apple wanted more time with a GM out themselves to ensure there aren’t any late showstoppers.


lmao thank you for your work on such an awesome app!


Just checked out the app and saw on your twitter you teased Halide Mk 2. Is this being planned as a separate purchase or an update to the current app?


Hadn't heard of Halide, but I've been a Camera+ user for quite a while.  Looks like Halide might solve some of the Camera+ issues that've always bugged me.  You just earned yourself a sale.  Now if somebody could combine all the best features of Camera+ and FILMIC Pro into one app, I'd have no use for the Apple Camera app anymore.  

(And I'm going to judge you harshly if iOS 14 causes any problems.  You had 24 hours notice.)


Look at the plus side, maybe those cruel App Store reviewers will go easy on you iOS devs and just auto-approve everything over the next day or two as all the panic updates totally inundate them.

The other upside... if you ship a bug, you can just blame Apple for the next couple weeks. And all the other apps are gonna be broken too, hah!


I really enjoy Halide. Thanks!


Anyone who is reading this who doesn’t know about Halide: it’s a very solid camera app with lots of manual controls. If you care what your photos look like beyond normal snapshots, Halide can improve the photographs you get out of your iPhone.


Question, why should I use a 3rd party camera app instead of the default?


[deleted]


Halide is getting a lot of praise for making a high-quality app (and rightfully so), but they also seem to be a quality operation [all the way around](https://mobile.twitter.com/halidecamera/status/1304152039283478529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1304152039283478529%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2F2020%2F09%2F12%2Fhalide-camera-app-sees-big-spike-for-wildfire-sky-photos-donates-sales%2F).

I don’t use mine a huge amount but it feels like it hasn’t slowest down at all and doesn’t struggle with anything, I can’t see myself replacing it until the updates stop. If they keep supporting it another 4 years I bet it’d last.


 That's because unlike Android, Apple does not abandon device update when a gadget is two years old.


Any idea where I can get  list of devices that will support 14?


I’ll tell you the best thing that’s on this beta besides widgets. Picture in Picture videos, you can watch videos from YouTube while browsing Reddit.


On ios14?


Crashes on launch here


Check for updates in the App Store, Niantic has now published an update to PoGo for iOS 14: https://twitter.com/NianticHelp/status/1306052356711223297


Have anyone tested on the GM?


Germany usually gets them at 19:00.


Probably early evening in Germany as we are several hours ahead of the US where it’s likely to be released around morning / noon.


With Apple everything’s at 10am PDT, which is GMT -8hrs. Germany is GMT+1hr so it’s 7pm.


Make sure you have a backup before you update. Just a good bit of advice if you’ve never done it before.


Probably not much more than usual, loads of people buy new phones at Christmas and the new iOS usually comes out a few days before new phones anyways doesn’t it?

Heck, maybe people will have time to get used to iOS 14 and and thus the new iPhones will feel like an even bigger deal because they won’t  have new features to look forward to for another year unless they upgrade. Hard to say.


I think most people that were going to upgrade to a 12 still will. The top draws are no doubt the body redesign, available sizes and 5G support. 

I’ve got an 11 but will wait a few months and for when the 11 series shows up for the Apple Giveback program for a trade in, unless a family member wants it maybe.


So how’s iOS 14?


I think it’s 10AM PDT usually


To everyone saying ‘they’ve had since June’ you’re missing the point entirely 

The current version of Xcode is a beta, meaning you can’t use it to build apps that can be submitted to the store. Now every developer has to patiently wait for the final version to be released, download and unpack the damn thing, and then crunch all night in order to get their apps submitted in time for tomorrow


there's been a beta for like 3 months

Edit: OMG ok I get it


I’m a dev. Any dev that isn’t ready for this already is pathetically stupid. We’ve had several months of notice to prepare. If the new iPhone was announced, it’d be launch next week with iOS 14. 1 week wouldn’t have saved them. They’re to blame. Not Apple.

Edit: for the GM remarks, a “good dev” is going to be testing on every new beta release. They will also be testing after launch despite GM results. GM is a hell of a lie to convince yourselves by.

Edit again: y’all who can’t figure out how to submit an app for iOS 14 is your own problem, not mine or Apple’s or, I don’t know, the tons of others who have had no problem doing so. I know Google is hard to use guys, but come on now.

Edit again: the GM [has been] up. Awaiting more excuses.

Final edit because I’m going to go eat and not revisit this topic later: notice all the people attacking me based on claiming I said things I can’t even find a reference in my comments to. Like the idea that I *wasn’t* using a GM with my builds. Or the assuming of when those builds took place. Grudge over me saying that regardless, you should have been ready for iOS 14 launching about this time like it does every year? Haha okay.


[deleted]


They’ve had since wwdc?


Well. GM just dropped.


I work for a software development company and there’s no panic on our end. We’re a Mac/iOS first development house and have all been on or had access to the beta of both Big Sur and iOS 14 for months. We even have several Apple Silicon test devices for working on future Mac releases. I don’t think this should come as a big surprise to even moderately prepared companies.


I’m absolutely furious at them. I’ve been working to get an App Clip out for my client. Working in good faith, even communicating with Apple and my leadership about marketing goals, and they pull this shit?

I’ve had bad experiences working for day 1 new feature releases before, but this is the last straw. Apple can go fuck themselves.


It's a developer-hostile and user-hostile move. We've seen a lot of that from Apple lately. All while they introduced new services offerings which will raise more anti-trust questions. It's like they're begging regulators to smack them around.


Damn, hate to admit it but they were right. No iPhone today.


I'm glad, because now I can safely spend my money on the RTX 3080 instead of a new iphone that I don't need.


tbh i think we'll be pretty disappointed now that Ming Kuo has joined the no 120 Hz party


Searched for this comment just to upvote


I couldn’t agree more. God bless them all.


This guy fucks.


Ah are you paranoid of updates just like me?


Just back it up before. What’s the problem?


I think they are deploying it in batches to not overwhelm their servers


Nope, they [delayed](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=hx9s63c5&1599152522) it until the beginning of 2021 to give devs time to update their apps accordingly. 

Other [sites](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay) covered it as well.


It still has the microphone and camera notifications though


They won’t. It’s par for the course with PoGo


Probably 10 PST


The 8 can handle iOS 14 no problem, at this point it is very polished (much more so than what iOS 13.0 was like). Even on the iPhone 6s, iOS 14 runs great, at least as good as 13, if not better.


Another anecdote, I was running the beta on my 8 until two days ago. The phone feels great performance-wise, but the battery life was really rough.


SE checking in.


I’m still using a first gen SE and it runs perfectly


I hear you. You’re completely right. But lord knows when I see that update button I’m pressing it immediately. I am not wise


This is great advice we just can’t take.


Haha iOS update go brrrrrr


[deleted]


>	You’ll be in a world of hurt if you install a .0 release

Rarely trust people who speak in absolutes. I get your point, but this has been in beta for a long time. It’s stable.


Honestly, I will wait 24-48 hours and then download it.  Wait for the internet to tell me if it’s stable or not.


> take a sysadmin's advice from the advice from the Windows world 

No. Windows and its perverse atrocities has severely damaged human software interactions. Memory micromanagement, update avoidance, clean installations, rebooting often... the list goes on and on. Totally unnecessary if you’re dealing with any decent software.


That’s true only if your iPhone or iPad is your main device.


I just reverted from iOS 14 beta to iOS 13 two days ago because my entire watch app was broken.

I’m waiting until 14.1 at least because there’s no way this is ready


It’s not about the release date, that was expected. It’s about the time between GM and GA release. There is not enough time to test against the actual final version that’s going out to consumers. 

Stuff did change enough between the last beta and GM in the past to break apps. They also screwed up at least once where there was a major bug in the GM and they had to release a GM2.  

Now there is no time for developers to do a last, final quality check om both their own apps and iOS itself with the actual version that will be released.


Bless you

It’s not released till later today! Depends on what country you are in


Because developers don’t have a GM of Xcode to even start preparing a final release of a software version no one’s used yet, let alone even a GM of iOS 14 before its officially available.


No public gold master testing.

It should do it automatically. With beta profile, your device will have the lastest software avilable, and tomorrow iOS 14 public is the lastest avilable.


I'm already seeing the public release/GM in my Software Updates menu


My advice is to wait a few days or a week for everything to settle, there’s always something bad that happens on the first day


Can't seem to get it here in Perth :(  
Will keep trying.


Yes. tvOS 14 GM seed already available for developers.


Planning to buy the pencil for my iPad 7th generation. Love this feature.


They beta ran great on my 8, just battery life wasn’t great. 

I think I’m going to wait until 14.1 but performance was not an issue


8 more minutes


7 isn’t the latest


Delayed til 2021 sadly


The GM that’s up now is tomorrow’s release, so yes - just delete the profile to get back on the train. 

Except don’t. Without a doubt 14.1 will follow fast with massive bug fixes and you’ll want to get on the beta as soon as possible.


Yeah, no mention at all was a bit surprising. I think this might mean there's Apple Silicon hardware to announce next.


I would expect it in October mainly because Catalina was released in October last year. That would be my guess


You’ll be fine


Probably around 5pm today for the U.K.

I just got it


what is GM


We – developers – only got messages saying TODAY that we could submit our apps for iOS 14 now...


I think they want people to test and use their own widget first and then start allowing devs to publish their own


And quickly there was another version of Xcode GM. But fuck it, let’s do it live

1PM ET


Usually around 10am Cupertino time


Smells like the same release schedule as the iOS 13. 
Wasn't 13.1 available like a week or two after the initial 13 release?


Just have to wait for the new iPhones...

Gotta say I’m real salty we didn’t see them today.


It makes sense to keep 14.1 for the new iPhones. You can better hide things in the software that would give away the details.


It’s probably because the watch is coming out soon and needs an iOS 14 device to pair to


Oh, nice! Thanks for the heads up.


Im rocking it. Love the widget stacks. Really annoyed that the calendar widgets show tomorrows events rather then todays events.


A golden master build (GM) is typically the final build of a piece of software in the beta stages for developers. Typically, for iOS, it is the final build before a major release, however, there have been a few exceptions. 

From "Google"


It’s essentially the version released to consumers — in Apples case it has the same build number as well.


Makes sense.


every year they always release slightly later than the ios releases anyway.


Shift the bulk of the devs to finish Big Sur now


Big Sur still has bugs so they will not release it yet.


This rumored macbook. Is it with apple silicon or is this the last intel gen macbooks?


What are the rumoured Macbook releases? Is there a new 16" MBP rumoured?


[Well they did try to warn everyone](https://i.imgur.com/icZFMlh.jpeg)


You think so? Is it any better than Catalina? That was a dumpster fire for me.


Yeah that’s basically how it happened. Tim Cook had like a 90 second thing talking about it. Kinda weird lol


That’s exactly how it happened too.

Thanks so much!!!


I’ve really got to learn this app.... I always just use the stock app..!


Thanks so much!


Lots of pretty important stuff in there too, especially with regards to fine grained permissions. Let's hope we do OK!


Nah, this was known for a while from the earlier betas. The problem now is that there’s like 18 hours to build with the GM and get through review.


Haha thank you!


We can't say much about it yet!


Haha thank you, we hope it'll be smooth.


Need more information. I have the app; what kind of photos? Close photos of people / objects or landscapes? I need to learn the app better.


Thanks so much :)


hows the battery life?

That's usually the first thing to go.


Same, I'm still using mine for hours every day. ZOOM meetings, web learning, PDFs, browsing, video player. Everything works flawlessly. It even has a better display than the newest standard Ipads (laminated, anti glare).


The list has been available since iOS 14 was publicly announced. For future reference, it’s always on the bottom of the iOS version preview page: https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14/

Dankeschön. This will prevent me from checking for updates every hour or so.


Basically ios13 but my Memoji now has more freckles


Thank you!


Yep.

Nothing like having a single day (really just half a work day by the time the Xcode 12 GM presumably drops later today) to have stuff submitted to hopefully go up tomorrow!


Do their apps absolutely *have* to be ready on the day that the OS update rolls out?

What’s the harm for devs in just pushing their app updates a few days later?


> To everyone saying ‘they’ve had since June’ you’re missing the point entirely 

This is /r/apple, loaded with armchair pundits who just think Apple is the bee's knees who can do no wrong. Also screw Epic Games mirite?


Welp that’s just life, sometimes you have a time crunch and just gotta grind 💪
/s

As a consumer, I’m elated to have iOS 14 tomorrow. Though I can see why it’s bad for developers.


Everyone saying we’ve had since June aren’t just missing the point, they are completely and absolutely fucking clueless of what they are talking about. Smdh.


But the normal process is to release a GM ("Golden Master") that's the same as the upcoming public release so devs can test against the final version of the OS.


Also iOS updates are basically always in mid-September, right?

EDIT: I have been informed that Apple did not make the necessary tools in Xcode available to developers this time around.


It's not about how long the beta lasted (3 months is fine) but about the weird choice not to give devs a chance to:

* Test their apps against the final build instead of the beta

* Submit their final builds to the App Store review ahead of time so that they're available when the new OS rolls out


developers usually get the final release version 1-2 weeks in advance, save for a few minuscule fixes. there could be changes to the developer tools which are important for developers to know about and act on before their final ios 14 submission to the app store.


Devs can't release apps that target iOS 14 though, they can only update them through TestFlight. And there's no guarantee your TestFlight users will be on a beta version of iOS to help test your app.

The best a dev can do before a GM is out is making sure their app doesn't crash or do unexpected behavior on a beta iOS, otherwise devs can't implement iOS 14 features until usually when the GM is out.


Yes but the general expectation is a 1-2 weeks heads up for major iOS releases


Dev here, just installed the beta two weeks ago because I couldn’t just up and stop testing on the release the entire rest of the world uses. Trust me when I say developing an app where your only test device is a buggy in-finished OS is a bad idea.


Don’t you love when you already have a dozen comments giving you the same answer and someone comes by to tell you the exact same thing!


>Any dev that isn’t ready for this already is pathetically stupid.

So wanting to do full regression testing against the version that will be available at launch is "pathetically stupid"?

You might have your app ready but many companies like running final quality checks against production like build to ensure a better customer experience. Right now they can't run those checks until the GM is available.

A "good dev" doesn't assume that because it worked on the previous 5 betas that it's guaranteed to work on GM.

edit: typo


Okey? So where is the GM of Xcode so developers can test their apps with the final release that is tomorrow? Can’t hey even submit their apps right now?


Oh yeah? So you have XCode 12 no Beta? Tell me more...


Normally they release a GM which can differ from earlier releases. If you're a dev that cares about your users you'd really like the opportunity to test against the final release before it goes public.


Yeah, one thing is complaining about no GM period where they can start submitting apps and whatnot. But it doesn’t excuse not being ready when iOS has always launched at around this time.


Wrong. The GM typically fixes loads of bugs that existed the entire cycle. Also the Xcode GM initially uploaded was WRONG and didn't work lmao they literally replaced it already. Apple is just disorganized and dysfunctional. This is awful.

Also if you're on Big Sur you can't use the GM. Stick to beta 6. Complete clusterfuck.

>	I’m a dev. Any dev that isn’t ready for this already is pathetically stupid.

How did you, since you’re so smart, get an advanced copy of the public release version of iOS 14 for testing?


[deleted]


On previous iOS releases I've had things break between final beta and gm release. So while our software currently seems fine on the final beta, this situation isn't ideal. Now, instead of a week, we have a night of frantic testing, to make sure everything will be fine when millions of people suddenly have an updated OS and we don't know with 100% certainty that there won't have been bugs introduced. 

I'm not upset or pissy about it but it is a small pain with the potential to be a massive one.


Is there any speculation on when they are planning to announce a new iPhone?


3080? What are you poor? You need a 3090. /s


So you're just buying whichever releases first? Not which product you need more?

Go ahead and buy that RTX 3080 becuase they didn't announce the phone today. But don't be surprised when you still want that iPhone 12 when it releases in a month


Yes. Yes I am.


Still new to iOS. I always forget that back up option!


Ugh, I was looking forward most to this feature.


This sounds good to me as I'm still on a 6S. But this is also the year I am thinking of finally upgrading. My battery life just sucks so much now.


Awesome! Thanks for the info!


Earthquakes tend to be more stable than Windows releases.


FWIW, I downloaded the beta 7 release about a week ago (on beta 8 now), and the only app that doesn’t work is Pokémon Go for me. Granted I don’t use a crap ton of apps, but all the big ones, FB, YouTube, Apollo, all the main Google + Google Office Apps, everything works just fine.


You also have to consider the wasted work if you started doing it so early. For example IDFA. You would have had to spend cycles working on that only to find out Apple is postponing that until next year.

Then there are 3rd party dependencies to consider as well.


Ah, perhaps I delete the beta profile? Then the official ios 14 public version will appear.


Yeah, recent iOS launches have been a mess and this will probably be worse because of how quickly it was announced


Will Craig write it as it goes live?


LIVE FROM SOMEWHERE CALIFORNIA ITS SATURDAY NIGHT ERR SORRY, IOS14

I'm a web developer and I completely agree. Finding out that the new version of Safari shows up *tomorrow* was a little surprising.

Yeah, all the iOS devs on my twitter timeline are pissed


It's basically exactly a year since iOS 13 launched, not sure why anyone would be surprised.


Yea, very sudden. They usually give us at least a week to submit before release. I was hoping they fix the AVPlayer for SwiftUI, but they didn't.


Yeah, I had to rush test one of my client's apps on the new build. Thankfully no issues, but still, a little annoying to have to do things last minute


I think this is Apple’s way of saying this is the new norm.


I think this quick draw update is solely a privacy reason. Here me out. 

We’ve known that 14 was going to ramp shit up with notifications of 3 party apps trying to do shady shit. I saw it myself a LOT on the beta. With Apple not announcing a further out deadline/release date for devs, that doesn’t give a lot of those guilty apps I witnessed breaking privacy to somehow circumvent the new changes.  

If they Apps don’t change the business as usual way by tomorrow, they are straight up getting called out non stop by iOS letting the user know that the problem all is doing something shady. 

I’m sure App Devs will find away around the restrictions, but for the next few days, it could be a bit Wild West out there thanks to those new privacy features.

"Gold Master". In the old days it meant "This is the final version of the software that we're sending to the CD printing machine." Nowadays it's just "this is what's getting pushed to the masses".

13.1 was released so quick because iOS 13 beta was released as iOS 13. Funny thing is that they still kept releasing betas as official releases up until 13.3. Yeah I’m joking but iOS 13 was very buggy because it was rushed


My screen’s fucked and I didn’t want to spend the money to have it replaced thinking new iPhones are on the way. I’m super bummed out.


Bingo


I asked siri. She told me about the car company

And that’s fine. If they need to take their time to polish the OS, then all the better for us.


eh, if it's anything like iOS 13 shift the bulk of devs to hotfixes 1-88 that will come out this week lol

Hello Stephen Shankland


It's doing better than Catalina at this point in the beta cycle, but worse than Mojave. Taking a few extra weeks is definitely the right call if they have the option.


I thought Big Sur was terrible. At some point I started getting constant graphics firmware kernel panics to the point that I had to wipe it and go back to Catalina. And then woops, I install Catalina and they're still occurring. So it wasn't Big Sur. At that point I thought it was a hardware issue related to my crazy ex throwing it out of a three story window a number of months back. As a last ditch effort I remembered resetting the VRAM and PRAM can fix some issues. And low and behold it did. Still annoyed at myself for not thinking of that before downgrading. I had some important files I wasn't able to backup because they wouldn't finish copying before the next kernel panic.

But other than that completely unrelated problem Big Sur was great. It was the first time handoff between iPhone or iPad actually worked like you imagine it should. The app you would be using would pop up instantly. I want to reinstall it, but at this point I may as well wait.


Yeah it caught me off guard too, I had to check Twitter and this sub to confirm that I heard correctly.


I impulse bought your app because you commented here. Looks cool and the stock camera is so feature poor


It’s worth learning. It’s the analogous to working a SLR. The controls you want feel like they’re just under your fingers and not buried under menus or dialogues. Ok the other hand it doesn’t lend itself to discovery as much. But once you know it, it’s just work and feels really responsive. 

(To given them extra credit, apparently they donated sales revenues to wildfire charities because they realized they were profiting from people buying the app to get better pics of wildfire cityscapes)


We're working on something to help with that. Stay tuned :)


Well, hope you like perpetual screaming for 18 hours!


Alrighty, I'll keep my eye on it! Thanks for the response.


You can control focus, white balance, ISO manually. Manual focus on the iPhone is just awesome.


I think I charge it about once a week with a bit of use most days. It’s probably got worse over time but it’s definitely not a concern yet.


Holy shit iPhone SE 1st gen (2016) & 6s/6s+ (2015) still supported? 

And people say that Apple doesn't support their devices long enough?


Awesome, thanks!


4 burner stove top I have a feeling. Also widgets


I just tried PoGo and it’s still borked on iOS 14

There are a number of issues.

From a technical perspective, you want to test to make sure your app works on the "GM" version of the new OS prior to its release so you can push out any fixes. Sometimes things in the OS change so that the app won't function properly anymore and needs a fix. 

From a business perspective, it's about marketing. iOS has a bunch of new features people will want to explore. If you have an app on the AppStore that takes advantage of the new features you're more likely to attract attention from users who are looking for that at release rather than in a few days.


Users will update the OS and expect apps to be taking advantage of the new OS, and be ready for it. None of their apps will be able to, they'll blame developers. Missing features, bugs, incorrect functionality, etc.

It's actually a very developer-hostile and user-hostile move by Apple.


I don’t develop on Apple stuff, but usually a Major version update implies breaking changes from previous versions, otherwise it would be a minor update, so it could be removing API support for things they were using and break the app.


There could be some breaking changes or small annoyances in iOS 14, for apps not built for iOS 14 (i.e. the Xcode GM).  So there's a change lots of users will upgrade to iOS 14 tomorrow and use an iOS 13-built app from developers, experiencing issues.


I would assume in case their app crashes on iOS 14 immediately


Apple changes stuff all the time with these releases. Things that worked will break. It's not about being ready for new OS features (though there is that too), it's about making sure Apple didn't break anything that will cause your app to crash.


Apps will be unstable, crash, or will have unpredictable issues.


i hate this sub sometimes. its like its full of braindead apologists whose entire lives revolve around apple worship


Yes but just because something "normally" happens doesn't mean it doesn't still require planning to execute. At this point, there are not even GM tools available to build iOS 14 apps yet. 

It's possible that a GM of XCode will come out asap today and some devs will have the bandwidth to pivot and get a quality release out the door but not knowing it was coming tomorrow will throw the roadmaps of a lot of teams off.


Pretty sure


It's not like devs can magically guess what'll break in iOS 14 without having access to it even if we can guess the date.


I’ll do you one better. 52 weeks heads up, iOS 15 will come out this time next year.


‘QA is overrated” Same guy that wonders why his app dies on launch on iOS 14


> I "good dev" doesn't assume that because it worked on the previous 5 betas that it's guaranteed to work on GM.

Have experienced exactly that myself. Working though the betas, then boom.


If they do, good luck unzipping the file in time for release lol.


100% of people complaining are complaining about not having a GM period. The length would've been if they had told us a week ago.


I've seen rumors say October 12.


Idk, my guess is somewhere in October or November.


October.


Apple told investors that the iPhone would be a few weeks late but wouldn't miss holiday sales, so sometime in October seems likely.


October

Not to mention that not even app developers were prepared for it dropping either, which could cause some problems...but then again it did take a while for apps to integrate dark mode for iOS 13 so this isn’t really anything new


When you click download, Craig will remotely connect to your device and write the code for it.

Unfortunately no, it has a terrible strain on the the developer’s wrists

What does that MEAN?


/r/thatsthejoke


Bless you for being a web developer that acknowledges Safari exists. 🙇🏻‍♂️


Is Xcode more enjoyable than your other work and Java?


They're devs but... haven't tried the betas on their test builds? Or are they expecting some sweeping change between the last beta and now?


Because usually Apple releases the GM and a new Xcode a week ahead of time during which developers are then allowed to submit apps that support iOS 14  before it rolls out to everyone else.


Usually they release the GM for a week before they transition into the official release.


Yes, but it's also pretty standard that they give a week's heads-up so devs can do a final round of testing and know when to submit their builds for the new version.


[deleted]


But a developer shouldn't be relying on leaks and rumors lol


Nope, it was because it wasn’t ready in time for the new hardware.


Why not just get it fixed? 

It would increase the resale value by at least the cost of the repair.

I’ve never really understood that mentality, people do it a lot with cars too, they don’t maintain them or clean them properly because they’re getting rid of them, and then have to take a absolute bath on it’s resale value in excess of what they saved. 

The stuff I own often reaches it’s best condition in anticipation of me selling it, to do otherwise is to leave money on the table.


Honestly if we saw them today they wouldn’t be ready until next month.  I am on a 7 plus, on it’s second battery and I am having trouble with my charging port now.  So I am really looking for an announcement.  I held hope it would be today but I realized it probably wouldn’t and it’s kind of lame.  But who cares I don’t follow all these Apple events anymore I just pay attention when I need a new device and that’s losing them money because I’m less into updating when I don’t necessarily need to and just no longer waiting for it and lapping it up
When it comes.


Same here (i7). Replaced it with a lousy one from Amazon and I was ready to preorder de new one ASAP, but no luck :(.


Yup, I’ve been waiting months with a cracked phone that keeps restarting.


Should have asked "Hey Siri, what is GM in software development" :)


Heh that just reminded me of everyone trying to update to iOS 7.0


its expected too, macos is a lot more complex too


It's not my screenshot


Does Big Sur still do that thing where they will verify with a server before running each application?


Yeah. I mean, I’m on the beta anyway so it doesn’t really make a difference to me, but it was just really quick for some reason.


I usually hear the opposite, Apple is pretty well known for long device support. 

The list of macOS 11 officially supported Macs includes 2013 models. That’s pretty damn good considering how much of a major change Big Sur is.


[deleted]


Generally things aren't removed. If your app was built with the iOS 13 SDK it *should* just continue to work as if it was still on iOS 13. (Of course, Apple can mess things up, which stinks, because it's not your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it.)


>At this point, there are not even GM tools available to build iOS 14 apps yet.

Fair enough to that one lol.


As a dev, these comments piss me off so much. It's like you think no work has been done on iOS 14 updates and devs are pissed that they only get a day to do all the work. 

Even if your update is 100% code complete you still need time to test the code against the GM build to ensure nothing broke since the last beta build you tested against. You also still need to have access to the next version of Xcode so you can actually submit the update for review and Apple needs to have time to review and approve the update. 

Every team out there knew iOS 14 was coming and most have their update ready to go. What they didn't know what the exact date the release was going to happen so they couldn't plan for the last mile.

Teams often have other priorities so it's not like they finished the update and then are just sitting around doing nothing until Apple tells them to go, they have other work they are now having to slam the breaks on to meet Apple's timeline. 

Rather than having a few days to a week to test their app updates (which again has likely been done for a while) and get it approved they now need to rush to try and do it in under 24 hours. Testing isn't the easiest task so having a few days isn't an unreasonable ask.


And when will Apple release the final version allowing devs to make sure nothing has broken in that release? Usually we get a week or so with the GM. It's happened that the GM has broken apps which were previously working. 

When will Apple allow devs to submit apps for iOS 15 to the App Store?


Yeah, the non-devs on this thread seem to think the complaints are from devs who haven't even started on their updates yet. They don't realize that testing against GM is an important part of the release process and takes time.


Good luck downloading it, pretty sure Apple servers would crash today


No way would be in November.

There's no WORDS on it


lol 🤣


FUCKIN THING SUCKS!


I mean... On iOS every browser is just safari with a skin


iOS makes up over half of mobile web traffic (there are more Android users but iOS users browse more). You'd be in a pretty bad spot not to acknowledge Safari.


Safari is the most used mobile web browser in the US.


It would be much easier to acknowledge if it was available on more types of devices. It can be tough to convince management to get developers a Mac just so they can iron out issues that usually end up having one-liner solutions.


Is Xcode not enjoyable to you? I mean, other than Visual Studio, and maybe IntelliJ with Kotlin, Xcode is one of my favorite environment to work in


They've all been working throughout the summer, but behavior is different across betas. Usually you'd want to spend a lot of time testing your app on the GM, which is the exact build that will go out to consumers. That GM just dropped today, which doesn't give enough time to test before it goes live to users tomorrow.


I just never resell them. But I do agree with what you’re saying.


Not sure what model he has, but I have an 11 Max Pro with a busted front glass right where the camera is and the last quote I got for a replacement/ repair was $800 because they can’t just replace the digitizer. The entire display must be replaced too. 

Right to repair should come quicker and force companies to make it fairly easy to repair things like this. Just seems like a ploy to not allow someone to fix it themselves.


Well this is what I got [as a result on my macbook](https://i.imgur.com/YePtYDV.png)


Nice try Stephen


Yes, app notarization is still a feature in Big Sur.


I’m not, wish I was but I can wait until tomorrow. What are your thoughts on ios14, what do you like and not like about it?


Only if you do everything the Apple way. There is always a fair amount of custom code to get things to look a a certain way or minor changes to expand on something Apple has built in. 

I been bit by an fing nav bar button in the pass that was a crashing issue.  Work fine for 2 versions and hell even worked fine on a beta release but got screwed by the gold master.  
Fix was easy but figuring out that was it and doing thebrefactor to do it like Apple wanted not so much and was a rush job.

Right now I am glad what I am working on is not going public for a few more months so I do not have to deal with the mad scramble right now.


That's the real issue here. Good developers should have been testing on the beta for months now, but they've been unable to submit app updates for iOS 14 yet. So they may be ready to go, but they have to wait for Xcode to come out of beta before they can even submit the iOS 14-ready version of their app. And then it has to be reviewed before it goes live. Think that's all gonna happen in less than 24 hours for thousands upon thousands of apps?

Honestly I have no idea what Apple was smoking with this decision. Users will update tomorrow and find some of their apps no longer working properly, through no fault of the third party developers. It looks bad for Apple, and it looks bad for the developers.


Hey, also a dev. I get all the issues with just now getting a GM, I'm specifically responding to the comment about "a 1-2 weeks heads up". I've been involved with the planning, development, and release coordination of iOS apps for years, and never once did we wait for Apple to explicitly tell us there would be an iOS release in September.


But should we still delete the profile tomorrow and after we download the GM? I don't want my phone to keep getting beta versions of incremental software updates, like 14.1, 14.2 etc


[deleted]


Wow! Is that still the case? I thought that happened early on but they later allowed browsers to use their own engines.

Edit:

It sure is still the case: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/

2.5.6 Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript.


Internationally? Almost impossible to believe when apple has very little market share in india/china and that's 2.5 billion people


I'm not a programmer.


I heard from someone on the beta that the last build (I think PB7 or PB8, can't remember) had an "a" at the end of the build number, so the build going out today is probably the same code just without the symbols and debugging stuff in it.


Apple has generally not given much time on GM in recent years. Not sure why some developers are acting surprised. It's been a single day in the past too.


Apple stuff retains a weird amount of value.

I wouldn’t sell mine either if people didn’t keep paying like $200 for EOL phones.


gosh Siri really does suck.


Lol


I stole it from CNET https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/5BVX3gfaUJSgSlQiZIbc-CaE83w=/940x0/2020/06/23/09275c9c-f3cc-40f0-93fa-e4e121fa4334/20200623-wwdc-big-sur-bug-sur-typo.jpg


Damn. Might have to stick to Mojave.


Could you elaborate on app notarization?


I was composing a response to you; but it turned into an essay, so I just made a post about it. [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/itjl5e/my_thoughts_after_living_on_the_ios_14_public/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) the link


Right. I'm used to seeing "updated for iOS xx" before the update is out but I haven't paid attention to my actual updates for ages now since they're more hidden in the App Store. Ergo, I was not aware the tools necessary weren't available this time around.


Going to say you do not work in the enterprise world. It is very clear you are doing the internet bs. I have been doing iOS development professional for years now and at big enterprise level. Yes we plan on it. We do spot checks during the beta to make sure there is no crashes. Getting a release out in less than a few days just not going happen. Validation for a release takes hours from with the CI machine finishes. We do not push builds up from our own machines it is all threw CI. Getting that machine update in under a week is a huge lift. Mix that with other work it is insane.


If only Safari for Windows was still a thing for those devs who don't have Apple devices.


They still have jobs?  Our web traffic went 30-40% mobile safari like 5 years ago.


Yeah, Safari has ~49% in NA (~55% in USA), but only ~22% globally.


That’s not true, they released the iOS 13 GM a week before the public release and that’s been the norm previously, too.


I got the company schedules nearby on iOS so yeah it sucks. useful for telling the time tho xD


So it’s yours?


Clever boy Stephen, clever boy.


I don't imagine that "feature" is going away anytime soon...


Previously, when running an application on macOS, the OS would check if the developer was verified, then run the app.

In Catalina and Big Sur, the OS instead checks for an app-specific signature by Apple, called a notarization. This new implementation has a number of security benefits:

* Notarizations can be pulled instantly by Apple, unlike the old system. If you’re online, your OS will contact Apple’s servers when you run an app to see if the notarization is still valid.

* When an app gets notarized, Apple gets to scan it for known malware techniques. This allows for some level of proactive blocking of malware.

* If an app is modified, the notarization is voided. This prevents attacks where an app is modified by a third party to include malware.

You can still override the security system by right-clicking the app and clicking open.


Thank you, I appreciate it.


Ugh. I recently joined a site to get online tutoring jobs, and they ONLY let you log in when using Chrome. No other browser is supported. They shouldn’t have a job whoever that is


Probably because all iOS web browsers are just using WebKit anyway.


No i just thought that was funny I'm not OP.


So if you right click and open, no problem right? Why would people stick to Mojave because of this? Also thanks for helping me out lol


Anytime!


At least chrome works. At work we run software that requires *internet explorer* in fucking 2020.


Don’t blame the developers. Blame management.


Yeah, sites that only work with one browser are the absolute worst. I had a class last year with an online component that only worked with Internet Explorer lol.


I was also joking because your username fits (maybe you knew that)


Newsroom Link: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-m1-chip-and-stunning-liquid-retina-xdr-display/


Looks like we're sticking with the M1 branding/chip selection rather than A14X.

Curious where they go from here. A15 / M2 next year; yearly A-series with M-series on a slower cycle; M2 in *everything* next year with minor tweaks for each device.


I suspect we're gonna see big changes on iPadOS 15.


Happy to see this but performance has never been the issue with iPad. Now more than ever, iPadOS needs to be much more than it is now. Otherwise , it’s just power wasted.


So there goes the argument that it's impossible to run macOS on the thing because it's different hardware.

C'mon Apple, let me run whatever I want on it, give me virtualization support!

Parallels on the iPad would be quite useful.


Can we get that 1000 nit display on MacBook Pro, please


[deleted]


That surprised me.  I wasn't expecting any M-series chips to go into any iOS devices.  I had assumed that the A-series and M-series would continue on parallel tracks.

I know Apple has long maintained that iOS and Mac OS would never merge, but I can picture a future OS that supersedes them both and runs on on everything from the Mac Pro to the Apple Watch.


I’m pissed the 11” doesn’t get the XDR screen

Edit: God this is such a first word problem


[deleted]


Excited for it to be hobbled by iPadOS

Edit: *Take your Pro Display XDR workflow on the go!* ^*without ^your ^entire ^pro ^OS ^lol


Cool, m1! They need it seriously fix the files app to be able to take advantage of that though. I’m getting “content unavailable” bugs that have been in there from the introduction of the files app. Kinda hard to do video editing when you can’t access the files. Also, another well known bug is all AU audio apps go missing mid-session and you have to restart to show them as installed again. Pretty sure both are related to number of apps installed and number of files in the files app.


for sure a giant leap forwards for the iPad pro, but i hope the move to include an M1 chip signals something big coming with iPadOS 15 or apple's gonna have a tough time justifying why someone should drop the same amount of money on a 12.9" iPad over a macbook air with the same chip yet capable of running so many more of the apps which creatives rely on every day to get work done, until then this thing – amazing as the iPad Pros are as someone with the 2018 12.9 which still holds up as an absolutely superb tablet –  is just an expensive overpowered toy which can't really be depended on in any real capacity as a creation device.

when even apple doesn't even think its own pro apps are suitable for running on a supposedly 'pro' iPad, why should developers? even the ones which have made it so far (photoshop, illustrator) are pared down barebones versions of their mac equivalents and even the most competitive video editing apps available really being unable to hold a candle to the apps they're trying to emulate.


Wow this caught me off guard!


iPad OS makes these performance improvements pointless. To this day, simple tasks like saving a PDF from an email or organizing files and documents is made obnoxious because of how clunky iPad OS is. And multitasking with multiple open windows is also annoying on iPad. All the power in the world packed into the iPad will never beat flexibility and convenience of non-iPadOS computing devices. I loved my 2018 iPad Pro, but I still always use a Windows-based computing device any day for accomplishing actual work, simply because file management sucks in iPad as does working with multiple windows open at once. IPadOS basically needs to become more like Windows. Otherwise for most people the iPad is going to be a cool fancy device to watch YouTube videos on or reply to texts.


Let me run MacOS on it and I'm in


It still runs iPadOS. iPad Pro needs to run macOS this is actually ridiculous at this point. It has thunderbolt 4!!? To transfer what? Files to the hobbled files app in iPadOS? Hardware is totally wasted on iPadOS.

Edit: it’s also portrait oriented!!! The camera is still in the portrait orientation!!! Every demo shows it in landscape. Make it a landscape device already what the hell?


People in this thread complaining about OS but me over here dreaming about bigger procreate files with more layers. 🤤


Overpowered, crippled by software until Apple does something revolutionary with iPadOS 15. On a positive note, it will be future proof for years to come.


Lol at comparing the M1 to an 11 year old tablet to pad those numbers.

edit: MORE FIGEE


Mini LED only on the big model sucks.

I’m in the market for a new iPad and I would’ve happily paid the premium to get the 11” pro instead of the Air, but I don’t want to go up to 12.9” and spend an extra $300 (on top of the extra $200 from Air -> 11” Pro).

Photographer and Filmmaker here... Sorry, M1 and XDR display is cool, but if it runs iPadOS still the specs at this point are irrelevant. Hobbled by a watered down version of Adobe Lightroom and Ps is a complete joke, no FCPX or Premier, no full desktop versions of any Pro apps.

If you make iPad apps you can't even use Xcode and design them on an iPad. You'd have to buy a Mac just to make iPad apps.

I'm struggling to see why this is an upgrade over my completely already overpowered 2020 iPad Pro that has the same software limitations as the 2021.


Something big coming with WWDC if the new iPads can have up to 16GB of Ram


What's the point of M1 on iPad Pro but still stuck on iPadOS? Just get a Macbook M1, just for the RAM alone.


i'm just buying this to watch shit on YouTube

Holy shit, thunderbolt too


Lots of people in this thread assuming Apple wants you to buy 2 devices. Sure that's probably part of it. But the App Store is their golden goose. That 15-30% revenue cut is probably way more valuable to them. Opening up the iPad means a risk to that revenue stream.


I’ll be very surprised if these devices aren’t running MacOS this Fall. Way too powerful for just iPadOS.


Hopefully this lays the ground work for a big iPadOS revamp in June WWDC. Possibly limited just to M1 iPad Pro though…..


$1,799 will get you the one with 16GB Ram…ouch


First time I’ve ever seen them officially declaring RAM for a product. Up to 16 GB of RAM. 

Looks like a fantastic piece of hardware. State of the art. But that was never the iPad's problem. This still doesn’t solve the substantial gap between the amazing hardware of their mobile devices and the software in their traditional Macs (Pro, Air). I hope that’s rectified during WWDC or early fall.


Severely disappointed they didn’t put the mini-led display on the 11” version. Guess I’m waiting another year.


> This means the iPad Pro can now drive the Apple Pro Display XDR at full 6K resolution.

Ah, nothing like hooking your iPad up to your $5,000 display and getting a letterboxed 6K image.

I really hope iPadOS 15 brings proper changes to display support on the iPad Pro.


I don’t understand why Centre Stage is a feature for the easily movable iPad Pro but absent on the big desktop iMac where it would be surely be even more useful?


I Bought an Ipad pro 12.9 3 months ago, now I don't care about the chip but the display... FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF


Where is the mini 🥲


I have the M1 macbook air and I really can't think of a workflow for an ipad pro for my needs but I REALLY want one.


JUST MAKE A TOUCHSCREEN MAC!

Edit: higher price then the MacBook Air oh my god


Wow such a powerful hardware running iPad OS 😂😂😂


Jesus Christ, 1,099???


16 GiB RAM is only available on the 1TB and 2TB version. You get 8 GiB on the lower spec ones. 
It‘s kinda sad but memory wasn’t that much of an issue on iPadOS anyway. It will help with larger projects and is a nice addition. I just would’ve preferred if the memory wasn’t bound to the disk space. 

I like the Mini LED on the 12.9 inch but I hope that the 11 inch will get the same treatment soon. 
The finger print reader from the iPad Air is missing and that’s a bummer as well. 

I guess the iPad Pro just isn’t for me. I would stick to the iPad Air.


The only bottleneck it will have is iPadOS😕


I wonder how it compares to the current A12Z


Any word on RAM improvements? I'd kill for an iPad Pro with 32GB of RAM, but Apple so far has not offered more than a paltry 6GB, which is, I assume, why they don't even list the RAM in their tech specs.


I bought a Pro after they updated it last year, currently on suicide watch.


And it has thunderbolt!


So I wonder, is the large spacing between menu bar icons in Big Sur a sign of MacOS coming to touch screen devices?


$799 for 11 and $1099 for 12.9


Looks very decent but nothing there to justify an upgrade over my 11” Pro for my use case, which is just web browsing and content consumption such as YouTube, really basic stuff that my 11” Pro still excels at. I’m very happy with my iPad. Apple makes great tablets.


WWDC is going to make or break this iPad. I imagine they’re going to make this even more macOS like during that event. I have a 2020 12.9 Pro and I just hope they don’t restrict the OS features to only work with these new ones.


Wondering if FCPX might be in like to be available on the bee IPads given it’s spec?


M1 on iPad Pro is so eye watering

I feel like they really want iPad Pro to be the gaming sector for m1 and MacBook and macs can be for creative suites therefore they don’t feel like they are abandoning games


[deleted]


Full display out with no black bars and macos support is all I want from Ipad to make me upgrade.


Until iPads are on iPadOS m1 is useless, previous gen weren’t suffering from performance in any shape or form. Bring macOS on iPad


I feel like they are going to have to make this thing dual-bootable, right? I mean, adding the M1 chip and Thunderbolt... it's basically a MacBook Pro. It seems totally overpriced for an iPad but if you could boot into macOS when needed, then I think this would be an amazing option.


Yeah I can use finally use FinalCut on my iPa.....NOPE PSYCH! LUMA FUSION FOR YOU


$200 difference between the wifi-only version of the iPad Pro and the wifi+cell version? that's horseshit. has there even been such a huge upcharge for cell? I don't even care about the ability to use cell towers, all I care about is the built-in GPS receiver.


The camera is still in the wrong place.

All marketing show the ipad in landscape mode.

99% of the time, I use my ipad pro in landscape. All accessories (covers/keyboards) only work in landscape mode. 

100% of the time I use the camera the ipad is in landscape orientation.

&#x200B;

Centerstage and facetime "maintain eye contact" is just fancy software trying to address a hardware issue. An easy one at that!  


Not replacing my ipad as long as the camera stays put. Absolute insanity.


Is the new iPad Pro 12.9” display have 120hz refresh rate?


I’d buy one if they went all in on it and let it function like a tablet/laptop hybrid similar to a surface.


I’ve almost been LOOKING for a reason to get rid of my mid-2015 MBP but I just can’t find it amongst the iPad lineup.


Great. Now put macOS on it and call it a day.


[deleted]


Did... did they just mention the iPad Pro RAM?!?!?!?! 

[this is huge]


I’m looking forward to preordering mine.  
 
My 3 year old iPad Pro 10.5” is comparable to a used 1993 Honda Civic with the check engine light on with all the overheating, ridiculous battery drainand crashing it’s been showing me.


up to 16gb Ram and no way to use it


Impressive, wtf, new iPad OS is coming strong


It’s time to change the name from “iPad Pro” to “iPad+” or something. They wasted so much potential, most importantly it’s not running any “Pro” software despite having M1. I’ve been waiting for it to run logic and final cut for 3 years now. I’m not upgrading until it lives up to its name.


Prices?

I see them now that Apple store is up again. Thanks folks!


Up to 16GB of RAM!


For a full fledged pro device the hardware is now here but iPadOS is not, let's just say as a big iPad fan this WWDC I will religiously listen to the ipadOS segment.

A little heartbreaking to see the 11" without OLED or mini-led options but it was expected, I guess with limited logistics and the size of the device it was not really possible.


Imagine if you can dual boot this with ipadOS and macOS. That would be insane. IpadOS when you just wanna do casual tasks and watch shows. MacOS when it's time to edit videos and run codes. It's basically an m1 macbook air without the keyboard.


The ad was fuckin nuts and AWESOME tho


Will take some amount of magic at WWDC to convince me all this power is necessary on an iPad. What I want - MacOS virtualisation on the iPad so we can do serious work. What we’ll get - XCode and Pro iPad OS Apps on the iPad now that it has the M1.


As some one who owns a 2020 12.9 inch iPad Pro, I am confused as to what the difference between the m1 chip and the current chip in my iPad is. Honestly sounds like a rebrand of the chip since the 2020 iPad is already over powered as it is.


All that for ~~a drop of blood~~ iPadOS 14


Since the iPad now runs on M1 would it be possible to run macOS?


so much power and for what?


Im probably only going to use it for netflix and porn with my wife but im gonna buy the 16gb 1tb drive one anyway.


Doesnt look like i'll be upgrading from my iPad Pro 2020 with A12z


ITT: Apple releases an iPad with better hardware than reddit predicted and everyone is miserable about it.


Everyone’s asking why they can’t run Mac OS on an iPad Pro and here I am wondering why they refuse to put 5G in a MacBook that has now has a 20+ hour battery? Come on.


5G!?!???!


At this point, the iPad Pro is becoming really close to be a MacBook Pro substitute


M1 on an iPad sounds insane, but it also seems like overkill because of the limitations of iPad OS. I really hope Apple makes a Surface-like device, they can dominate 2-in-1s so easily I don’t know why they haven’t yet.


Too bad it doesn't run MacOS.


I just want to point out that the top of the line iPad is now $2399, or $2877 with a keyboard and pencil.


They're allowing for upgradeable RAM, that's a curious decision considering that IPad OS isn't taxing enough to warrant an upgrade. I'm guessing they have something planned for WWDC


8gb ram till 512 go, 16gb ram for 1tb/2tb models


I love the form factor and the magic keyboard is so much prettier than MacBooks but god damnit let me code and use actual programs, otherwise this is worthless.


My question is: will the iPad Air 4 have a lower price ? Haha :D


Anyone surprised there’s no battery life increase?


Which storage option has 16gb ram?


Does anyone think we might finally get XCode on iPad?


The iPad screen is exciting! I hope they put it into a larger MacBook Pro. Would make it a godly tool for color grading.


What desk that the guy is using with the yellow iMac on the iMac page?! 👀

I actually have the 2019 iPad Pro and I don't feel like I'm missing anything. The M1 is so much more useful in a laptop or desktop.


What’s the use of Macbook air, mac mini then?


I’m out of the loop, 
is there a close competitor that is running something better than the iPad? It’s a nice big upgrade but didn’t know we needed it.


Hard to get excited for the hardware when they keep blue-balling us with iPadOS.


On the website it say battery life is still the same at 9 hours. Was hoping to see a bump in battery life, I’m constantly charging my iPad Pro


Wow $799 11" base model has 8GB of RAM, and $1499 11" model has 16GB of RAM. I don't even know what I'd do with all that RAM on iPadOS.


I bought an iPad Pro 11" when they first came out. I use it for browsing and note taking.

You may not need an iPad Pro.


Is there any reason to even consider MacBook M1 laptop, now that this iPad m1 is out?


Damn, this is actually making me rethink the Macbook M1 I just purchased that is on the way.


This is not even funny anymore, at this time, ipad is lapping the nearest competition and more. I won’t be surprised if they start closing their iPad competition businesses. The 12.9 version also establishes the fact that you want Mac only for MacOS and not for any hardware feature. There are no hardware advantage with Macs, its a pure software play.


I'm on a tight schedule and was wondering what "second half of the month" meant. Does it just mean it ships May 15-31? Anyone have any guesses from previous preorders?


I smell xcode for iPad being a possibility now🥰


All I could think during the keynote was, “who is this for?” That’s a lot of power, but for what? It’s still held down by iPadOS. If this same machine ran a touch-enabled macOS, then that would be compelling. But with iPadOS, it’s just insanely overkill and a total waste.


I love to draw in Procreate, so obviously this is a very nice little unit and quite appealing.

But the 12.9 inch costs twice as much an an iPad Air, which is also excellent, so it's hard to justify this.


I wander if we can install MacOs BigSur in an ipad Pro as Virtual Machine.  That would make it a perfect iPad for me.

Sorta like this thing:

[https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/)


Still rocking the 1st gen 12.9” iPad. Been looking for an excuse to update it but this is still not it.


Okay that's cool but I still can't even import 4k60 video in iOS yet.

Despite my 2020 pro being able to record 4k60 video itself. Ludicrous.

If you won't let me run Mac OS, at least include basic features that would make this tablet actually useable as a "pro" device.


I’m going to get down voted for this, but hear me out...I don’t think Mac OS will be coming to the iPad as I assume they will want to keep these eco systems separate, but with the whole native app thing, if the make Final Cut Pro/photoshop (Desktop) work on the Mac with M1 there is quite literally nothing stopping it working on the IPad with the M1 chip, and I feel that’s what this is going to be scoped at. I would take that all day.


I have a 2020 WiFi only version and was thinking of upgrading to a 2021 cellular. I’m mainly doing this because I find myself needing the iPad more and more outside of the house with no WiFi networks nearby to connect to. With carrier offers ($200), Apple trade in ($500), and student discounts ($50), I’d end up paying $200. The cellular plan would only cost $5 a month for unlimited data with my carrier. Is it worth it?


Question: in the announcement they showed the camera would auto zoom and pan to keep you in shot during FaceTime calls. Is this also true for the new iMac or just a iPad only thingy?


is miniLED supposed to be the tech thats better than OLED without the burn in? If so this is a huge step.


Any reason they didn’t add the Touch ID? I thought it was coming back after they added it in iPad Air. I hope the next iPhone has it.


I'd bet my left ass cheek that they're sticking with A-series chips for iPhones and regular iPads, and M-series chips for Macs and iPad Pros.


Can someone explain to me the difference between the A-Series chip on an iPad and the M1 on the iPad?

Is it purely branding?


[deleted]


They better do buff the system by a lot, otherwise the Pro will stay being a regular iPad on steroids.


Yeah I bet they'll do a toggle between iOS and macOS UI depending on whether a keyboard and mouse/trackpad are plugged in.  Maybe the new iPad has a sensor to determine when the iPad is docked.  Basically a Surface Pro but a better tablet.


They can make the chip as fancy as they want but the software is the main problem. iPadOS is too clunky


I think a hybrid OS should be ideal for ipad pros with M1 that you can switch if you want to like DEX on samsung(It is not well polished and not a true hybrid OS on samsung btw).


**Power wasted** should be the tagline for every iPad Pro ever.


trees disagreeable snails dependent wrong squeeze tan profit deliver vanish -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/


I’d expect some big iPadOS announcements at WWDC.


They really need to give users the option to just run full macOS, perhaps through virtualization with files shared between iOS and macOS.

Jump into macOS when you need a real computer, and leave iPad OS as the tablet oriented OS

Or just do something like Samsung Dex and give you a desktop experience when you plug in a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.


Completely agree here, I have the first 12.9" iPad Pro and I don't think I've ever experienced a performance hitch at all. But they market it and price it as a "PC replacement" and it's just not true. I was expecting them to announce that it dual-boots MacOS and iPadOS, or at least introduce a slightly more expensive model that runs MacOS instead, and it just didn't happen. It would've been the perfect time to begin to merge the Mac with the iPad.


RAM has for sure been an issue for me for a while. It majorly caps the size of artboards and the number of layers you can have in apps like Procreate. Having up to 16gigs now is a game changer for the work I do on the Pro.

Also in 3d modeling programs like Nomad, stuff like voxel remeshing is gonna benefit majorly from the specs in this thing. Complicated brushes in Photoshop will be a lot smoother to use, Illustrator will be able to handle way more vector points, video editing will be much faster. I also expect announcements WWDC to continue to bolster the Pro use cases for these things.

So when people are saying that these spec bumps don't make a difference, perhaps it doesn't for them and that's what the lower tier iPad models are for. For me, this update is a big one.


My 10.5” Pro has an A10X but it lags terribly for whatever reason


Agreed. Hopefully there is another shoe to drop at WWDC.


iPad pro’s been a mile ahead of its software since that second one they released (the new form factor after the massive-bezeled monster).


I’d buy one in 5 seconds if it had mac os. Same since DAY 1. Still just use iPad mini until something as powerful and flexible as a laptop comes in tablet form. I don’t need a bigger phone that isn’t a phone.


Well with the M1 chip we should theoretically be able to run OSX M1 equivalent apps right? Maybe power will be utilized there


My biggest issue is music production, either a DAW needs to make a decent port to iPad or allow Mac programs.


XCode! Now there is no reason not to lol


Parallels or any VM software would kill my need for a laptop for essentially forever. Use iPad as a mobile device and fire up a desktop OS only when needed, then go back to mobile.


I mean that argument already didn't work, developer kit Mac Mini used an A12Z from the iPad


The argument was never if it’s possible. 

The developer transition kits were built around the same chips in last years iPad Pro. 

The argument is if it’s a good idea, good strategy or something  Apple would even consider doing.


[removed]


At this rate the next ipad will be a quantum computer but won't be able to run xcode.


If they add MacOS support to the iPad Pro, I might begin potentially caring about the iPad


I own an iPad Pro 2018 and an M1 MacBook Pro, I love both devices and have different uses for both. MacBook for work as a web designer and iPad for entertainment. There are a lot of overlapping uses but neither device could replace the other. 

But, if one day i could fire up a virtualized MacOS with external keyboard/mouse on the iPad, then I think I could use just one device for everything I need to do.

Having the iPad running on MacOS all the time or having a touchscreen Macbook is not the ideal solution, but an iPad that can “convert” into a full fledged MacOS laptop would probably be the solution. 🤔


I'd love for this to happen! 

I don't really have a use for a Mac, I'm a heavy pc gamer so I have a gaming pc and a laptop is not something I have a need for, either privately or in my profession. 

I like the iPad but I find it rather limiting because it's basically a bigger iPhone so I instead have the largest iphone available and do all my couch surfing on that instead. 

If they were to port MacOS to the iPad pro if you have it coupled with a keyboard and mouse, or the magic keyboard case, I'd buy it in a heartbeat!


Comment has been removed because Spez killed Reddit :(


No.


I think they're always gonna reserve the best screens for their XDR display and Ipads, although I could see IMac screens being improved, although not to the extent of XDR


$3000 take or leave.


Is there different version of the m1 chip or are it’s abilities the same whether it’s in a iPad or iMac?


[deleted]


God, I wish. That would absolutely make me buy it.

So far, I don't believe any vulnerabilities with M1 have surfaced. You almost definitely need a hardware exploit to run MacOS on the iPad, but with a software one you might be able to virtual machine into it.

Dualbooting iPadOS/MacOS would be the dream


This is my issue with ipad pros.  Amazing device but holy shit the OS holds it back so much.  I'm just not a fan of ipadOS.  It's basically just ios with all the same limitations.


That’s certainly a logical way to go... but then why did they forked iPadOS from iOS? 

We went from iOS & MacOS to watchOS, tvOS, iOS, iPadOS & MacOS. 

Are they going to bring it back down to just one OS eventually?


Mini-LED is still quite new, it’s probable they don’t have the yield to do both sizes yet, or it would have pushed the cost up too much.


My thoughts too. That 12.9” is just too damn big.


Honestly there isn't much that justifies getting the 11" pro and not the iPad Air, other then the chip and 120hz, but really, an A14 is already really good


I read that they had issues with the supply chain, so maybe they had original plans to include that XDR on the 11” but had to scrap that idea?


Yep, looks like I’ll stick to my 2018 11”. If they made the ipad pro run macOS I’ll probably jump to the 12inch but as it stands the ipad is still mainly a tablet for me and 11” is the perfect size for a tablet/laptop hybrid IMO.


Honestly that would be perfect for me. I have 2018 iPad Pro and an M1 MacBook Air, 
If i could run things like rstudio on the iPad (and ideally plug in my UW monitor via thunderbolt) I’d replace them both. 

Seems wasteful to have both at this point. 

I’m looking forward to WWDC.


iPad Pro is relatively new and iPadOS has to support the lower end iPads as well.

I truly do think tablets are the future of computing. Most of my family prefers to use tablets for their everyday computing. We do have laptops because the iPad software isn't good enough to do heavy lifting, but I'm hoping Apple keeps expanding it until it's as efficient as MacOS.


> Honestly we are getting to the point that the hardware is outdoing what the software can provide.

That's been the case for quite a while


>fusion of iPadOS and macOS

Yeah, a desktop-like environment like Samsung's DeX on their highend phones and tablets would be nice on the iPad


The macbook air will never die. Apple tried. Really they put a lot of effort into making a successor. The name is just so powerful that the discontinued and mega outdated Macbook Air kept selling in huge numbers at third party retailers. So Apple brought it back. It isn't dying again.


its odd we didn't get an update or iPadOS so I think its coming


We’re not even close to the power we are going to need when AR is fully released.


>Honestly we are getting to the point that the hardware is outdoing what the software can provide.

We've passed that point at least 3 years ago.


Would be an instant buy if I could do any serious programming on it


Apple spends tons of money to try to convince me to use the iPad as a workstation, but specifically won't let the iPad be a workstation and run macos, even when it's using the same processor as their damn MacBooks.  

It's a joke.


Hopefully it will run a new version of OSX this fall to make it a real Surface competitor.


Exactly this. Unless ipad os15 massively pushes ipad’s capability, then what’s the point of giving us all this power


I honestly couldn't recommend an M1 iPad Pro over a new M1 MacBook Air if the person could only afford one of the other. The iPad Air is so much more capable because it runs MacOS. It can run iPad, iOS and MacOS apps - M1 iPad Pro simply can't compete, Apple has limited it.


Tim in disguise caught me off guard


[removed]


Exactly. I'm a little tired of my iPad just being a larger version of my iPhone lol. I get iPadOS, but I want something that is more distinguishable.


It has thunderbolt 3, which is basically USB 4.


It doesn’t need to run macOS. That’s an impatient strategy. 

iPad OS needs to be about 3 years ahead of where it is


The camera works the same whether portrait or landscape, don't see the issue with the position.


This! Fix This!  
My Surface Pro camera is perfectly placed.

99% of the time, I use my ipad pro in landscape mode. All accessories (covers/keyboards) show it in landscape mode. 100% of the time I use the camera the ipad is in landscape orientation.

Centerstage and eye contact is just fancy software trying to address an easy hardware issue.  


Not replacing my ipad as long as the camera stays put. Absolute insanity.


https://apple.com/feedback


>	Make it a landscape device already what the hell?

This should’ve happened since the first ever iPad Pro with keyboard, instead they stick with sideways Apple logo (which later gets “fixed” by covering it up with the new cases) and offside FaceTime camera.


Same! The price for the 16GB version is hard to swallow but I finally will have the memory I’ve been needing!


Yea I'm holding back my criticism until WWDC.


This was exactly the line that plagued reviews for the 2018 iPad Pro refresh. 

WWDCs gonna be epic.


Because they *definitely* need to pad those.


It's not even the price bump. I don't want the giant iPad that's 50% heavier. But man I really wanted the new screen tech. Now I'm trying to decide on 11" with no new screen or wait another year and hope they don't keep that exclusive to the giant model.


Given the Switch has to run the game at a dynamic 648p max. (https://youtu.be/2oxci-dTujo), it’s probably fair to say this iPad might be the first time you can actually play this game on a mobile device at HD or better.


About to say, nobody actually does professional editing on a tablet. It doesn't even compare to a desktop experience.


16gb of ram on that thin thing packed with M1 is nuts. All that’s missing is a full fledged OS. Then that will be the definitive device to have


I think that maybe the Pro models will come to possibility to run MacOS otherwise it’s a bit difficult since there are lower end IPads too and they are not going to split the iPad OS in two different branches.


So you get both.


The only thing iPadOS is good for 🍻


That shit was way to uncanny valley for me.


Big [Camera Turning Into George Lucas](https://twitter.com/Papapishu/status/996255370451587072) vibes


The apple equivalent to “I’am your father, Luke.”


Thunderbolt four, actually


I wonder if that means they’re planning on proper external monitor support


The iPad Pro probably accounts for a miniscule of that revenue cut. The revenue from the App Store is coming from the iPhone and cheaper iPads, not the $1k+ iPad Pros.


The M1 chip isn't anything special compared to previous A#X chips. Just newer and more powerful but fundamentally very similar. I would expect the A12X and A12Z iPPs to run ''''iPadOS Pro'''' just fine and the A10X, A12 models may be able to as well.


I think people should set expectations. Apple has a 2-3 year lead time on hardware at times. For example, the U1 chip came in the 11 nearly two years ago and wasn’t used for anything “real” until next month. 

They will announce a lot of stuff that makes use of these crazy specs but I wouldn’t be surprised to see development SDKs (eg xcode) and things like Final Cut until next year with this year focused more on the Home Screen.


Guessing the iMac doesn't have the wide angle lens? Centre Stage is less useful with a narrower FOV.


You can always sell it. You won’t make back all of what you spent, but you should be able to get a decent chunk of change for it.

Feel free to prove me wrong but I’m pretty sure that most people that have computers with touch screens that aren’t convertible don’t use touch at all.

At least that’s my impression based on people that I know that have a Windows laptop with touch.


It seems like a real miss for kids.  Most of the early education apps are touch driven.  Instead of selling me a $1500 iMac they get a $300 iPad.


lmao thats what i've been telling people. the macbook air and ipad pro should just combine into a 2 in 1 laptop.


Yeah 128GB Wi-Fi only. 

Honestly expected it to be more expensive.


“up to 50% faster than the 2020 iPad Pro.”


Geekbench 1100 vs 1700 ; 4500 vs 7xxx for single/multi


I want to know how it affects battery life. My M1 MBP lasts an absurd amount of time.


Up to 16 GB of RAM, they have finally listed it for the first time


It said "up to 16 GB RAM" in the last slide.


8GB on 128, 256, 512GB storage options

16GB on 1TB and 2TB.

Same structure for both 11 inch and 12.9 inch


The last slide up to 16 gb. I’m hoping the 12.9 is 16.


what would you do with that much RAM though? It's not like you can really do anything with it on iPadOS.

Actually, what's that M1 chip for if all you get is iPadOS?

*Just let me run virtual machines ffs*

I agree that WWDC is incredibly important for this iPad Pro. But I think if they try to also cater for the older generation iPad Pros, even just last generation, it will be a disappointment and will mean this new iPad is held back by even more. I'd rather they went all out on M1 only features tbh :/


I sure hope so.


M1 makes no difference for cloud streaming games. 

Also, never gonna happen as an official app. Safari only


Even full resolution on an external display would make iPadOS slightly more palatable.


It’s because 5G is really expensive to incorporate in a device. In a lighter note, if you’re in the US, carriers are offering a $200 discount for a 5G-activated iPad Pro.


Yes.  The new iPad Pros still have ‘ProMotion’ 120 Hz screens, including the 12.9" model’s ‘XDR’ HDR miniLED display.


What’s a computer?


My 10.5" performs like brand new. You're either full of shit or you treat your device like shit


Really? I’m using a 9.7” iPad Pro from 2016, so it’ll be 5 years old this year and I can’t say I’ve noticed any performance dips - maybe a *little* here and there but definitely no crashes or anything.


With those issues after 3 years, you may want to reconsider even buying another iPad. That sounds awful


*cries in iPad 5th Gen*

I’ll gladly take the Pro off your hands.


100% - as a Photographer, Filmmaker and sometimes music editor, virtually all ubiquitous desktop editing programs are nowhere to be found on iPadOS. And even ones that are like Lightroom or Ps are a joke and for the most part completely useless for someone who is a Pro and doing it for a living.

The fact Apple doesn't even have versions of FCPX, Motion, Xcode, Logic, Compressor for iPadOS shows even they don't think it's a Pro machine.

I just don't see any reason to be hyped over an M1 iPad if you have the already over powered 2017/2020 version.

That's not even getting into the single single thunderbolt port. Really couldn't give us huh Apple?


WWDC is in. A little over a month…
Chill


$2400 for a 2 TB 12.9” iPad Pro with cellular data.


A lot


That would actually make this device make sense, but they didn't do it so...


I suspect soon we will have an announcement of universal apps so any MacOS app that supports M1 will work on iPad Pro as well.


Yes


eh, not really. for some, they could go one or the other. For some, one is better than the other. For the rest, they could utilize both. 

I'd say the iPad (and the direction it's going) and MBP have some overlaps with very distinct differences, which make them unique and not fully replaceable.


Maybe because Microsoft killed the competition with the Surface already


the XDR screen probably eats into that


1 and 2 TB


I search so you don't have to.  It's actually just an IKEA desk:

https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/anfallare-mittback-desk-bamboo-birch-s49417728/


2019 is still plenty fast because 2020 was sorta incremental. Maybe new features at WWDC will make a more compelling case for all that power


MacOS.


Macbook air is a cheaper much more complete package.

Mac mini is a desktop. And again, cheaper.


Os


Just the iPad, big miss on this!


That’s microLED. This is a half step, but still a solid step.


I want an M1 for my Apple Watch 

And my Apple Pencil


For now at least


That makes a ton of sense, actually.


Already lost the right ass cheek?


A14 has 6 CPU cores (2 big 4 little), 4 GPU cores
M1 has 8 CPU cores (4 big 4 little), 7-8 GPU cores (based on config)

M1 also has a wider memory bus. Clocks are usually lower on the phones too.


M-series is A-series on steroids


M1 super fast Mac version fast fast fast faster


One is a low power desktop class ARM processor without active cooling, one is a higher power mobile class ARM processor.

The M1 uses much newer ARM cores from their 2021 Firestorm / Icestorm Architecture, and has 24 cores total including the Neural Engine


[deleted]


Isn’t WWDC in june??


This is what keeps me from buying such a device. I have a 2018 'regular' iPad and a MacBook Pro. In terms of function the regular iPad still works great, as I don't do any real sort of work on it. As soon as I need more power, a proper keyboard or multitasking windows I go to my MacBook and I don't see that changing with just having a beefier iPad. If it were to run more similar to macOS I'd be happy to retire my MacBook Pro.


I think it will just be iPad OS like how it looks now but beefed up to do everything the mac does, so the app store will hopefully have new guidelines that allow Mac size apps and the iPad OS itself will have Mac features like dual screen and such.


I keep wanting to upgrade my "aging" 2017 iPad Pro but there's just never a reason for me to do such, and I'll be waiting yet another year to see if anything changes.

I consider myself somewhat of a "power iPad" user. I use it as a portable DAW for music production, I use it for photo editing, I use Logic Remote so I can treat it as a control surface for Logic, I play non-trivial games on it like Civ VI and it still chugs through perfectly fine.

Every once in awhile I find the amount of RAM to be a little limiting, but it's certainly not limited by power no matter what I throw at it, so any newer iPad Pro will just be, as you guys said, power wasted.


Yeah I don't know what they have planned but its big. iPad pros currently run at 4-6GB of RAM. They've never more than double the amount of RAM available on an iPad. WWDC is going to be big.


Just for others who come here and are wondering:

 

* 8GB RAM on models with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage
* 16GB RAM on models with 1TB or 2TB storage


Yeah that memory blurb had me double taking. That is definitely a signal of intent of some kind. IDK what.


Nah, still think that’s a pipe dream for now. I bet we can expect heavier programs like Logic and Final Cut though; lots of rumors last year about plans for em (for this year around this time)


They’re clearly sidestepping macOS support with universal apps and an M1 iPad Pro along with the Magic Keyboard, mouse support, et cetera already available; I expect we’ll see a big push at WWDC for Mac app developers to add iPad Pro support & possibly some sort of rules/category addition to allow them to do so without optimizing for a touch-based interface at all.


WWDC is right around the corner.


Yes I think that's fair. But also to note as an iPad user we have been waiting for the big iPadOS announcement 'this year' for like 3 years now.


You'd hope so. But we all know we'll get new emojis instead.


Logic and Final Cut universal Apps.


The writing is on the wall for that. iPadOS 15 is very likely going to be a game changer for the platform.


[deleted]


At this point it’s kind of absurd that it **can’t** do this.  They didn’t show the home screen during the presentation, so I was really hoping they would have something to say about the software at the end.


It would kill Macbook sales so fast you'd be shocked that it was a product they sold. I'm confident the only thing that would make Apple put OSX on the iPad is a serious Android/Windows competitor that threatens it's market share. That *could* be Samsung or Microsoft eventually, but they're both (at best) 3-4 years away from something like that assuming they went all in.

So long as Apple can sell you a Macbook Air *and* an iPad, they'll do that.


Really disagree here. I don't think the answer is to move macOS to the iPad. Expand iPadOS with more functionality.


I’ve been waiting to upgrade solely just for having more layers in procreate because I do a lot of photobashing. I’ll still wait to see to make sure that the new RAM will actually allow for more layers, but I’m definitely on board as well.


Yeah a lot of people who clearly don’t use an iPad for content creation are posting about how the OS would waste the RAM and I’m like, there are plenty of apps TODAY that would benefit greatly from an M1 with more RAM. 

People have such a hard time looking outside the spectrum of their own experiences.


My Air 4 has a A14, and I find it to be super fast for everything. Most web pages seem to render faster on the iPad than on my 16" MBP :-(


Are you running low on storage


Lags how? That doesn't sound normal


It all boils down to the App Store revenue... if you allow people to install software freely, you give up some of that revenue.

It really sucks that they care more about money than allowing the user to use the device however they want.


Absolutely. If I could do iOS development on my iPad Pro I’d be buying the latest modell on day 1.


Give me a docking station with multiple monitor support and I’ll never buy a MacBook again

That last point is why I see Apple hesitating to do this


That’s assuming Apple provides any virtualization support, which given their stance on even emulating games I highly doubt


I think what they need is give you the ability to switch between ipadOS and MacOS on the ipad pros.  Non ipad pros just run ipadOS but the pro machines can toggle between the two.  That would be ideal.  When I'm just chilling on the couch or want to watch tv in bed I turn on ipadOS mode and when I need to get real work done I turn on MacOS mode.


Something like Samsung DeX comes to mind.

Give a full desktop experience when docked, and switch to a tablet experience when on the go.

But that would also require Apple to actually let you install software not from the App Store to make it possible. (most apps on macOS aren't on the store)


There’s nothing to port though, the iPad Pro is the same hardware as the M1 computers 

The only difference is they presumably lock down the boot-loader on the iPad so it can only boot iOS 

That’s the really annoying part... the only thing preventing macOS and other systems from running on the iPad Pro is Apple, it’s not even the hardware anymore


>I think they're always gonna reserve the best screens for their XDR display and Ipads

I really don't understand why that should be the case. The bigger MacBook Pro in many configurations passes $3k or even $4k mark. Why would you not put there a feature that's present on a device for less than half the price?


Right, but how long until the macbook pro gets an xdr display is the point


Almost certainly the same.


Probably with just slight tweaks

Did anyone spot the white magic keyboard? It was shown for a split second

Edit: yeah minutes later they announced it


It is likely the same chip (as making even small tweaks in silicon is very expensive), they probably just disable the Mac specific stuff.


>I sense an eventual merger of MacOS and iOS within this decade. That's the direction they're going: several devices, one chip, one flexible OS.

I understand this is a gradual process, but someone has said this every year for such a long, long time. Maybe beginning with the debut of the first iPad Pro? The iPad has been such a powerful device hampered by an OS built for a phone.


This has to be what they’re doing; it seems dead obvious that they’re eventually going to do this just given the direction of their hardware investments with the iPad, the redesign of MacOS, apple silicon being able to run iOS apps, etc.


Yep, it’ll all just be AppleOS with a different UI for each device family.


Docked with a keyboard and Mac gives you MacOS - handheld gives you iPadOS. I’d buy it in a heartbeat.


if Apple found a compelling way to do what Microsoft tried to do (and failed) with the Surface, it’d literally be the last device I’d buy


All of those OS' you just mentioned already share lots of code (or, I assume they do. I don't work at Apple). The branding doesn't matter if all of the devices share a similar architecture (M/A-series) and codebase. 

So to answer your question directly - Yes, they could all end up running the same OS someday. Just different versions with different extensions tailored to each type of device.


or they simply are increasing the mental gymnastics you have to do over specs so they can upsell the 12 inch iPad Pro. Not new for Apple and any other company it's just that Apple can market it well to get people buying.


They need to split iPadOS and Pro OS. Want a tablet? Get the cheap one. Want a pro machine? Get the pro. This thing runs M1, limiting it with software is dumb. They’d get so many new buyers


OS updates are announced at WWDC, not hardware events. So hopefully some changes will be announced in June!


Well, you could use ***5G (tm)*** to remote into an actual desktop OS and do it there, but that's kind of cheating I suppose.


I think an iPad version of XCode is basically guaranteed for WWDC now.


It really feels like at this point XCode for iPad has to be coming.


Same same same! Don't even want to do serious programing, just web dev! I was so excited for them to say something like "and now it runs MacOS" but instead they were like "it plays games too!" Come on!


If I could have an iPad Pro that runs Logic Pro one day, I'd upgrade from the iPad Air so fast...


How cool would it be to be able to run the apps you're developing on an iPad? No more carrying around a cable to run your builds on a physical device.


My mom uses a 2018 iPad Pro as a very large iPhone because she has bad eyesight.


Keep dreaming, buddy.


“Mac” could just be an app on this iPad. All we need is enough memory.   That has to be where they’re heading with this as they continue to blur the lines between Mac and iPad hardware.


One of the biggest thing holding the iPad back is iPadOS not being entirely MacOS, hopefully they can address it soon enough.


Well I can’t draw on a Mac. This is the best news for art lovers everywhere.


I thought it was going to be Craig!


That was quite funny lol


Yeah that was really cool


I thought it was Andy Dick at first lol


Because $$$


Because it isn't WWDC yet. If I'm wrong and no OS change happens at WWDC, that would make me very sad. But I have high expectations for this year.


You can fit more items on the dock lol


I have an 11” iPad Pro right now and the most annoying thing about video calls is the camera location.


The camera position sucks. It’s my biggest problem with my iPad Pro. Constantly covered when I’m trying to unlock it because I grip the iPad on the side. Awkward positioning during FaceTime calls.

No one I know uses an iPad in portrait orientation more than like 15% of the time. Especially a Pro that usually has a case/keyboard. I’m not buying another one until they move the damn camera.


Your face won’t be centered when you have it in landscape.


For me going from 4GB to 8GB will be incredible.


I really hope so. It feels like we’ve been saying that the iPad’s full potential will be unlocked with the next update for a few years now.


I totally agree! My fingers/wrist get fatigued holding the 11” for extended periods and I can’t even imagine trying to wield the 12.9” as a tablet. I’ll be sticking with my 2018 11” iPad Pro for another year.


It would be nice to see larger developers release other console titles on iPad following this. I would imagine there are plenty of people willing to play big AAA games on these devices.


The price difference does not justify getting both, even for luxury needs especially since the iPad Pro's RAM will probably be lower than the base M1 Macbook


I thought they said USB4, not thunderbolt 4.


The shot with a Pro Display XDR showed the work the woman was editing appearing in what looked like the full 6K resolution on the XDR, from the iPad.


Yes, but there’s no reason it *couldn’t* have had that - they already were putting in an “all new camera”, so why not choose one that supports the new feature? Why do they insist on making the desktop computers’ FaceTime experience lag so far behind their mobile devices?


I know but it feels like they are missing out on users who want something like a surface pro


That really doesn’t help them. Most people would just get a MacBook Air then. Most people do not need both. They may want both but they don’t need them both


> The reason they won’t is so you’re stuck buying a Mac and an iPad.

The fact that the Macbook Pro runs iPad and iPhone apps would seem to counter that thought.


>what would you do with that much RAM though? It's not like you can really do anything with it on iPadOS.

I'm an artist who works almost entirely on my iPad Pro. Canvas size limitations and layer limitations caused by RAM are the bane of my existence.


No but spending 1.5k on a 2020 Pro vs 1.6k on a 2021 Pro is a marked difference for the product vs ~$100


She/he either got a bad one, trashed it, or exaggerating to justify the purchase. My mother has an iPad Pro 10.5 & has used it daily since purchase to watch stupid facebook videos and other boomer stuff and it's still completely usable. They were known for some screen white spot issues but them being crippled after 3 years is strange. 

Unless they're editing 4k HDR footage all the time I can't imagine what the bottleneck on iPadOS would be.


The 5th gen was def a bit of an oof year. The 6th gen boosted performance so much. You should consider upgrading to the 8th gen.


Lol... that’s new compared to my dinosaur. 😂 iPad 2nd gen.. it’s basically a paperweight. 5 minutes or more just to get something to play in Spotify. Forget most other apps. I’ll take your 5 any day over mine. A pro is the dream if they actually make use of the power it’s got..


Sold! My old iPad is probably 10 years old, can’t even update some apps on it anymore.


They didn’t do it because they don’t announce new software until June 7..


imagine connecting a 6k display via thunderbolt off of your apple watch


An M1 Apple Pencil no longer needs the user as you would only slow it down.


M1X for my Airtags when?


Can I get my old iPod upgraded to an M1 chip?


And M1 has a thunderbolt controller.


Is there any difference between the M1 in the Macbook Air, iMac, and iPad Pro? It seems weird to me that they iMac wouldn't be more powerful.


> One is a low power desktop class ARM processor without active cooling, one is a higher power mobile class ARM processor.

It's just a reconfiguration of the same cores. They swap two little cores for big cores and (iirc) bump the clocks up slightly to make the more-powerful M1 (which is essentially a rebranded AX line chip).

>and has 24 cores total including the Neural Engine

That's a somewhat misleading way to explain the M1


Yes, but the actual public release (where these devices get shipped with it) always comes out in September

You can do the beta releases after WWDC


UI needs windowed apps to be effective as a desktop.  At that point, might as well leverage the macOS UI.


Right there with you! Love the new design and FaceID, but spec-for-spec, the 2020 iPad Pro wasn't much of an upgrade. Could go for the Air 4, of course, but that's too much for me to drop just for the new form factor.


Right there with you. Would easily pick up this new iPad Pro if I could use Ableton on it.


Alternatively, my 2016 iPad Pro 9.7” has been struggling more and more to keep up with art & design apps. Probably memory limitations are the main problem rather than being a prImarily CPU-based bottleneck, but trying to work on higher-resolution files *or* more-complex files with more than a few layers quickly reaches a point where even the Apple Pencil lags into unusability. I’ve tried with multiple apps, and in general find that it seems to be hardware-limited within up-to-date apps. For simple stuff like mobile-style games, web browsing, videos, et cetera I expect it’ll keep chugging along for many more years, but I’ve definitely passed the point where I’ve had to delay a number of art projects until these new iPads Pro were released. (A new iPad Pro being much more affordable for this kind of work than, say, a Cintiq & new Mac.)


IPad is one of the few tech devices these days that I run into the ground. I upgraded to an iPad pro last year, from a gen 1 iPad air.... 

That being said I would REALLY like to be able to use final cut on my iPad, I'm no fc power user, but I like the color grading and transitions it allows for my family videos


Love my 2017... Wish I had gotten more storage but as it stands I have no intention to replace it.


Same here. Been power-using my iPad 10.5 2017 for a while, I see no reason to upgrade other than "shiny new thing I want."


The iPad anymore just feels like putting a Ferrari engine on a go-kart.  

It's got the power. They just keep putting in more power. They aren't doing what's necessary to let us use it.


I hope they bring a more versatile OS to it. I’d love to have Xcode running on an iPad. Now there is no reason why they can’t.

Please, Apple, please!


This is my feeling - no need for 16GB of RAM unless they are planning a massive software overhaul for iPad Pro.


Maybe it has 8-16GB of RAM because that’s what all the other M1 machines have. Keeps the complexity down for the whole lineup.


Apple seem to future proof their hardware way ahead of time. Didn’t all the necessary chips for AirTags and Spatial Audio start shipping way before the software (and additional hardware) was available? This 16gb ram could be for something at WWDC, but equally it could be for something they’re planning 2 years from now.


It’s the next step to transition into a merged iPadOS and macOS.


it's far less of a pipe dream now. hardware from SoC to I/O is now unified between mac and ipad.


This seems like the most obvious scenario, they will keep each OS separate but allow the iPad to essentially run macOS apps, or as you said at least allow/encourage developers to bring their macOS apps to iPad.


.


WWDC will be interesting for sure.


Imagine running Parallels with Windows 10 for ARM on an M1 iPad Pro.


"iMac has an M1 which means it can run all your favorite iPhone and iPad apps"

"iPad has an M1 which means it can't run your iMac apps"


It would burn mac sales to the ground. Obviously it would be very simple to do with the M1 chip, there's essentially no hardware difference between an iPad pro and a macbook at this point, but then who would buy a mac?


This. I abandoned Apple cause the Pixel Slate line has the whole dual OS feature and included a container for me to develop on and use as a real computer when I needed but able to disconnect and use as a hand held for entertainment. Now that Google killed that I'm looking back at an iPad and had high hopes of at least being able to open a Linux contianer on the iPad I mean for goodness sakes it's now the same chip in all devices and it should have the ability to be able to, but I have doubts Apple is going to do this for mobile OS for another 5 years just cause.


Software changes of that magnitud seems more likely to get announced at WWDC than during a hardware focused product announcement. Developers would need time to modify their apps for use on a touchscreen


[deleted]


...that's why they kept music off of iPhones initially, to keep selling people iPods *and* iPhones, eh?


Exactly and thats the same for all manufacturers.  You could run a chromeos or even windows on a highend samsung device


> It would kill Macbook sales so fast you'd be shocked that it was a product they sold

I miss the Apple that gave zero fucks about cannibalizing their own products. Maybe if an iPad can do the job better than a MacBok, then the MacBook should go away.


It might eat into some Air/13" Pro sales, but I would think the high end Pro would be safe. 

Maybe they could have the lineup be:

- iPad Pro 12.9" (with MacOS support)
- MacBook Air
- MacBook Pro (16")

Or just say fuck it and just have the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. Hell, the iPad Air could replace the MacBook Air.


Honestly, I don't think it would be a bad thing if they killed off the MacBook entirely and just added the functionality to iPad Pro

a singular device that can act as a tablet *or* computer.

Have a keyboard dock with extended battery and a trackpad and just have it switch into macOS when docked.

It would also sell more higher capacity devices which would mean more profit for Apple.

They could still have the "regular" iPad as the tablet only device, but have the iPad Pro as a much more powerful device.


Apple has already shown they'll kill the cashcow to move towards the future, like they did with the iPod/iPhone.


Personally , I’m the kind of person who goes for the highest storage capacity just to feel good about myself.  
 
The only devices I maxed out the storages on were my 128GB iPad Air 2 and 128GB iPhone 6s. This iPad I’m using still has 332GB free but it runs like an android phone from 2008


>It really sucks that they care more about money than allowing the user to use the device however they want.

Sorry, but it's silly to think they wouldn't.

Please read the CEO's inevitable memoir "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" to learn more.


The iPad also costs a lot more than the comparable laptop though.

The iPad Pro would become the "pro" device and the laptop would just be the more limited device.

You'd still have people buying the macs because of the price, but you'd also have people buy iPad Pros for the additional features.


Yes exactly, that would be the ideal 2 in 1 device. But if the MacOS runs virtualized as an app with little overhead performance lost, then it would make it much more straightforward to switch between environments.


Yes but you never had the same chip before


“Within this decade”


It's a gradual thing. Mac OS now has finger sized on screen conrols for volume and brightness for example. don't do that for shits and giggles


Every year they’re getting closer and closer. Apple silicon was a huge leap toward this goal.


This is precisely what I was thinking, and that's honestly the most likely name they'd choose. By the '30s, we'll just have a variety of Apple devices with AppleOS and Apple Silicon, and the UI will depend on the device. Call me crazy, but I think this level of integration is what Steve dreamt of.


iPad Switch


Or at least give us something similar to Samsung Dex


i'd sell my soul for a macOS tablet that worked like how Windows RT was supposed to work like


Both things are true at the same time here.


The issue is they want you to buy an ipad pro AND a macbook pro.  So if the ipad basically replaced the macbook pro then overall sales will decline.  And seeing that no competitor on the market can even match the power or usability of the iPads apple has no reason to put MacOS on the ipad pros.  Honestly the pricing for the new pro is insane.  Way overpriced for what it can do.  The 1 ltb pro with cellular is $2k like are you fucking kidding me?  Doesn't even include the pencil and key board accessories.  I can buy the M1 macbooks pro for way less and that has a built in keyboard at least.


I do that already but I want XCode on the damn thing. It can run it, it has the power to be faster then i7 MacBooks, is all on Apple now. I won’t buy another iPad Pro (or iPad at all) until they do it right. My 2018 runs well enough, if they announce a better OS with real Pro apps, I’ll buy it in an instant.


That's pretty much all I use mine for as well. It's a shame, because the hardware is capable of much more.


If they were serious about this, she'd still be able to do that. These things should be dual booting iOS and macOS.  The only thing not allowing it at this point is Apple choosing to not do it.


Why not at this point though?

Attach a keyboard with trackpad and it’s virtually the same form factor.

It’s not like it’s aching for power


It was hidden on one of the feature screens but the new iPad Pro comes with “up to 16gb of memory.”


I think they're really trying to make the iPad a single device without the need for a mouse or a keyboard, but it's been years and it's becoming clearer and clearer that  a poweruser (AKA. the "pro"-crowd) will never get used to 'touch'. On the other hand, the Macbooks are all incredibly comfortable to be a power-user on, and to type on the lap with, but for more casual use such as lying on the sofa, it's suddenly way harder. I think Apple is on a limbo with what to do with Macbooks and iPads. Obviously iMacs are the stationary Apple devices, iPhones are the phones to fit the pocket, and Macbooks and iPads.. err. In the future, I believe that Apple will fully integrate mac os to the iPad and completely remove the low entry Macbooks.


Or take handwritten notes.


Do you really need that power for drawing though? I get the display but the processing power is kinda overkill.


I thought it would be the CEO of Xiaomi stealing the M1.


Same


I thought it would be Tom Cruise


I hope you're right. It pains me to see that kind of hardware held back by iPadOS.


The new iPads specifically have a feature to put you in the center. It's called Center Stage.

I got one of the ones with the white spots. I sent it back and they replaced it with one that had even more white spots. I ended up having to get the first one back because they wouldn't let me trade anymore. A-holes. Apart from that, it works great. I've had absolutely no issues with it, and it gets used heavily every day.


Yeah, I’m sold too. Already apologized in advance to my wallet (and wife).


And my Airtags

You need time for developers to buy them and think about what they’d do if they had macOS on them. Then you need to make sure the supply is enough for the developers that don’t. Then you announce the software changes and release the beta so they can develop for the new software. Then you release the software.

This isn’t that wild of a cycle. The only time I’ve ever seen them release a major new OS and update an existing product at the same time was the Apple TV 3 and it was only available to developers.

Similarly, the m1 macs were dev only, but there wasn’t a new OS. Watch, iPhone and iPad were all new platforms so they had to do both at the same time.


Basically the only thing I really want is tap to wake. I have an iPhone 11 and I'm always using tap to wake, I can't count how many times I've tried to use it on my old iPad Pro.


I would squeal with happy noises for days if I could use full blown Logic Pro X on it. Logic Remote is good for a control surface and there are a few decent DAWs available, but I do a lot of recording on the fly on the go and I would just absolutely love being able to do it all from an iPad. I could see some really awesome editing features using gestures and such.

Ableton would probably convince me to buy as well, It's not my go-to, but I doink around in it and it's super fun.


Comment has been removed because Spez killed Reddit :(


Sounds like a great reason to upgrade! If I'm being honest, I kinda secretly wish mine was choppy and unusable just because I'm a tech nerd and want to justify a new iPad, but I just can't do it right now.


[deleted]


Could be, but if theres no real use for the RAM it seems like a waste. But then again you could be right. It might be cheaper to make only one chip and waste that RAM than to make two chips with different RAM amounts.

But theres also the fact that they could’ve left it at the base 8GB config and the fact that they mentioned “up to 16GB” makes me think something is up.


there’s no reason now why the iPad Pro cant be a Mac Mini and a 13” MacBook Air now.


People keep saying this year after year so I'm skeptical it's gonna be that. Apple had so much time to do it and they've been avoiding it for some reason.


The iPhone burned the iPod market to the ground, but you don’t see Apple shedding any tears over the result.


Bigger screen and having the keyboard attached without an extra accessory are big selling points for a lot of people.


> but then who would buy a mac?

The docked tablet form factor isn't quite as much of a laptop as an actual laptop. I think plenty of people would still opt for a MacBook in that situation.


>	but then who would buy a mac?

People that prefer a laptop. For example, there’s *a lot* of people that prefer the surface laptop over the surface pro.


Yes and no IMO. Even if they permit running MacOS apps on the iPad, specs wise, there are fundamental differences between iPad Pro and MacBooks to force users into one of the two form factors.

Regardless, top level iPad Pro is about the same price of a mid spec MacBook Pro, so what is there to loose?


Nobody cares about self cannibalization as long as it doesn't come with customer confusion.


Yep, look at the pricing for the high end iPad Pro - it's in M1 Mac Book Pro territory.  If they can sell you something as expensive or more expensive, and sell it to more people, they might do it.


That was 14 years ago, under Steve Jobs and not "King of Min/Max" Tim Cook. Everything about Apple in recent years has been about maximizing profit and unifying their supply chain. If they can sell 1 person, 2 devices, using the same base hardware and R&D, I think that's the path they'd take over a less profitable all-in-one.


No other manufacturer other than Microsoft can really leverage this though. Sure you could sell a Galaxy Tab with Windows 10X, but right now the Windows tablet ecosystem is actual garbage.

OSX w/ iOS support would be uniquely positioned to take over a whole market segment, at the expense of the Macbook.


I agree, I love my Galaxy Tab S7 and I could honestly see myself getting a Surface if I needed a Windows Laptop in the future. The whole form factor has a lot of pros, and the Magic Keyboard turns the iPad Pro into a really compelling laptop alternative.

Except for iOS. iOS is the thing that holds it all back.

Maybe one day, but I think Apple is too busy wringing people dry buying both atm. I hope I'm wrong though.


So Microsoft Surface Book, except not shit? Yes please.


I’m not sure if the battery could affect the performance on ipad like it does on iphone. See if your battery health is low too (you can check that with coconut battery on a mac)


Oh, they’ve actively worked to prevent sideloading with Xcode... before I wrote the app signer tool you could install as many apps as you wanted and they’d last for 90 days


Has that really mattered? A lot of the things that people are complaining about aren't bound by the chip.

* Better window management
* Better file management
* More RAM and a less aggressive task manager so things aren't killed randomly
* Better display support
* Better external input support

Really, just make the *UI* closer to OSX, and that's not really a SoC dependant thing.


Right but it's the same OS from yesterday.


That’s why, the price overlaps now. Give it M1 but a shitty OS, I’ll buy a MacBook. Improve the OS I’ll buy the 2TB model AND a magic keyboard.


[deleted]


Yeah the store just updated and the 1TB and higher models get 16GB of RAM.  We are absolutely going to get MacOS on this in some form.


> but it's been years and it's becoming clearer and clearer that a poweruser (AKA. the "pro"-crowd) will never get used to 'touch'

It's not about getting used to it, it's just fundamentally a less precise method of interaction (unless you're doing something like digital art)


same


They stole the presentation already.


My face being centered was never the issue with my ipad pro 2020. The issue is eyelines. When I look at someone's face on my iPad in landscape mode, I naturally look at the top-center of the iPad. As a result of the camera being on the side in landscape, it always looks like I'm looking off to the side, rather than looking at the person I'm talking to. 

I really hoped they would fix the eyeline problem - I don't see center stage making a big difference.


I also want to apologize to our wife


and my iAxe


inb4 Airtag pros


That makes sense. Thanks.


I surprised how quickly my habits developed around this feature. When I need to go back to my work phone and it doesn’t have that feature I’m legit confused for a second or two.

Face-ID is another feature I can’t live without either. Good lord, it’s so clutch.


OTOH why wouldn’t a developer port their M1 Mac app to the M1 iPad Pro? It finally has enough RAM now and USB-C. The underlying dev APIs are basically the same, they just need to optimize the UI for touch vs mouse, which Apple had tools for with Catalyst. We’ll have to see what Apple does at WWDC to build on that technology.


Yeah but can my Mac mini be an IPad?????


They've been scared of doing it too quickly, like Microsoft tried to do with Windows 8. They ripped the bandaid off and just tried to get to merging the OSes right away. I feel Apple is taking the opposite approach and being maybe a little too cautious.


[deleted]


Well IPhones cost more than IPods and iPod touches so that makes sense. MacBooks are typically a lot more expensive depending on the config


I’d rather have a laptop than an iPad w accessories


[deleted]


Exactly. The money ends up in the same place eventually, and the customers are better catered for and happier as a result. 

I have no interest in either a new MacBook Pro or an iPad Pro. But I’d be a day one purchaser of this for sure.


[deleted]


This exactly what I’d say apple is planning on doing.


Yeah, they also have WWDC in a little over a month which is where they announce new software.


My guess is adding MacOS to the iPad gives users a reason not to buy a macbook or whatever fully fledged device apple currently offers. It might diminish the "owns both ipad and MacOS device" audience


I think apps will be more cross platform compatible, but the so will stay separate so iPadOS is the touchscreen OS while macOS stays for keyboard and mouse. Hopefully they just add a real file system to iPadOS.


Because macOS is not optimized for touch. At all. And this is still a device that prioritizes touch input.

Using macOS on the iPad would make the Magic Keyboard or other input devices a requirement, and in my opinion a mistake.


I have a feeling the closest we will get, is apps that have been designed for both. Just like they talked about how you can handoff apps to the new iMac, because it can run iPhone / iPad apps. Eventually all apps will be able to run across all devices seamlessly


They have the maintain eye contact feature for FaceTime.

Linus Tech Tips did a test with the M1 MBA and MBP, but removing the insulation from the CPU of the MBA and adding thermal patches instead and basically turning the bottom of the MBA into a heat sink and the MBA had better sustained performance over the MBP because the MBP needed to spin up fans and performance dipped until the fans brought temps back down. 

The downside is that the bottom got very hot.


I know the configuration vary a lot for the MacBook, but for the new iPad Pro is generally priced about $100 less than the M1 MacBook Pro. If you throw on a Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil, the iPad Pro is a few hundred more than the current MacBook Pro with the same size screen. With the inclusion of Thunderbolt, Apple could also make a pretty compelling dock with an additional monitor that could also charge users for.


Have to disagree with that. Heck, the iPad Pro 12.9 starts at 1099$ with 128 GB of storage and the MacBook Air starts at 999$ with 256 GB of storage. Only the 11’’ with 256 GB could undercut or match the MacBook Air with it’s price. So profit shouldn’t be a problem here. And if they are really worried about profit, only let the iPad Pros run macOS and no other iPads.


Id rather have a Mac with Apple Pencil input


This.  Different people want different things.  Many people would still want a Macbook, but I do think an iPad Pro would eventually come to supplant it.  But does Apple really want Microsoft completely taking over that tablet/PC hybrid space?  I have a Surface for work, and I never use it as a tablet, but the instant on and the super thin form factor is amazing.


Yeah, I was kind of indirectly the reason they limited the free accounts

The day I heard of the free program I knew you’d be able to install apps using it because it was already possible with the paid program before


Hopefully it's a big one for the iPad. Interestingly, I didn't notice any shots of the home screen during today's broadcast.


I wish the macs had cellular options. But that would probably do the same thing


Yes, it might....but it also would increase the incentive to buy an iPad Pro.


That. Apple wouldn’t give macOS to iPads, Pro or not. Why cannibalize the Mac market creating cheaper competitors?


What do you think the Big Sur redesign was? Everything is big and chunky and styled for fat-fingering. It's pretty obvious that it'll officially support touch input at some point.


>Because macOS is not optimized for touch. At all. And this is still a device that prioritizes touch input.

While true, you can do a fun little experiment:

If you download something like Screens and remotely log into your Mac from an iPad, everything works fine in touch mode (tap to click where you want, tap with two fingers to simulate a right click, tap and hold to drag something).

Sure, touch targets can be a bit small, but this is something that is relatively simple to fix with UI scaling.

For whatever reason, Apple isn't comfortable with this move yet (maybe it's the App Store revenue?). Hopefully, they'll relax a bit someday and let us unlock the full power of the iPad.


Literally they could sell macOS in the app store as an optional 'app' that opens or boots macOS in a virtualized container and you have best of both worlds and everyone is happy. I would agree that macOS should not be the default operating system by any means.

As it stands today though I use my iPad pro as my main mobile computer but when I need to do something more serious I connect to VPN and RDP into a virtual machine running Windows. It works absolutely amazing but it'd be slick as hell to be able to launch a virtualized macOS natively. 

I'll keep dreaming and logging into Windows when I need a full desktop OS for now, having a trackpad at least makes that a reasonable and pleasant option, but Apple is sort of intentionally gimping the iPad at this point. Even if you forget the OS itself they won't even release their own tools like xcode on it.. they want you to buy a Mac for that for no other reason besides preventing the iPad from further cannibalizing Mac sales. It's silly.


All of Apple’s Big Sur apps are really similar to the iPad apps to the point where you can easily see how touch would work on them. I think in the future they’ll merge the OSes but for now they’ll port apps. Rosetta 2 and M1 makes it a partial possibility.


Can’t use FaceTime for clinic visits with patients as it’s not HIPAA-compliant.


Oooooo, that’s a nice catch


Because it's not cheaper? The base 11" Pro plus Magic Keyboard is $100 more expensive than the entry level Air and that's with less storage. The 12" Pro *starts* $100 more expensive than the Air without adding the keyboard on or matching for storage space.

Hell, 12" Pro + keyboard + 256GB storage is $200 more than the entry level 13" 256GB Macbook Pro and the the same price as 512GB model.


My Hackintosh (Dell XPS 13) actually has a touch display, and it works *surprisingly well* even on Catalina.


What drives me nuts is how they will often switch between using just the product name and using the product name + Air as they introduce and sunset different iterations of a device. 

I'm a firm believer that they should just have - iPhone and iPhone Pro, iPad and iPad Pro, Macbook and Macbook Pro. 

You can have different sizes for these, similar to how you've had it for the Macbook's forever - no more Mini's, no more Plus's, no more Max's, no more Air's.

If you think there is a psychological impact on sales of the base model because it will always be seen inferior to pro, then rename all the base models to Product Name Air. We shouldn't be introducing a 12" Macbook for a few years that was actually a lighter laptop than the Air and then sunsetting it. And now the three main iPad models (Pro, Air, and 10th gen iPad) are such a mess its confusing to keep track of what has the smart connector and where, which one works with which generation of Apple pencil, etc.


this is a mess...even so when you consider the os updates...


[deleted]


i am just in shock at the fact that the second gen (and significantly better) apple pencil doesn’t work on the new ipad but they changed the port to usb-c so you literally just can’t even charge the fucking stylus on the ipad

The current state of the iPad lineup:

|Model|9|10|Mini|Air|Pro 11|Pro 12.9|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cost on Apple's USA site|330|450|500|600|800|1100|
|SoC|A13|A14|A15|M1|M2|M2|
|Screen type|non-laminated|non-laminated|laminated|laminated|laminated|laminated|
|Skips any storage options to upsell you?|yes, 128|yes, 128|yes, 128|yes, 128|no|no|
|3.5mm jack?|yes|no|no|no|no|no|
|Pencil support|1|1, needs dongle|2|2|2|2|

Needless to say, it's shite, especially the 10. Why must Apple make a good-looking cheaper device only to handicap it with that price, the lack of Apple Pencil 2 support, a laminated screen, and the lack of a 3.5mm jack?


The 10th gen iPad only exist to sell someone who doesn’t know any better a iPad, and to push those that do to the Air or Pro. It’s nothing more than Apples clever marketing.


Steve is doing backflips in his grave lmao


The new iPad doesn’t even have a laminated screen and it starts at $450….


10th gen iPad gets a front facing camera on the landscape (long) edge but not the Pro!? Guess I wait for next year. 🙄


[deleted]


apple's naming strategy has become shit like Samsung.. it's really terrible along with their OS updates now. my goodness


Lord help the poor Apple Retail team who has to explain this lineup to customers.

When the M1 Air came out and overlapped with the Pro, I mistakenly thought it meant the next Pro would be a leapfrogging upgrade.

I get the value in hitting every single price point and nudging buyers up the line, but it's just kind of insulting and makes the purchase process fraught with doubt instead of excitement. Give us an iPad, and a Nice iPad.


I mean it's basically "how much money do you want to spend" in ~150ish increments. With the mini being an exception since it's a smaller size.


There's no need for iPad and iPad Air. Combine them into iPad


At that price I might as well buy a laptop that has an actual computer OS.


[deleted]


Took em 11 years but they are now slowly falling back into the habits that nearly killed them before Jobs got called back.


Here’s what I’ve come to realize about the iPad lineup (compared to other Apple products):

the iPad you purchase at a moment in time is the same iPad you are locked into having until you get a new one.  

Don’t expect future cases or accessories to work with it. Do not expect major new features to come to it.


Apple needs FEWER devices and a generally LESS EXPENSIVE lineup.

We are sick and tired of Apple keeping old devices in the lineup to artificially keep prices low.

The phone line would be perfect with: iPhone SE, iPhone and iPhone Pro Max.

The iPad line used to work with iPad mini, iPad and iPad Pro.

The notebook lineup is a similar mess: M1 and M2 Air, 13-inch old style Pro M2 (not the Pro version, though), 14 and 16 inch M1 Pro and Max (ok, they are faster than the M2, but explain that to a buyer).


9th gen is still the way to go. The oldies love em’ and they’re great for people that use them for business. Hell, I’m pretty sure the Apple Store even uses them to run their softwares.


Really starting to look like 90s Apple, way to many models and SKUs.

In terms of iPad; either the Air needs to go, or the 9th gen iPad does and reduce the new 10th gen to its sub 400 price.


Should have just kept Gen 9 around for another year.  Not the best idea.  But better than whatever the hell gen 10 is.  Someone needs to come in and clear house with these garbage hold overs.


It’s really confusing. They need to eliminate half of all of their options.


The only reason I see for the Air to still exist is to justify the price difference between the 10th gen iPad and the iPad Pro. 

Grow a pair and drop the Air. The moniker doesn’t make sense. And since you have the best marketing team in the world, like many in this thread claim, start working on selling why the Pro is so much more expensive.


As a huge apple fan I gotta say I'm so confused by what they have been doing lately. iOS 16 was so buggy, iPhone 14 was a massive disappointment and now this to top it off.


This is what happened when you have a supply chain expert running a company.


The new iPad 10th gen costs 579 fucking € and can't even charge the pencil without an adapter.

What a mess.


The term “Air” has lost all meaning at this point


jobs never would have done this


Tim Cook been doing this since the day he became CEO. Sad to see. Confusing for costumers. Just make the greatest product you can in each category and stop watering everything down.


What do you mean? It makes total sense that the cheap iPad gets the cheaper, lighter keyboard with function keys while the $1500 pro models don’t!


This is how it needs to be and how it should have been from the start, including the names:

2022 11” iPad Pro

2022 12.9” iPad Pro


2022 10.9” iPad

2022 8.4” iPad


2022 10.9” iPad SE

Simple names, simple pricing. They always overcomplicate shit for no reason whatsoever.


There should be 3: small - standard - pro

Now we have an air which is a slightly shittier pro and a base model which is a significantly shittier air


Apple really did shit this year


I’m in the market to replace my Mini 4. I have no idea what to get now. A refurb Air 4 is $20 more than the new iPad 10.


Apple needs someone like Steve Jobs to trim down the product line into something coherent…again.


Nuke the iPad Air model.

Make the iPad Pro 11" start at $649.

Problem solved, one consumer part, one pro part.


Steve Jobs would die if he saw this page lol


Imagine working at a place that sells iPads. Confusing to people coming in


I wonder what the purpose behind this is. The price points aren’t even that far apart to justify it entering an entirely new market. It’s like Apple simply doesn’t want to discontinue a single model even though no one needs this many iPad options with tiny variances between them. 

It should be consolidated to 3 options at most: Pro, Air, Mini.


Time for another shake up and simplification of the product lines!


Mac (mini, studio)

Mac Pro (desktop, rack)

MacBook (12", 14")

MacBook Pro (14", 16")

iPhone (5.4", 6.1", 6.7")

iPhone Pro (5.4", 6.1", 6.7")

iPad (8", 10")

iPad Pro (11", 12.9")

No more air, max, ultra, mini, plus. No more numbers. Just sizes. (Still holding out hope for the smaller iPhone though)


Tim Cook is basically just firing with a blindfold on at this point. None of this makes sense with the 10th gen iPad. Kill the 9th or lower the price point. Like, why wouldn’t you just jump to the Air if you were considering the 10th? Or if everyone wants the 10th, why does the Air exist? This is such mid-90s Apple nonsense now.


Steve Jobs would fire everyone if he saw the mess that the current Apple company has done to the product line. 

6 different iPhone versions, 8 different iPads, 5 variations of Macbook and a wall of adapters and converters needed to power or make them work with Apple’s own products. 

It’s a nightmare, and not at all in line with the vision he had for the company or it’s future.


If you don’t need the laminated display or Pencil 2 support, the 9th gen is still quite good! I use mine every day for all sorts of tasks and it has been flawless. Fantastic battery life.

Amazing deals going on now for it too


the 10th gen ipad is just the ipad Air 4 but worse at the same price


They could solve this by just naming iPads the way they name iPhones. Just call them the iPad 9 and the iPad 10. That’s like 90% of the battle.


The new iPad, which charges via USB C only supports the old Apple Pencil that charges with lightning...?

I'm not a pencil person, so I don't care, but that's a pretty remakable mistake for a company such as Apple.


The worst is the state of iPad accessories, with no continuity in the lineup whatsoever, they're basically becoming ewaste and are going to work only with the iPad you bought.  
The 250$ keyboard made for this iPad doesn't work with other models if you ever want to upgrade, your 250$ keyboard becomes totally useless.  
Same goes for the Apple Pencil Gen 1, what if you want to upgrade to a new iPad in 3/4 years? Your Pencil becomes ewaste.


flag special rock homeless close ripe scandalous paltry chase melodic -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/


I’m getting mini always-we are the same.


Holding off until i see something worth the upgrade. Right now I use a Ipad mini 5, the iPados  bought little improvements to the table even if you have an Ipad pro you wouldn't get all the potential out of it because of the OS limitations...

Hope next year the would bring an Ipad upgrade just like the iphone.


It’s weird that it doesn’t support the new Apple Pencil.


Apple trying very hard to become like Samsung, trying to create a model for every type of buyer. 

Not a fan. Have enough confidence in your products to be able to just have 2 models (normal/air + pro).


Has iPad peaked?

I think so, between the end of 2020 and early 2022, hardwarewise, now its time for software houses to bring the work in, if they will... (decent photoshop would be great)

What do you think?


So which iPad now is the least expensive that supports iPad OS 16 and an Apple Pencil?


Ah yes. The return of the Performa model confusion. 
“What do have there?”
A Macintosh performa 6400
“Cool, which of the 1000 configurations?”


Non laminated screen for that price? Smh


So my 3rd gen iPad Mini 3 that I basically just use for streaming sports and Netflix, etc is on its last legs. From what I’m gathering, the 9th gen iPad would be a better replacement than the 10th gen?


Apple doing apple things


I'm just over here with my mini loving it every time I use it.


Have been waiting to upgrade my iPad Pro… still waiting to upgrade my iPad Pro..


We shouldn’t have to sacrifice features and capability on any level device, especially in 2022. The confusing iPad lineup speaks to the iPad as a whole, which doesn’t have a true identity.  

This is a disgrace. I hope no one buys them. We only will reinforce Apple by purchasing this ass-backward iPad rollout.


Anything with the word "new" is just last gen tech....


This seems like the "fragmentation" and "uninituitive design" that Apple's competitors are lambasted for.


Can the iPad 9th generation use the Apple Pencil 2?


The 10 needs double the base storage for it to be worth the current price.


The reason for the omitting of the Apple Pencil 2 support for the iPad is the new horizontal camera placement AND cost savings needed to do new molds that would support such feature for the least profitable iPad.

The reason for lack of new features is unknown, but I think it’s because of the extra costs that would cause a price bump, that would not go well with customers in the economy recession. Apple did the minimal refresh just maintain (already high) the price point.


So is Apple going to UnLaunch the iPad 10 Gen? Like Nvidia?


iPad should be deleted. iPad Air should be iPad. They just need iPad Pro, iPad, iPad mini.


Canadian pricing is straight trash. So damn expensive.


If Steve Jobs were still alive Apple would have pivoted to something new by now.


I don’t know man, I feel like you guys just love having something to complain about. How does this affect your lives at all? 

It takes 5 min of looking up a spec-sheet to differentiate all of these models and you guys act like there’s a mathematical equation to solve before being in the know.


As somebody who has never owned an iPad but has recently been looking into getting one, is there an "ideal" option that you all would recommend? I doubt it would become a replacement for my main computer, more so I just plan to use it for entertainment on the go and maybe for taking notes in class.


Holy shit. When did the base price of the iPad mini climb to $499?? 
I haven’t followed it over the years but remember the gen 1 was around $329 at launch. Anyone have any insight into why it’s gone up so dramatically?


I bet the new iPads doesn't cost apple 50$ per unit.


i just want an ipad mini pro


No idea what they were thinking. To fix this, they need to cancel the 9th Gen and drop the price of the 10th Gen (hopefully next year) to $399.

iPad - $399

iPad mini - $499

iPad Air - $599

iPad Pro - $799 / $1099

Even with this lineup though, the Air is lacking a purpose, besides the Apple Pencil 2 and Magic Keyboard support that the budget iPad doesn't support. To make the $200 price jump more logical, they should also double the base storage of the Air to 128GB. Once the Pro's go OLED, there will be enough of a different between the Air and Pro to justify the same base storage at the different price points.

I'm curious to see the new iPad Pro design when they FINALLY refresh it. With the landscape webcam right where the apple pencil docks, and with the rumoured dock accessory, I'm wondering how they are going to make it all work. Like how they will incorporate wireless charging when docked, when the smart connecter is currently near the USB port. With the aluminium, I'm not sure how they will get the iPad to charge when docked, while being compatible with different sized models. Regardless, I'm excited to see how the iPad will continue to evolve.

Maybe the Pro's will get a frosted glass back, remove the Smart Connector and rely on an updated MagSafe (iPhone version) to charge the iPad, connect it to the keyboard, and connect it to the dock.


It’s not confusion, it’s the same laddering technique they’ve been doing for sometime now. You keep thinking to yourself, well, you know the next better one is only so much more. And before you know it, you haven’t bought the one you were looking at to begin with.


I just can't get my head around the need for a standard iPad and iPad Air. The rest I don't mind but those two are far too close


It’s the beginning of the slide to mediocrity that Steve predicted.



The overall landscape *is* far more complex today. Not just the naming itself. When Jobs made his return they basically sold laptops and desktops. So a mobile versus desk and pro versus consumer matrix worked perfectly. Now there’s

1.	MacBook
2.	Multiple completely different types  of desktop Mac solutions
3.	iPhone
4.	iPad
5.	Apple Watch
6.	Apple TV/HomePod (as a smart home hub)

Just for core devices, not counting AirPods and Apple Pencils and such. The product lines are more complicated because they’re no longer selling individual products. Not really. They’re selling an ecosystem with multiple interfaces.

But the naming conventions could stand to be more streamlined and consistent. I think they should re-adopt a modified version of the Jobs matrix, maybe something like

1.	Regular [Product] versus [Product] Pro/Ultra (Pro Max is too much. Just call it “Ultra.”)
2.	“size” names where appropriate that don’t conflict with “entry” versus “flagship”designators.
3.	SE shouldn’t be used on a newly updated model every year. Kinda defeats the purpose of “special edition.” Looking at you, Apple Watch. Lol

So for example assuming Apple decided to make *all the iPhones* in a single model year, we could see

1.	iPhone and iPhone Plus
2.	iPhone Pro and iPhone Ultra (because “Pro Max” conflicts with size signaling and is too wordy.)
3.	iPhone Mini or SE depending on what demo they’re trying to capture at the moment or if it’s been a couple years since the last. (I think they might start alternating them or use the mini form factor as the next SE, but anyway…)

The Apple Watch line itself some rebranding. It’s a more nuanced category between material and size variations, but I think they had it closer out of the gate with “Apple Watch Sport,” “Apple Watch,” and “Apple Watch Edition.” They could possibly rebrand the SE as Sport (since it has the activity stuff and heart rate but the more advanced stuff like EKG and SpO2), the steel case as Pro, and then there’s the ruggedized titanium Ultra. Aluminum could just remain Apple Watch.

Not perfect. But a basic concept.


These still don't have OLED?


It's like they accidentally revamped the Air and released it as the regular.


Yesterday I ordered a couple of the new iPads before realizing that the screen was not anti-glare and they would not work with the new pencil. I was able to cancel tonight. I decided the iPad Air was a better fit and only slightly more money. Really a confusing lineup now.


It's iPad pro, semi-pro, semi-semi-pro, iPad old, and semi-pro mini.


Who's a Samsung tab user?


Apple should downsize their products. They try to mimic other manufacturers which has a lot of lineup but, with little to no upgrades.

ex. iPad mini, iPad nth gen, iPad Pros. They should let go of the iPad Air.


I must admit that I don’t understand why the iPad and iPad Air have the SAME screen size where before the air has a bigger screen than the iPad …

And for those who say that the iPad looks like the iPad 4 (2020) it’s kinda true but the iPad 10 has 5G and a better front facing camera vs that iPad Air 🤷‍♂️


I’ve order the iPad Pro 2022, and I have the 2021… after thinking for a while, I will give it back as soon as the package comes home…

(Worst upgrading ever)  first time ever doing these.

Unfortunately Apple is declining in products and ideas, a new air is emergency need it, even a new CEO.


There really should be just iPad and iPad Pro/Max (Pro max for larger size).  That's it.  

iPad Mini is basically a large iPhone. So scratch that. All the other stuff in between is fluff.


I would be happy with a iPhone Pro Max that supports a pencil.


Honestly, they should remove one of the back cameras of the pro and put it as a front facing camera on landscape.


Just tell everyone not to buy the iPad 10


So the class is confuse them into buying the most expensive one? Yeah not surprised. Really getting tired of their naming choices lately.


It doesn't matter. There's 2 types of iPad buyer. 1. Someone that buys the really expensive one   or 2. someone that buys a cheap one.


Sometimes I feel like a fanboy because I don’t get angry at stuff like this, but I just… don’t get how this lineup is confusing.


Steve about to rise from the grave to right this shit.


There are so many god damn iPad variants I have no clue what is out there.


Potential ??? Lol. Speak with your wallet , they'll learn.


This isn’t news.


They need to offer a large screen iPad (12.9”+) without the Pro features for people with visual impairments and the older folks. Yeh Apple offer voiceover and screen zoom, but not everything be with low visions wants or needs those features, sometimes they just need a bigger screen.


may i suggest to also introduce iPad Air Pro, iPad Air Plus, and iPad Pro mini? that should fill all the gaps


I want the cheapest iPad and pencil combo option I can comfortably use for a few years, i I have no fucking idea what iPad to buy.


Nah bc all the descriptions are so vague and similar lmao


Oh no! More choices and I have to make a decision 🤦🏻‍♂️


“Pro” is the new base standard. Apple is already hinting “ultra” is the next pro standard. In 8-10 years, there will be “extreme” models ;)


Was 100% going to buy the new iPad until the price hike shocked me


They should just stop selling 2 different "iPad" models.


iPad Air, 10th should have all been rolled into just one mid range tablet. If you want an entry iPad get the mini or an apple 9th refurb


Bruh…just remove ipad and make the air the “regular ipad” so that its only Ipad, ipad mini and ipad pro.


That price jump is insane.


The issue with the smart connector and pencil compatibility is really only the serious problem here;  Otherwise it's a net positive for people who want an iPad to have three different price points, depending on what they want to get out of the device.  

Really what is called for is a re-adjustment of the apple pencil, just call them basic and pro models to align them with their compatibility.  Same with the folios.


Anyone know what the cheapest iPad, that supports Pencil 2, is? Can be one that has been discontinued by Apple too.


They published this too

*Apple's New 2022 iPad Lineup Gives Customers More Options Than Ever*

https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-ipad-lineup-2022/?Bibblio_source=true


Unless you want the second gen pencil just get the 10th gen


Causes potential confusion?


Once again it’s the ‘Air’ that causes the mess and confusion, there’s no room for it in the lineup now in my opinion, just as there’s no room for an Air in the iPhone lineup. 

Making the standard iPad the new shape has squeezed the Air from below, and failing to deliver significant upgrades to the Pro is squeezing the Air from above. 

Don’t get me wrong, there are still some reasons you might go for an Air over a Pro, specifically Price, but that makes me think it’s another reason to cut the Air, and there are still reasons to go for an Air over a 10 - specifically the Chip, but if the Air was quietly retired (simply not upgraded) over the next year, that means more Pro sales for Apple, and more room for the price of the standard model to grow into and allow it to take on better features like pencil 2 connectivity.


With so many confusing versions of the same product, Apple has become what Steve Jobs feared. Microsoft!


It's a marketing ploy. Not entirely sure how it works. But 
1:consumer confusion.
2: ????
3: Profit


The new iPad 10th gen is £500 in the UK…


Now imagine if they combine the strong point of each one and name it an Ultra lol


Feels like they are reusing designs that already passed regulatory boards until they are out of parts that fit. The standard iPad is the budget that gets last gen's standard stuff, the Air is newer and made to be slim and portable, while the Pro should be the latest and greatest top spec. But that isn't how it seems to work right now.

The Air isn't the base model. We grew to see it as that with the MacBook Air and the price points but it isn't the bottom tier.

They are trying to mimic the product lines across the board.

&#x200B;

iPad, iPad Air, iPad Pro

Macbook, MacBook Air, Macbook Pro

and then they screw it all up with iPhone and the Apple Watch.

iPhone SE, iPhone, iPhone Pro

Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Ultra


Tim Cook is out of his depth.


If my gramps were to visit an Apple Store to buy an iPad then I am sure he would either get the cheapest or the most expensive one cause this is literally so confusing.


The iPad lineup is a complete nightmare at the moment, even I get confused by which models have which features. I can’t even imagine how someone like my parents be able to make sense of it when they walk into shop and say they want to buy an iPad.


I wish they didn’t keep the 9th gen around tbh, but it kind of acts as an iPad SE in the lineup


I'm just pleased I bought my new Air *before* the October event!

I was gonna hold out because sod's law would have them introduce some cool new feature or upgrade right before I bought one, but I though, "nahh I need one now, and the current Air specs more than meet what I need now, so I'm buying it now".

Now (here in the UK) they've hiked the prices!


I just want 120hz on a cheaper model; my 17 Pro has it and I have no upgrade path that isn’t the vastly overpowered M1 or M2 models


The fact that the 10th gen still won’t support Apple Pencil 2 still angers me.


There's two wildly different "iPad Nothing" models now that are simultaneously available for purchase....good grief.


“Steve would have never allowed this!” Steve Jobs had vision for sure but people here that are absolutely convinced that he would never change his stance on products is kinda crazy to me. You literally have no idea what Steve Jobs would be doing now or how he’d view the tech world. He died in 2011….for the tech world that’s a freaking lifetime ago. Times change, tech changes big time, and it’s a possibility that Steve would change too. You can point to his ideals more than a decade ago but you can not say with a certainty he’d still be doing that in 2022.


The iPad lineup is a hot mess.


Someone needs to come in and clean up this entire device name and structure. Pro, ultra, max, mini, air, regular, plus, m1, m2, I mean wtf is going on? Keep it simple. Apple was all about simplicity, now others have better structures in place. There was the regular then the lineup geared more towards professionals, wtf is going on?


It gets even worse with new M series chips.

The M1 MacBook Pro with M1, M1 Pro or M1 Pro Max chips. With 3 different size laptops, but the smallest (the 13 inch) can't be specced with a Pro or a Pro Max but now has an M2 (which is better than M1 but not Pro or Pro Max)... and that has a Touch Bar. But that M2 processor is also in the Air (which will run slightly worse in certain scenarios than an M1 in a different size laptop), but it has no Touch Bar. However, if you want the ultimate chip you need the M1 Ultra (no Pro or Max naming) but that only exists in the Mac Studio (which isn't a laptop).

And so... this Max naming scheme has no bearing on the size of device the consumer uses (just the chip) in the Laptop range but it 'did' with the iPhone range that has now reverted back to using the Plus naming scheme for its larger device (but not their tablets as the larger sizes are only in the Pro lineup).


[And what’s even worse is when they choose to use “Max” and “Plus” on the new iPhones, when both adjectives are *only* used to refer to screen size.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/xe1vu9/why_have_iphone_14_plus_and_max_if_these_2_have/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I’m no marketing guru, ceo, cfo, product line manager, or hardware engineer, but I can’t seem to understand how none of these big brains at Apple can come up with a simpler product lineup.


I wish Apple would read this fucking post. Of course they won't, but I wish this message could somehow get to them.


The air product line used to be true to its name. It was a thinner lighter version of whatever MacBook was out at the time. I’d bet the iPad Air is thinner than a normal iPad.


Steve Jobs is probably rolling over in his grave with this many inconsistent SKUs


beancounters tend to cause this when the aim is to maximize profit instead of focusing on the product


>I'm a firm believer that they should just have - iPhone and iPhone Pro, iPad and iPad Pro, Macbook and Macbook Pro. 

I agree but... we should have a budget line for ipad and mac too, just like the iphones have iphone SE. No idea abot what name should be used tho.


I *so* agree. Remember the early 2000s? The SKUs were reduced dramatically, and most products had three options: Good, Better, Best.

You could add "SE" on iPad as well, than you have 3 devices like iPhone and Watch.

iPad Pro -> iPad Pro

iPad Air -> iPad

iPad -> iPad SE


Are you saying the iPhone mini air max ultra pro SE isn’t clear?


100% there with you. They are just after the profits. Don’t forget they also have Ultra!


You’re gonna hate the 2023 iPhone 15 Pro MAX 6.7” with M3 Ultra (16th gen)!


To be fair, I absolutely love my iPad Mini. I think there is a definite use case for that model.


I think 3 tiers is fine. Air —> normal —> pro. So macbook air, macbook, macbook pro. Same for the phones. The SE should be iphone air, then iphone, then iphone pro.


Yeah. I know the names won't be too consistent because it's all marketing but the features themselves are a jumbled mess.


[deleted]


It’s been a mess for years and never has made sense. Not sure why Apple does this.


[deleted]


What do you mean by the OS updates? Do they add or reduce confusion?


I’m guessing they will eventually drop the Air version, this latest generation iPad is so similar to the Air. So IPad, iPad Pro, iPad mini


Bro how is this a mess? You guys need to seriously get a grip. There are currently 6 iPads.. how hard can it be to figure out which one is best for you? Look up the spec sheet, compare the price boom, like 5 min of actual research.


It’s been confusing since they called the iPad 3 ‘The New iPad’.

Then the iPad Air and Mini 2 came out where they seemingly dropped the regular ‘iPad’ model. But the next year they went from the Air and Mini 2 sharing the exact same internals to the Mini 3’s only update being Touch ID…

Why do we even have so many different types of iPads? Take a note from Steve’s “4 quadrants” and make one for consumers, one for professionals, and smaller sizes for each one.


It's not hard to simplify the product line, them just choosing not to is weird after them being known for it. 

They also need to unify all these names better.  What the hell is an iPad Air? When the MacBook Air came out, it was a thinner and lighter version of the MacBook.  The iPad Air is .3lbs lighter than the iPad 10th Gen.   But it's better than the 10th Gen?

They should also get rid of all these generations indicators. Just call it the 2022 iPad.  Done.


Not a chance in hell Jobs would have allowed this. He knew what a disaster it was in the 90s when Apple’s naming scheme became shit like “Macintosh Quadra M55500SC II”.

Both Jobs eras (‘76-85, ‘97-11) were marked by consistent, short, intelligible naming systems for products.


A MagSafe type dock/charger for the pencil two, would have made more sense than the dongle.


They love dongles


The Pencil 2’s only advantage is that it charges magnetically. That may be a huge plus for some, but it’s not for others.

I’ve had mine since the original iPad Pro came out in 2016, and it’s just fine to charge it via lightning port. Works great for me.

Edit: wow. I describe what works for me, and people hate it. Talk about irrational…


[deleted]


Eh, I think the base level budget iPad deserves to exist.


I would drop the Air moniker and have iPad, iPad mini, iPad Pro, and iPad Pro Max (the 12.9 inch.

Basically the same way they did the iPhone 13 lineup. That was easy to understand.


It needs to fall into the classic 2x2 product grid Apple used to do. 

Pro and consumer, large and small. 

iPad and iPad Plus are the consumer versions. iPad Pro and iPad Pro Max is the pro version. Maybe keep the mini around cause it’s tiny and kind of between the pro and consumer models.


That doesn’t make sense, they need a budget ‘school’ iPad. Which is why the 9th gen is still there. The only problem is this new iPad that just makes no sense at that price.


It was like this for a while in the 2010s. Pro, regular, mini.


Better yet, have the “iPad” in two sizes (formally ‘mini’ and ‘Air’), and turn the budget model into the iPad SE.

Like they do with the iPhone.


Honestly they can just get rid of mini as well. It’s basically the same as an iPhone max.

Be consistent: regular and pro model across their products.


iPad Mini goes on sale for $399 frequently. It’s best deal on any Apple product, IMO.


At the minimum pencil 2 support should be there. Absolute trash that you have the body for it but fail to add the magnet charger which is on every new ipad model. Plus it’s more expensive. Wtf


Perhaps Apple compromised with a landscape camera module in the location where the Pencil 2's induction charger could have been. 

Might a laminated screen hike the price further and make it too similar to the Air?

As for lack of a 3.5mm jack, given how it's removed on the higher end iPads we knew this was going to happen inevitably.


At this point, anyone looking at the 10 should buy the 9 or the Mini, which is a bizarre situation at best.


I just learned the 10th gen iPad screen is not laminated. C'mon.


Idk how this is shit. You spend more money you get more features


That’s not clever marketing if it involves making and actual product you have to produce and support.  Lever is getting results you want without that.


Congrats on discovering the business purpose of base models!

But you missed the fleet/corporate use case. Rental car companies and corporate fleets also buy base model cars and computers. Why would you put something more expensive in a kiosk?


[deleted]


I bought a mint condition used Air 4 for $240 recently and was worried the new iPad announcement was gonna make my Air less of a good deal. Instead it seems to be quite the opposite.


It's also the model that users like parents and grandparents are likely to gravitate towards, not because they "don't know any better" but because they don't need anything more. It's got a more sensibly placed facetime camera, perfect for calling family members etc., it doesn't have more expensive Apple Pencil 2 tech in because the vast majority of users probably won't ever buy one, and the use cases that do (schools etc.) probably won't need any more than the Gen 1, and realistically anyone who does need more isn't looking at this iPad as their device anyways. Reddit, and indeed tech journalism in general, has a *really* bad habit of assuming that because they don't need or want something, it is therefore a bad design choice. The worst thing about this iPad is the inflated price, albeit not unexpected. Everything else is absolutely fine, and the vast majority of purchasers of this particular model won't be bothered about tech specs and feature sets. And the users who are will probably be the ones banging on about upgrading from last years Pro model or something like that. This is the iPad for people whose 2017/18 iPad is finally on its last legs and the battery is about to collapse. And it will probably last just as long for them as well.


Where does the mini land? I wonder if Apple is going to do an iPad SE sometime down the line to revive the current iPad with lighting.


$150 is a lot of money, enough that people will still gravitate towards the "cheaper" one.


I am sure that is what Apple hopes. In reality, it now makes much more sense to buy the 9th refurbished.

It makes no sense to buy the Air, and even less sense to buy the pro.


It’s Apple trying to be competitive in the tablet market at every price point


seriously - this is exactly what he walked into at Apple in 1997 but with the countess Macintosh models that their own product managers couldn't tell him what differentiated them and why they existed, so he scrapped them all

https://www.podfeet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Steve-Jobs-2x2-Matrix-Product-Strategy.png

good article on the current problem too I found when searching for the above image: https://www.podfeet.com/blog/2022/03/apple-computer-history-diagram/


Not with how many skus of iPad he was selling


For 64GB. At that point, they should have made it at least 128GB


And where does the pencil charge?


What happens if you wait a year and they don’t move the camera?


Both are true.


MacRumors tomorrow:

MacRumors' New 2022 Apple Lineup Articles Give Readers More Opinions Than Ever


the new stupid feature for ipad is only available in certain model and sucks


Quality is on a downward trend. They need to get back to basics.


I like the naming Google is doing for the last few generations of pixel phones, like the current line up is: 6a, 7, 7 Pro



>makes the purchase process fraught with doubt instead of excitement.

There's a study that proves too much consumer choice can be bad. They opened 2 jeans stores. One only had 4 options to choose from. One had 23 options to choose from with different styles and patterns. Not only did the store with 23 different jeans have less customers. But most people that did buy something straight up said they didn't feel satisfied with their decision


> Lord help the poor Apple Retail team who has to explain this lineup to customers.

"What is your budget?" "So x is the best option under your budget and if you're able to increase it a little y is the best option."


> With the mini being an exception since it's a smaller size.

Unless it was the iPhone 13 mini lol.


…and a real file system 

…and support for hundreds of peripherals 

…and no need for half a dozen dongles and adapters 

…and modular components you can upgrade 

…and a higher resolution display

…and using industry standard ports and protocols, not legacy Lightning connectors


What's a computer


They probably put it at the end because it’s smaller and as a result looks better there.


It’s in order of screen size


The products from that era had a major difference though most of them didn’t sell.


What an exaggeration


Should be called iPad SE.


Just chiming in to confirm that, yes, Apple Stores use 9th gen iPad to run their store software like Concierge and Mobile Genius.


I was pretty shocked the 10th gen didn’t replace the 9th gen completely, at $399.


This comment should have more upvotes


Yeah this makes no sense. When I saw that folio/keyboard case in the Apple reveal video I thought “oh wow, function keys! That’ll be a nice update to the pro Magic Keyboard folio…” and then they showed the same pro product with no update???


Pro, air/ipad, mini 

Small, regular, large. Easiest


iPad Pro 12.9"

iPad Air 11" 

iPad 10.9" 

iPad mini 8.4"


Mostly agree, I’d keep the iPad Mini name though. iPad Pro in two sizes, iPad Air and Mini should be one product line as iPad and iPad Mini, then low end iPad can be SE.


This is the ideal Pro, Consumer, Budget product lineup. Today’s Apple screws it up with multiple budget products and an Air line that exists because the naming is popular.


I would simplify it a step further.

iPad mini

iPad

iPad Pro (11-inch)

iPad Pro Max (12.9-inch)


Refurb 4 or Mini 6.


Oh boy do I have some news for you


[removed]


I think the price increase from the 9th generation iPad to the 10th generation iPad is a harbinger of price increases throughout the lineup. 

* 2023: iPad Air (6th gen) adds an M2, Face ID, and a price increase from $599 to $699. 
* 2024 [H1](https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1582501956546723840): iPad Pro (7th gen) adds an M3 and OLED. I suspect that it will get a price increase due to the OLED display, and the 11" will likely get a larger price increase than the 12.9" because the former has regular LED while the latter has mini-LED. So perhaps something like $799 → $999 for the 11" and $1099 → $1199 for the 12.9". 

At some point the 9th gen iPad will be discontinued and then we'll have a lineup rather similar to the mid-2022 iPad lineup, but with the prices having gone up by a hundred or two. 

The mid-2022 lineup: 

* 10.2" iPad 9: $329 
* 8.3" iPad mini 6: $499 
* 10.9" iPad Air 5: $599 
* 11" iPad Pro 5: $799 
* 12.9" iPad Pro 5: $1099 

My speculated early/mid-2024 lineup: 

* 10.9" iPad 11: $449 
* 8.3" iPad mini 7: $599? 
* 10.9" iPad Air 6: $699 
* 11" iPad Pro 6: $999 
* 12.9" iPad Pro 6: $1199


Sizes are not sufficient. See iPad mini vs iPad


Air has a newer/better SoC, compared to the ipad 10th gen.


it has the best battery life among ipads

> Apple ships a lot of products that I'm not the target market for, and I think it means they are ripping off all those dumb sheeple who aren't just like me. I don't understand why people see value in those products, so there must be none, because surely I represent the sum total of the entire retail hardware market. 

> Apple sure is clever and evil to do all that market research to determine what idiots will pay for and then to ship products exactly like that, so the idiots gladly hand over money for a product they think they want but actually don't.


Dude, people wouldn't be shoveling money their way if they didn't make good products.  In tech, you can't go anywhere based purely on marketing, especially nowadays where opinions of reviewers and actual users are so easily accessible online

The new 10th gen iPad seems to be shit and make the lineup confusing, the majority agrees on this, but that doesn't mean other products are bad

I would have bought the mini if it only had a 120hz screen.


Best alternatives for the new iPads  right now are:

iPad M1 Pro - if you’re looking for 120hz, quad speakers and 128gb minimum storage

iPad Air 4 - if you’re looking for a cheaper iPad with no big compromises to the screen and the same chip as the new iPad


I tend to agree. Their product lineup has become pretty stale (and I'm an Apple fan). They're no longer innovating but simply supplying product on an already saturated market. Jobs took risks which is the difference between then and now.


Super easy for me but for people like my parents or grandparents or nieces or newphews, they’d have no idea. Whoever was in charge of these specific choices should be fired because it’s going to confuse a TON of people.


iPad 9 if you don’t need all the extra features. It’s more than enough


Well, they have successfully turned me of from being interested in their iPad lineup TBH. I think Apple Silicon Macbooks are already good enough for me.


Ironically, Apple used to pride themselves in having a small but clear matrix of products.


The Air 4 is probably the the cheapest one when it was new.


There is no "Pro Max", there is only M1 Pro _and_ M1 Max.

But yeah, the names are starting to get confusing.


This. I’m fairly into this stuff and it took me 1 hour of research to figure out which one I wanted due to confusing names.


I am a little more understanding here because I think for a large portion of the userbase, they do not care about the distinction of CPU. But I will agree that I would have preferred they stayed away from the Max name in that line


Selling a MacBook pro with M2 while the rest have M1 Pro or Max chips is equally confusing, as the M2 is generally behind those other in performance, but it is also newer.


That’s nuts.


The M1 Pro is better than the m2? I feel like that’s wrong or they wouldn’t release it.
Like having the iPhone 14 be worse than the iPhone 13 pro


**iPad Pro Max Air Plus**


Remember when Steve Jobs came back to Apple and cleaned up the computer line; they need to do that for all their products.


Yeah I always wondered why they needed size adjectives for phones, but not for any other device. 

MacBook Pro?  14” or 16”

iPad Pro? 11” or 12.9”

Apple Watch?  41mm or 45mm

Then you get to ipad (regular) and iphone…

“Air, Max, Plus” huh?


I don’t think they want a simple lineup. They want the ability to sell any product line at any price ranging from 300 to 1000+ $, to get as many consumers as possible, and try to provide incremental value at each step. They should be commended for continuing to provide 90% of the capability on the low cost models.


What do AirPods, the iPhone 14 Pro, and the M1 chip have in common?

They all have a Max variant.


This is a pretty big sub, it’s safe to assume Apple employees use Reddit, Apple just doesn’t care.


Because the people who make these naming decisions get paid to make these terrible naming decisions.


Then they should read Apple's history. When Steve Jobs came back to save Apple, one of the first things he did was he got rid of a ton of products to make choices more simple for consumers.


I mean, someone can email it to Craig, who might forward it along. I’ve emailed him before and got a reply…you can figure out his email with some elbow grease haha


>I’d bet the iPad Air is thinner than a normal iPad.

It technically is, but only by 0.9mm. And it's lighter by only 16g. All of the other physical dimensions are within 1mm of each other as well.


And then the all-new “MacBook” was released, which was thinner and lighter than the Air.

And then they got rid of the MacBook, and then just remade the “Air”

Makes no fucking sense


It was when it launched in 2013!


Steve would have fired the guy who came up with the “Pro Max” moniker on the spot, lmao.


Was about to comment this. Not a chance in hell he’d have allowed this. He knew what a disaster it was in the 90s when their naming scheme became shit like “Macintosh Quadra M55500SC II”.

Both Jobs eras (‘76-85, ‘97-11) were marked by consistent, short, intelligible naming systems for products.


Wasn’t his literal first move to eliminate confusing product lines of the 90s?

It was like a table of Pro and Consumer, and Portable and Desktop.
Leading to the iBook and iMac and PowerMac and PowerBook. Obviously it’d need a little more nuance today, but why can’t Apple go back to this philosophy.


> we should have a budget line for ipad and mac too

I suppose you could have different tiers (processors, screen size, SDD size, etc.) under the "MacBook" umbrella. Same with Pro. Downside being most customers don't understand specs, so you're kind of right back where you were - Apple thinks it's simpler to just use the "Air" designation for models with mid-range specs.

Regardless, consumers will have a hell of a time figuring out the differences between the base, Air, and Pro models. Hell, it's confusing to Apple geeks, as evidenced by this very thread.


well yes ok, but to MS's credit, they aren't putting arbitrary limitations between one another. you had the OG Xbox, the 360, the one, and later One X and lower one S, and now the series X and series S. Its difficult from one gen to the next but not within the same generation as each SKU targets a different pricepoint and featureset.


If you take a step back, “SE” is actually a stupid moniker as well. Incongruent with “Pro”.


The small one is more expensive than the "default" one?


Any Pro: I actually need it or my work pays for any iPad I want


Broke college students actually buy old laptops and replace them with new SSD and RAM.


I have the pro. It plays music to my soundbar and sometimes YouTube. Huge waste of money.


Tbh I think your Air 5 description is the 9th & 10th gen. I’m not even sure where the Air fits. “I want style & a slightly thinner & better screen, not quite pro level.”!?

And yea a broke college won’t be getting an iPad pretty much lol.


I want an Air or a Mini, but not until they have 120hz refresh.


[deleted]


Supply chain and manufacturing line efficiencies.  This is Tim Cook's bread and butter.  The 9th gen iPad is probably the most profitable version despite being lowest price.


[deleted]


> Why do we even have so many different types of iPads? Take a note from Steve’s “4 quadrants” and make one for consumers, one for professionals, and smaller sizes for each one.

I feel like they already have.  The base iPad is for the consumption-heavy/budget-oriented consumers, Air is for the other consumers, Pro is for 'professionals' who need a lot of performance, and Mini is for folks who want a different size.  That's a pretty solid 4 quadrant line-up.

The problem is that Apple has done a shit-job with the naming scheme, and the features across models(especially when it comes to justifying each price-point, where most consumers get increasingly less for pretty major jumps in price).

Half the iPad model names are relics from 2013 when the Air was replacing a nearly 1.5lb behemoth of a tablet.  iPad has been the budget option for years now, and should be labeled consistently with the other budget products they offer that use the exact same methods of subidizing their low-cost: it should be the iPad SE.  Air's core features differentiating it from the iPad are also no longer it's weight/thinness, it's the current-gen features(M1 chip, laminated display, Pencil 2 support) that should just make it a plain old iPad.

That's an easy way for Apple to simplify things and clear up consumer confusion on what the fuck each model is meant to be.

The harder part is figuring out the complete clusterfuck of features and pricing.  The Mini is more expensive than the base model, but has worse hardware than the Air so it's not as simple as saying 'it's an Air but smaller.' The base model just got a price increase that requires the *previous gen* to act as the budget option....while remaining saddled with now-confusing budget model features and limitations(except for, inexplicably, the landscape camera).  Part of this is because there isn't much you *can* add to the new base model, since the massive price jump from the 9th gen to the Air already presented a pretty dubious value to large swathes of consumers. Then you have the Pro models whose RAM inexplicably changes depending upon memory size, and which somehow are *lacking features* found on the base model, *and* which are bumping into the limitations of the OS because of Apple's squeamishness about cannibalization of other products.


One thing I can’t stand with those generation indicators specifically is how the 11 inch iPad Pro, according to Apple, is at a different generation than the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. If I recall correctly the website calls the M2 iPad Pro’s the 11” iPad Pro (4th gen) and 12.9” iPad Pro (6th gen). I understand that the smaller Pro received a different screen size in 2018, but it’s… still the same product line?? 

So if you use the comparing tool on Apple’s website, you can select the fourth generation 11 inch iPad Pro with the M2 from 2022, as well as a fourth generation 12.9 inch iPad Pro with the A12Z from 2020. It just doesn’t make any sense.


>	It’s not hard to simplify the product line

God, Reddit pundits and their insane overconfidence will never cease to amaze me. 

Simplifying product lines, especially with how Apple has been functioning over the last few years with reusing older parts with newer devices, would cost millions (if not billions). 

It’s mainly that _at the moment_, it makes zero business sense to do it. It sucks, but the incremental confusion that’s there in recommending an iPad to one’s parents/non-tech savvy people right now is offset by the massive savings in not having to completely rejig your entire manufacturing process. 

Unfortunately, at the sheer scale Apple is operating in, I don’t see this changing anytime soon. 

Older hardware (M1 MBA, M2 MBP, $329 iPad) is gonna stick around to fulfil the cheapest price points, while newer designs (no matter how incremental) will be priced higher for perception and marketing reasons.

There’s a great case to be made for simplified product lines, but given the iPads have negligible competition, I genuinely don’t see Apple taking a significant hit in the tablet market for a few years.


> They should also get rid of all these generations indicators. Just call it the 2022 iPad.  Done.

They you could more easily tell how old the model is. Who wants a mini (2022) in 2023? But the newest 6th gen mini in 2023? Sold!


That would require innovation...

Really they just went with the cheaper option, and given the Apple TV remote just went USB C given no notification, I suspect this is Apple streamlining that they'll never release a lightning based product again, and the decision was made last minute.


How can it NOT be a plus to charge it magnetically without a cable?


My Apple Pencil literally never dies.


Apple likes the "Air" branding, probably due to the MacBook Air being so popular for so many years.


The Air should be discontinued. I can't even tell if it's better or worse than the regular iPad. They look exactly the same.


I agree with you. Though I would also say I don't know the point of the pros.


The Air and base iPad branding feel like weird holdovers from a decade ago when the Air genuinely brought a MAJOR reduction in the weight of the iPad and when the base iPad had been the flagship model.

It no longer makes any fucking sense in 2023 except to whatever dumbass suits think it's somehow clever synergy with the Macbook Air instead of just bizarre.

The base iPad should be an SE product, that's literally been it's pricing and design model for years now.  The Air is essentially the cheapest option for someone who wants an iPad with current gen hardware but doesn't need anything particularly fancy, and should just be the iPad.

(Mind you, the pricing structure and the actual features in each device is a different story.  The 10th gen in particular is an utter clusterfuck of features and bad pricing.)


So true, I don’t think it’ll be going away anytime soon. There is still a $100+ difference between the 9th gen and the newly released 10th gen iPad.

On a side note - The new, “not so budget” iPad doesn’t make sense in the lineup. Idk why they released it at all. To simplify the lineup, they could reduce the Air’s price to start at $450 and actually update the base model iPad to support Apple Pencil 2 and USB C (with a slight price increase).


Then call it iPad SE.


Personally I wouldn’t even give the different sizes different names. I personally really like how the Apple Watch and iPad Pro’s do it, Apple Watch 41/45mm and iPad Pro 11”/12.9”. So it’d be something like the iPad (8.3 inch), iPad (11 inch) and iPad (12.9 inch). Idk, I don’t know how the names affect sales and all that, but it just feels more cohesive to me.


But that was not the original matrix. The original matrix was pro vs consumer and stationary vs portable.

So there is no reason not to have a 2x3 or 3x3 matrix.

I would say have an iPad as the consumer model, and then have it in two different sizes (one of which is the mini), then a pro version that is also in two different sizes. It will have a better screen and two usb-c inputs.

For the consumer version, don't have a keyboard that is so awesome it has to be more than half the price of the device.

And keep selling the pencil one, but don't make the new iPads use it.


I personally wouldn't mind 2x3 this time round - pro/consumer, large, *medium* and small. You could then apply it to iThings and Macthings alike.

Unfortunately for us, we do not have a product person in charge of Apple right now. More like the bad old Amelio days except this one has some product to build on.

Even more unfortunately for us (the buyers), Cook is far, far beyond Amelio in terms of growing and keeping a company going. So from the company and stock holder point of view, he's fantastic. From us wanting to buy into the ecosystem again and in fact working out what the ecosystem is even meant to be these days...somewhat less good.


That's just not true? They're very different screen sizes and have different functionality (camera, cellular, Pencil), OSes, and price points.


Also you can buy any iPad [with the education discount](https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store), even if you're not a student. They don't check if you order online and have it delivered.


I doubt the laminated screen is still done to save manufacturing costs almost a decade after it was introduced to the iPad Air 2. They have separate digitizers so when a school buys 2000 of them, the 100 repairs they need a year will be cheaper.


Just like the one before. If it was you’d complain even more about the price


There's still 9th gen iPad on sale for those customers, I don't think they would overpay for the 10th gen


Yup. We use the base iPad here in hospitals. We don’t need all the extra features. It’s used to take pictures, open charts, and occasionally used to run an interpreter phone call through the app.


The real question is: why would you pay $120 more for the 10th generation? Just get her the 9th gen, it will serve just fine for many years to come. 
It is often on sale for much less as well (I’ve seen it on sale dor $269 on Amazon)


This is a similar question that i am going through right now , i have an original ipad pro 9.7 I think its getting close to 6 years old and I don't think it gets any more updates as well as battery life is pretty poor right now so am looking at the different options now for new ipad. I dont think i need to go pro as I didn't really use any of the pro features. I see most people saying to go with 9th gen ipad , but I hate all that wasted space on the bottom where touch id button is, but its also probably not worth 120 worth or so just for the extra space.


The mini is kinda in its own category.


I find the current macbook lineup pretty straightforward, air -> 14 -> 16. With the 13 pro being an outlier. 

But overall I agree they should aim towards simplicity, ipad and iphone getting a little out of hand. If they could just have feature parity and a size difference (mini -> mid -> max) on the phones that would be excellent and you could just choose without worrying about features, all iphones would be the best iphone. But I'm not sure that would work practically with costs / large cameras etc.


Having many options is a double-edged sword, so keeping it simple is always best IMO.  Apple needs to slim down the options to keep things simple.


That’s a terrible article. It’s comparing an oversimplified product matrix (consumer/pro) to choosing your *processor*.

The consumer/pro matrix still exists. You either buy a MacBook Air, or a MacBook Pro. 

That’s not even getting into the reality that Apple in 2022 is a vastly different company than Apple in 1997, and what made sense in. 1997 is not necessarily the right move in 2022.


Remember the Mac matrix? So simple.


>seriously - this is exactly what he walked into at Apple in 1997 but with the countess Macintosh models that their own product managers couldn't tell him what differentiated them and why they existed, so he scrapped them all

People need to stop citing the four-quadrant grid as some sort of product lineup ideal when it was true for only four years. In 2002 Apple announced the eMac and the Mac lineup [has never returned to the four quadrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Complete_timeline_of_Mac_models). 

If Apple had to cut down the current iPad lineup, they'd probably start by getting rid of the mini (and given the comments on this thread, I suspect that it would be [an unpopular decision in the Apple community](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight)).


This. Seriously. It’ll be a couple years but we’ll all look back at it and see all the signs.

Edit: I say this as the biggest Apple fan I know. I’ve been a devotee since 2005 when I could afford my first iPod shuffle as a teen. 

I’ve been an iPhone user since the first one. Devoted. 

As profitable as I know these kinds of moves are, this isn’t the soul of the company I embarrassingly fell in love with 17 years ago. 

Apple, like the country they were founded in, is in a battle for its soul. I think they can find it again. This kind of piddly-ass-bullshit is not the right direction in my opinion.


Every color and storage capacity necessitates a different SKU. SKUs are not the problem. It’s the senseless, confusing stratification of features across a lengthy line of products.


This is the problem, that no one appreciates. It's why neither product has both.

And it's unfortunate. Maybe they can eventually move the pencil magnets up or down. But can't go up, because there are more cameras there. It would have to go down. Or maybe to the top.


I would think that you’d move the pencil charger to the side where the camera used to be.  But IANA engineer.


through the ipad charger. it’s a gen 1 with an adapter.


Then I wait another year 😂 Seriously, my 12.9" iPad Pro works fine. Just annoyed at having to move my hand for Face ID multiple times a day. 

If Apple made a 12.9" iPad 10th gen, I’d jump on it.

Or the long awaited VR headset.


Eh, they used to do XL before switching to Pro so it's kinda inconsistent. And it's not that clear that the #a line is seperate from the main line and is their budget/midrange line.


iPad Pro


Some of the names people are suggesting here are just as bad as the way Apple’s got them already.


Honestly what's the point of the "Air" moniker when they're all roughly the same dimensions?

Just give us 

iPad (8.4" & 10.9")

iPad Pro (11" & 12.9")


Nah, still too all over the place.


Still too complicated. The iPad mini is basically just a smaller iPad Air, might as well just merge them into one name distinguishable by screen size.


And because they’re just straight-up stupid a lot of the time too.


That’s not simplifying anything further, it’s making it more complicated. Jesus dude I don’t think anybody responding with their own name suggestions got my original point.


I know there are actual differences - I nearly got the Air earlier this year - I was just approaching it from a price point of view. If Apple has evidence people would prefer something like the 10th vs the Air, why keep the Air around. Their strategy around the iPads is a convoluted mess and it's just another example of what happens when the accountants run the company vs when people with a vision for products do.


What is the target market for a device that requires both USB-C and lightning cables?

I just don't find the premium hardware quality with the other brands. 

They race to the bottom to make a healthier margin, **they can't help themselves**. Lots of chintzy, cheap "Piano black" plastic glossy stuff and rubberized pieces, not a lot of aluminum or stainless steel.

Windows 11, ultimately, is Windows 10... which means it'll greet you with pop-up dialog box errors on boot, instead of quietly dumping it to event viewer or the macOS console.


Apple is more accessible and affordable then it was before the iPod. I remember in my 20’s only being able to afford an iPod and it still cost me over $500. If a product doesn’t feel worth your money don’t buy it or wait for a sale. I love my AirPods Max but couldn’t justify the cost until I was able to get them from a 3rd party retailer at a $100 discount. Apple currently offers more products for people with less income then probably ever though. Except in those countries where the current currency exchange is now awful.


What are you talking about. People that get confused by stuff like this go to apple stores or ask friends and family for help.

I work in an authorized apple resell store and older people come to us and even back when the AirPod lineup consisted of 2.Gen and Pro they still got confused about that. People that aren’t Davy with tech get confused about wether or not to get an iPhone 14 or 14 Pro.. u can’t simplify it for them.  

Trust me this company named apple knows a fuck ton more about branding and all that then you all combined in this subreddit do


True, but I’d rather have more choices rather than fewer. It’s also rather interesting that this same subreddit will also complain when they don’t have a product with very specific features.


Yeah, Pro Max is only used on the iPhone line, *for now* /s


y’all are complaining bout this… don’t even get me started with Intel or AMD chip naming… Apple still wins.

Also sir I think you’re confused at why certain MacBooks with the same chip can be different speeds. Adding the fan and cooling in the MacBook Pro allows the regular M1 to go that much farther. M2 is faster than M1, but not if the M1 was put in a MacBook Pro. You need to realize that is why there is a difference. When M2 comes to Pro then you’ll see the difference.

Also the Touch Bar is being phased out as you can see from the recent MacbBook Pro & Air.

They are not getting rid of the Max naming. We Still have four iPhones.

iPhone 14 & iPhone 14 Plus

&

iPhone 14 Pro & iPhone 14 Pro Max.

the only thing that changed was instead of the lower end iPhone having a “mini” they took that small size out and made a larger one than the current and called it “Plus” like their old iPhone naming model. Quite frankly I like their naming and I think they do it really well. For the iPads it is a little confusing, as we have a MacBook Air which is cheaper than the base model MacBook. But here with iPad’s the Air cost more than the regular iPad. I think they just plainly need to drop the iPad lineup.


I agree the m series are okay (for now), you have three verticals: normal, pro and ultra

M2 will be more powerful than M1

M2 pro will be more powerful than M1 pro

M2 ultra will be more powerful than M1 ultra


Just like a new i5 is worse than last years i9, not really that bad, the generation improvement just isn’t that big


You're always going to get that when you have two tiers of product. Last year's server-grade CPU is going to be faster than this year's mobile CPU. Last year's MacBook Pro is going to be "better" in most ways than this year's MacBook Air.


[deleted]


different tiers of performance and power consumption (and price), the M2 is a refinement/improvement to the base M1, it does more with an equal amount of power. The M1 Pro/Max/Ultra are basically different arrangements of the M1, basically multiple M1 working together, and given more power to operate and do more. They will perform better than a base M2, but when time comes that we have M2 Pro/Max/Ultra all the improvements of M2 given more power to operate will hopefully perform better than their M1 counterparts.


>Max Air Plus

turning into Nike Shoes at this point


The iPad Air Plus Pro Max is completely different.


iPad Pro Max Air Plus Ultra Mini + S Studio SE with MagSafe


I was going to mention this as well. He cut the product line from 350 down to 10 so they could focus on making those core products great and I think that’s the right move here as well. Too much choice will frustrate buyers and end up driving them away.


That's borne out of the iPhone 6 playing catch up on screen size, you'd had several years of Android phones with much larger screens, one of the only times I remember Apple being perceived as emulating their direct competition.

Having a 5.5" model characterized as "plus" was important in marketings' mind.

You had phones like the Xperia Z Ultra a year prior with an awesome 6.44" screen and the Nexus 6 with a 5.96" screen the 5.5" 6 Plus was directly competing with. Not to mention the Galaxy Note phones which had a 5.7" for a year by the time the 6 plus hit the market.

After the plus model iphones overtook the phablet market all of the big screened Android phones shrank to 5.5" which was incredibly annoying.

But Apple needing to make it clear that they'd entered the larger screened market that had been in full swing for several years made a "Plus" designation make sense. The Plus phones became such a runaway success that larger Android flagships all shrank to the same 5.5" size. It makes sense that Apple would keep size descriptors given the series success.


Iterating that too, not sure why we need a numbered title too on iPhones anymore, were on iPhone 14, but iPads, Apple Watch, Mac's are labeled the year or possibly the generation in individual lineup.


I think you're spot on about what they want, but at this point their obsession with filling out every possible point on the pricing ladder is starting to become confusing and detrimental to the consumer, at least with the iPad lineup.  It doesn't help that the models are just sort of a wild mishmash of features and price-points(see the lack of Pencil 2 support on 10th gen despite being USB-C, or the landscape camera not coming to the Pro model) that don't really hang together in any logical way...unless maybe you're a suit at Apple.

> They should be commended for continuing to provide 90% of the capability on the low cost models.

I can agree on that. Apple absolutely will bleed you dry if you need anything more than the basics, but most of their products have baseline options that are *very* well priced for not just how many features you get, but how reliable the product is for the price.  Try finding a PC OEM that sells for the same price(especially when on sale) as the M1 Mini, which offers as much power and which doesn't skimp on less-sexy components like PSUs; or an Android tablet that will work as well as the iPad 9 does at $329. 

Mind you, the price increase on the 10 kinda fucks that up a lot.


And what "Max" means is different for each product line!


So where is the iPad Pro Max, and MacBook Pro Max?


I think some Apple employees care. But higher ups probably won't


Which is one of the reasons I liked Apple. It was easy. You wanted an iPhone you bought an iPhone. You didn't have to sift through and compare multiple devices and make compromises on features depending on which device. I was looking at MacBook's last night and stopped. Was taking too much effort which requires more time to sit down and go through.


Why even bother making different sized devices at that point? Just make them all the same so all the cases/keyboards out there fit all the devices.


Possibly true for the man, definitely true for the persona. But oh do I personally hate that bloated moniker. Doubly so now that they’ve revived the “Plus.” It’s just unnecessary.

“Pro Max” should now be “Ultra.” I also think they should drop “SE.” The Apple Watch SE can be rebranded with the original “Sport” designation. The iPhone SE can be revived every other year or so as the “Mini,” as I hope they’re finally ready to leave the Home Button in the past for good this time.


Dude, [Jobs wanted to call MacMan the iMac.](https://www.fastcompany.com/1669924/steve-jobs-almost-named-the-imac-the-macman-until-this-guy-stopped-him)


This is really what made him (and apple) so successful. Sure he had an eye for design and marketing but he really knew what would and wouldn't make sense for the average user, and was able to ward off the engineers and product managers who make so many nonsense decisions like this.


They actually kinda settled into a good grove over the last couple generations. We’ll see if they maintain it.


This has confused me for so long and now that their specs are more similar I’m even more confused.


Especially since most college students need a real computer due to all the fancy software their courses require.


[deleted]


Yup this is what Jobs excelled at. Simplifying the message.


Oh yes of course, my bad. Hard to keep up after all these announcements!


I was thinking of the number of years of support they will get given their different processing power.


I mean the 12.9 inch iPad existed as a product for two generations before the 11 inch


I'm not saying cut models and throw away manufacturing processes. You can take the current models and just rename them in a logical way

The current lineup is...   
- iPad Pro 12.9" (6th Generation)   
- iPad Pro 11" (4th Generation)   
- iPad Air (5th Generation)   
- iPad (10th Generation)   
- iPad (9th Generation)   
- iPad Mini (6th Generation)   

Do you know which of them is best just by looking at the names?  I might as well be comparing a bunch of Dell laptops.  Do you want the Inspiron, Latitude, Precision, or G-Series?  Who the fuck knows.   Is iPad Pro 11" really 2 generations behind the 12.9"?  Is the iPad Air worse than the Mini?  It's confusing as hell

Just rename them like this...   
**2022 iPad Pro Max M2  ($1100)**   
**2022 iPad Pro M2 ($800)**   

**2022 iPad M1  ($600)**   
**2022 iPad  ($450)**    
**2021 iPad ($330)**   

**2021 iPad Mini ($500)**   


Want the Pro version?  Alright, two came out this year with the M2 chip. There is a Max vesion, that must be the bigger screen just like my iPhone 14 Pro Max! 

Want a non Pro version?  Well you have these two 2022 models, those must be the latest, and they are all the same normal screen size.  One of them has the M1 chip, that has to be worse than the M2 Chip used in the pro, so I get why that one is priced more, must be the better model between the two as well.

Want to save some money?  Oh that 2021 iPad at 10.9" is $330, makes sense that it's cheaper than the similar 2022 model.  It's also the same screen size as well.  

Want the smallest screen possible? Well that has to be the 2021 iPad Mini, named just like the iPhone Mini I used to have. Why is it $500?  Well it must be more powerful than the 2022 iPad, but not as powerful as the 2022 iPad M1 based on the price

That naming makes sense to me, aside from the Mini being an old model and more powerful.

Something just breaks my brain when the 5th generation iPad is better than the 10th, 9th, and 6th generations.  It just makes no sense. Drop the generations, label them by year, screen size using Pro and Mini, and start including the Chip Name to differentiate them in terms of power.


I don’t use a cable


They are the same only the air is almost half the weight(at greater manufacturing costs). Which, if you are holding it all day for work, matters. 

Im not sure why this stuff is so difficult to understand.


I agree. The price point is bizarre. I also don’t really know who it is for.


If you need an iPad urgently it is a good option. If you're patient third party sellers routinely better those prices.


> If it was you’d complain even more about the price

Hope she sees this bro


>	If it was you’d complain even more about the price

It’s not like $100 devices have had a laminated screen for nearly a decade or anything


There are plenty of people that will see the new smaller bezel design, the pretty new colors and the “New” next to the name, the low price tag and go “ooh that one” without knowing or caring about the tech specs. You’re underestimating peoples draw to pretty design. People see the bezels on the 9th gen and it reminds them of the old bezels on the cheap/old iPhones and it gives them a bad taste.


> 9th gen iPad

Waited for 10th, pffft. Got the 9th gen yesterday. My needs for it are basic anyhow.


Don’t you guys use iPad minis tho? Like I always hear Med students say they prefer iPad minis for the smaller size


[deleted]


For somebody like a grandparent, the landscape mounted camera is probably the primary and absolute best reason to upgrade - it'll make calls much more natural, like on a laptop, instead of the weird "looking off centre" effect and the "grandma picked it up by the edge and now she's blocking the camera with her thumb" issue, plus that centre stage feature will probably feel a lot more natural when the camera is central.


Then what’s grandma going to get 7 years later when there’s no more 9th generation for sale?


I was holding off for the 10th gen. I pulled the trigger on the 9th gen the day they announced the 10. Paying pretty much double is just absolutely not worth it. 9th gen is the clear choice for a budget model - great value IMO too.


they have the M1 Air, M2 Air, 13" Pro, 14/16" Pro - really just needs to be the M2 Air for $1,099 and the 14/17" Pro starting at $1,999


Macbook lineup is a prime example of this mess. Pro 13” and Pro 14” are different computers even though the name suggests that their only difference is the size. Apple is basically just hacking the pricing structure for maximum profit rather than actually thinking about the naming scheme that makes sense.

On rare occasions I feel it’s justified like with Macbook Air m1 and Air m2, but Macbook Pro 13” and the budget iPad are absolute shitshow imo. They should have either discontinued the 9th generation or not release 10th generation at all, especially with that pencil situation. It’s like they somehow accidentally made the iPad that would kill the Air so they decided to neuter it on purpose.


Its because of Tim Cook the supply guy being in charge, he’s squeezing every bit of money out by increasing prices of new models then keeping outdated ones in the line-up causing this fragmentation


Two iPad classes: regular and pro, and smaller sized versions of each.

-	iPad + iPad Mini for consumers (with exact same specs), and;
-	iPad Pro 12.9” + 11” for professionals/ people who want the most out of a tablet.

It’s not rocket science.


They where selling multiple sizes and feature sets all at the same time.  Like now they had an iPod for every price point. This happens when products become mature. People say it’s confusing but the cheapest iPad has always been the best seller. The costumer for the pro especially knows if it’s the one they want. With a new design there always comes a price bump. This new model is to entice folks away from the 329 model.  It’s weird seeing people who are obviously not the target market think Apple shouldn’t offer more products for non tech enthusiasts or peeing lower incomes. Folks also seem to pretend as if certain products like this one often have more consistent and often aggressive 3rd part retail store discounts. I’m still using a 12.9” 2018 pro that I saved $200 on at the time by getting it at Best Buy


I feel like if they’ve gone to the effort to redesign the whole model for the 10th gen, you’d have thought they could have added a charging magnet to a short edge. This was a deliberate choice.


There isn’t really room on the sides. Charge port, speakers, microphones


I severely doubt they can’t do both. I need to open up a new iPad Pro to confirm the spacing, but the current magnet charging system doesn’t take up enough space to justify that excuse


On the iPad Pro, the Pencil dock and the volume rockers are on the same side. So move FaceID to the other long side, the only thing there is a microphone hole. Just move that up higher or work it into the now new FaceID module.


Of course. Now apply that to a mini.


Mmm! You haven’t really thought that through. Now charge your pencil when the iPad is in your bag. You obviously don’t have a pencil 1.


Even more ridiculous ! (Coming from a iPad pro 2016 w/ pencil one


My thoughts exactly.


It’s actually less complicated than yours


Most of the commentors on this sub thread are acting like Apple doesn’t know what they’re doing. Reddit doesn’t represent the whole consumer base. Is it confusing? Yes. Is it hurting Apple’s sales? Probably not.

Edit: What I see in the lineup (excluding mini because that’s in its own world) are ipads at different price points. And the way they achieve that is with the SoC. iPadGen9-A13, iPadGen10-A14, Air-M1, Pro-M2.
There are other hardware features that contribute, but that seems to be the most straightforward contributor.


[deleted]


Nah, he got you fam


Agreed. The price gouging is slowly getting out of hand. Every year I think to myself well this is even worse than last year. Sad thing is that it seems to work out for them just fine. 

Gonna be interesting how they fare when inflation keeps fucking regular people out of the little spending money they have left.


Then I misunderstood the premise of your comment

I personally only find the iPad lineup confusing, everything else is pretty straight forward. Last time the problem wasn’t the number of products they made or how confusing is the lineup, it was that people didn’t want those products, which is a very different thing


This, this is the sad truth. If you care about build and software quality there just isn’t anything coming close to the level of care that goes into apple products but my god the price gouging is getting unacceptable. They are already sitting on mountains of cash but earnings must grow indefinitely. Apple desperately needs an equal competitor but who’s gonna front the cost it takes to get there


Their products are pretty from the outside but they’re just as poorly made as everything else. Almost every generation of every lineup has ridiculous design flaws. 

Remember the butterfly keyboard? The MacBooks with the poorly designed display cable that tore after opening and closing the laptop for a few months? How about the iPhone 6, 6S and 7 that had components separating from the logic board just from daily wear? 

Sure, they’re pretty compared to other products that cost half as much, but I’m not so sure that the premium alternatives from other companies are as bad as they used to be.


[deleted]


Apple totally should make self lacing shoes with built in accelerometers and whatever other biometrics they can scan in that area.


Which then again is completely different than the iPad Ultra Pro Air Max Plus


I dunno do I look like Tim Apple to you


I agree, my point is the higher ups are likely aware of post like these on Reddit and just don’t care.


I think you have that backwards.


Not same though. Mini has A15...laminated display. Apple pencil 2 support and few other things.


“Fancy software” 

Microsoft office, and a browser. Most college students aren’t studying engineering. Not saying it works for all, but you’d be surprised how far this perception of “iPads can’t  be used for school” goes. It’s not entirely true and dependent on major.


The smaller model existed in the 10.5 inch model for the first two generations if I recall correctly, right? The first one was released after the original 12.9 inch iPad, yes, but it belonged to the same generation. The second generation of both the 10.5 and the 12.9 were released simultaneously. And yeah, the 11 inch was released starting from the third generation of iPad Pro, but it is still the direct successor as the 10.5 iPad Pro, and there was absolutely no need to start counting again from that point on.  
The 12 Pro lineup had larger screens (the Pro went from 5.8 to 6.1 inch, and the Pro Max went from 6.5 to 6.7 inch), and Apple didn’t consider those to be different generations from the non-Pro even though that one had the same screen size as the previous model.


Yeah but it should just be a different size lol


I don't like including the CPU name in the product name and they'd never include the year because it would call attention to how long they've gone since updating (especially with something like the mini that gets updated infrequently). Really, I think the only confusion here is between the iPad (10th gen) and the iPad Air.


I doubt they would ever want to attach a year to a device’s name, because then consumers feel as if they’re getting an inferior product. “Oh, that’s last year’s phone or tablet.”


What? The Air has never been "almost" half the weight of the standard iPad, even less so these days. Even in the year it debuted, the Air was just shy of three quarters the weight of the competing iPad model. There's practically no weight difference between the latest models.

First gen Air (2013): 469g  
Fourth gen iPad (2012): 650g

Fifth gen Air: 461g  
Tenth gen iPad: 477g


BS. My wife has the 2017 regular iPad and I have the Air. It's literally impossible to feel any weight difference.


Sure


-	You’re underestimating peoples draw to pretty design.

Apple likely has the best marketing team in the world, you are absolutely correct. Those colors was chose for a reason.


Can confirm. Using a 10.5” Pro and while it is fully capable and a wonderful iPad, I finally upgraded to have the better design.


I never said it wasn’t the case with regular people. In my comment I was talking only about corporate customers and for them those things would be less of a priority, I would expect price and longevity to be the most important ones


[deleted]


Getting consistency across UIs is a worthwhile reason, as someone who often has to teach older people…


>without a home button to better match her iPhone 12

Just FYI, the new iPad still doesn’t have FaceID, just a touchID button in the side. It might be worth looking at a 2018 refurb iPad Pro.


Go for the last gen iPad Air - it’s a better value than the 10th gen iPad


Consistency of the UI, to me is a valid consideration. When its turn comes round in my upgrade rotation, I plan to get one Face ID model or other. I almost wish I’d gotten the smaller Pro instead of the whatever generation regular that year in the first place, then I wouldn’t be considering an upgrade now.

The Home Bottom Touch ID never seems to work in landscape mode. Side Button Touch ID might be better. Just beware when you’re comparing models, new and old.


The M1 air is so good I'm glad they kept it hah. My recommendation for most people (only major advantage to me is magsafe)


The 13 inch MBP has a very specific niche: getting the latest version of the processor into developers' hands.  If you're not buying them for that purpose, you're probably making a mistake.


Jobs died in 2011. Why are you bringing up a 2018 model and complaining that he started this? He was barely alive to see the iPad come to market.

And iPods were pretty clear in what made them distinct — “iPod mini” was a smaller iPod. “iPod nano” was even smaller. “iPod photo” let you store and view photos. “iPod video” let you store and playback videos. Can’t be any more obvious than that, versus “Air” and “Pro” which are outstandingly nebulous terms, in terms of feature offerings.


this is very far from being a redesign… they’re just taking the ipad air 4/5 shells and putting lesser internals in them


Short edge vs long edge. Which do you think is the beat aide to carry a pencil on. Short? Try it in a mini.


You can’t place magnets right next to cameras. Has nothing to do with space.


Mini does not need the landscape camera. The problem with the larger iPads (now) is they all have keyboard+trackpads that only work in Landscape mode, but a webcam designed for portrait mode.  
The Mini does not have a keyboard+trackpad. And it’s beneficial and easier to use the Mini in Portrait mode due to the smaller screen and size.  
  
On the larger sizes, I think their larger problem with the pencil on top is the Antenna array, and that Qi magnets can’t be too close to the rear cameras.


Why?


I have a pencil 1 and it sucks. it's so inconvenient.


Definitely right about that, but if people who follow every move Apple makes are confused, the average person is probably more confused. I think most people are thinking back to the 90s when the company was kind of rudderless with their product offerings and tried to be all things to all people. The company got back on track when it stopped that. We'll see how it goes. I'm perfectly satisfied with my 9th gen and don't \*really\* care about what happens next but it's still weird to see a company with a reputation for being laser focused act otherwise. But, like you said and I alluded to - Apple must have some kind of evidence that people want this which is why it exists!


If we went by the average Redditor's tastes we'd be using foldable phones and Linux computers.


Reminds me of all the people in the ps5 Reddit sub who complained about the last of us remake being a rip off and how everyone knows better then to buy it. Was the 3 best selling game the month of release and 2 most downloaded on the console lol

> there just isn’t anything coming close to the level of care that goes into apple products

The sad thing is that Apple has begun slipping even there. Everyone's aware of how bad iOS/iPadOS software quality is getting. macOS Ventura is riddled with bugs and it's all been down a slope for the past 2-3 years. Apple needs to regroup— this breakneck "update-every-year-at-all-costs" isn't sustainable and users are suffering as a result


With some exceptions, such as the dreadful butterfly keyboard, I did not see any significant issues with my ownership of these products. I’d say they fail within the typical rates of most hardware. 

In another life (07-14), I worked as a Mac genius. Now all those products I worked on are obsolete, but fwiw; there were only a few known/repeat issues. For the most part, the failures we saw weren’t surprises or out of left field (lot of mechanical hard disks failures; showing my age), unless it was due to a customer causing damage.


That'll be $1999 for Apple Shoes base 64 gb model.


Nope, Google it...


Think of it as the iPad Air Mini.


Microsoft Office sucks on iPad


Nah, not only engineering. All of STEM requires software not available for iPad, whether it’s IDEs for computer science, or Matlab for most science/math things (there’s an iPad app, but it has limitations compared to the desktop versions).


>Really, I think the only confusion here is between the iPad (10th gen) and the iPad Air.

I saw someone else suggest it change to iPad SE and iPad, respectively, which makes a shit-ton of sense to me and would make the folks at Apple obsessed with their pricing ladder happy by shifting the model perceived as default iPad up a price-point.


461/477 = 0.5.
Quick maths


Did you….buy this new iPad? A refurb 2018 iPad Pro 11” is sitting on the Apple site for only $20 more


I will finally be upgrading my 10.5" too. Between the lack of Stage Manager coming to this old model, the battery doesn't last long anymore, and the touch screen getting finicky (Apple already replaced the device once for the same issue, seems like a problem with this model); I'm ready for a new iPad.


You’re part of the problem. Apple is too far into designer products. On another note, I just love my 27” iMac with its super thin… very edge of the screen. The fans sound like it’s going to take off from my desk, but oh is it sexy…


Isn’t the UI the same? Still the same multi tasking menu etc.


But it's more expensive, right?


I can't even get over how much it pissed me of they added it back. That connection could have been a USB-C, which would have been so much more useful.

Instead they have a giant, barely useful, cut in the side.

I assume everybody else loves it or something, but I don't get it.


I clearly said iPods


It’s obvious that they mean redesigned from the 9th generation. Don’t be purposely obtuse


Why do you think?

you obviously don’t have a mini and a pencil.


Really. You don’t use the lightning adaptor. I haven’t stuck mine in the port since pairing  it.


>	if people who follow every move Apple makes are confused

Are they actually confused? Can they actually not figure out which iPad to buy if they’re in the market?


Or are they looking for a higher level cohesion across the product line real consumers don’t care about?


Per shoe.  Inserts are extra.


So it was called the MacMan, but he originally wanted to call it the iMac? Are you from an alternate dimension?

EDIT: also I read the article you linked. You have it backwards.


Yup but it actually serves a section of people like me who do not want that big of a device. I like the form factor of the mini more that the air/pro 11'

And it's not cutting back on things to some extent. Though that could have been better


While that’s true for STEM and highly technical degrees you’d be surprised to find a good amount of degrees are not heavy on the technical requirement side.

[top 10 majors](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/top-ten-college-majors-amp) 

Most of these don’t have major software requirements. Although I agree some do, I don’t believe it represents the majority.


It's 0.5 if you round down to the nearest half. /s


Nah, I bought the new Pro, which isn’t too great either. The only reason I’m getting it is because my work is paying for half of it. If they weren’t, then I probably would’ve waited another year or two until there is a change worth paying for.


I’m fine being part of the problem of why Apple makes beautiful devices.

I’m not a power user - I just enjoy the elegance.


When I say “keeping them the same UI”, I mean the same interface between her the poster’s iPhone 12 and iPad.  If she gets the 9th gen iPad, then one device has a home button, and the other device doesn’t.

I could point out that this also affects other actions that are different (Siri, Control Center, Screen Shots), but it’s really about how to exit apps, and just that.  As someone who works primarily with older adults, many get consistently confounded at trying to remember how to exit apps when it’s different on each device.  I don’t think it’s something that everyone can appreciate, adapting to something so simple seems…well, simple, but it’s not for everyone.  And when we’re talking about a gesture that is one of the primary things to know about using said device…spending the extra money to make it the same gesture to help the user be more happy and less frustrated with their devices is money well spent, IMO.


Gestures are different.

When you trip over your charging cable you will gain understanding


Idk I think it's WAY better to be able to plug in to charge without taking up a USB port which could be used for data. On a laptop which has more space on the chassis than a phone or tablet, I definitely appreciate a dedicated charge port.


ETA

Also, no one said anything about iPods, weirdo.


That thing is tiny as shit I lost it. It's a miracle I haven't also lost the cap yet either.


I said since the beginning that jobs wanted to call that computer "MacMan". I think it should be obvious given the context. I was answering to the guy saying Jobs must be spinning in his grave because of the iPhone XS Max turbo edition with knuckles and from Dante from the devil may cry franchise name. You need to improve your reading comprehension...


You can control home button iPads like the others fyi, the gestures are all the same. The home button just gives you another option.


But the guy buying it for his grandparent literally says she won't be using a Pencil with it, so why bother getting an iPad that has better Pencil support, when you could spend less, and have a newer model with a sensibly placed FaceTime camera for calls to family and friends? I've said it elsewhere in these comments - the relocated FaceTime camera is probably the primary reason a lot of older users will go for this model, as most people do FaceTime calls with the iPad propped up in landscape, so it will feel a lot more natural.


His grandma won’t use the pencil she’ll most likely instead benefit from the new placement of the selfie camera for facetime

He may as well get her the iPad 10 to save money


It’s a difference of US$150 for new models.

I think that’s more than “a little” (it’s more than 25% of the cost of the iPad), but to each their own.

**Edit**: another user has indicated that you were talking about the fourth generation iPad Air.


Even that, you can get MagSafe USBc adapters so you wouldn’t lose the usb if you’d rather use it.


But with a 3rd USB C port, you can also charge it using that port.

It is literally better to use USB C _in every way_, unless you actually need the pull out the cable using magnets feature.


I mentioned Jobs sold multiple skus of iPods weirdo very similar to the current iPhone or iPad lines


Hardly Apple’s fault. Seems it’s. Miracle you haven’t lost the pencil.


That’s not what you said. Go back and read it. I don’t know if English is not your first language or what, but you have it backwards. The order of the words in that sentence completely changes the meaning.


Oh I know that.  But will an 80 year old who is used to a visual prompt (I.e. a button)?

From 4 years of experience since the iPads got rid of the home button?  No.  Hell, I’ve seen kids set up Assistive Touch for their parents or grandparents just because it looks like a button, and these users keep *looking* for one, because there is on another device they use.

Telling someone in that mental position “oh, you can just do this” is not effective.


They’re referring to 4th gen though if one can find them


You should absolutely not buy that.


Apple’s design is properly done to minimize the risk that pins short and blow shit up. That random third party has not tested and validated their design. You’re safer dumping water on your laptop every day.


My guess is there are bandwidth limitations where you couldn’t take MagSafe out and put USB-C in its place without making changes to the M1/M2 chips.

Plus, you can still charge via USB-C if you prefer. It’s not like they *removed* a USB port to make space for MagSafe. MagSafe was added in addition to the existing USB ports.


Their fault for making proprietary shit the size of an atom


>	I’ve seen kids set up Assistive Touch for their parents or grandparents just because it looks like a button, and these users keep looking for one, because there is on another device they use.

Yep. Works in reverse too. I still occasionally forget I need to use a Touch ID and Home Button to open my iPad and I’ll swipe the screen like, “why are you locked?” I got used to Face ID *real* quick.


They probably can't do full bandwidth, but honestly USB-C is way faster than what I need. I just like to be able to plug in an extra screen and a USB stick, in addition to be able to charge the thing.

And while you are technically right they didn't remove a USB-C port, they could have added it instead.


I haven’t lost mine. Or the cap. Or the pencil. It’s so easy to blame someone else for your own carelessness.


The biggest news in iPad since the iPad


Craig could barely contain his laughter. Probably reshot that intro at least once.


Their excuse was always “we want to make the best weather app on iPad” and then they go and basically resize the stock iPhone weather app.


Weather app on iPad but still no calculator?!


They didn’t even bother have Craig making even the smallest quip about its long time absence. Could have at least lead in with a “They said it couldn’t be done…” — must really have been a long time shameful omission for some, internally! 🤣


[deleted]


They’ll literally add anything but a calculator app


It only took 12 years!

Obligatory “can’t innovate, my ass”


STILL NO CALCULATOR APP, WTF APPLE?


They needed that m1 power to make it the best weather experience possible that we're really gonna love


Next CALCULATOR


It must have been very difficult to come up with that layout. I get why it took them this long.


So you're telling me that *all* this time iPad users never had access to a native Weather app on their device? 

h...how?


Dropping a weather app before a calculator app on the iPad is down right criminal at this stage.


Apple in 2030 

“We’re excited to reveal the all new Calculator app for iPad. 

This is the most advanced Calculator app we’ve ever designed and we think you’re gonna love it”


Thank god… it was pure insanity that it took this long. You can have a weather widget just like iPhone but when you tap it it goes… to a website? Glad to finally see it. Now a calculator…


Our long national nightmare finally drawing to an end


Think this was something mkbhd asked about in that one interview he did lol. He must be psyched.


iPad beat the Mac in getting a weather app.. Hopefully they’ll port it to the macOS in the future (or better yet just do it now)


Where’s calculator too damn it!?


Nice, it only took 12 years, but it happened. 

Seeya in another 12 years when they add a calculator.


[deleted]


Those crazy bastards actually did it


YAY!  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉


Calculator?


[deleted]


i hope they allow it on macos too


Could I just get the weather apps to work on car OS please…. And no, I’m not going to crash because there is a freaking map…. What do they think Waze is !


Jesus. Apple is slow with a lot. Lol I adore Apple but dang.


And in five years the iPad will get a native calculator app, lol.


calculator wen


Oh…my…god

After 11 years…it’s finally happening, we did it!


Didn’t they buy dark sky a few years ago? Are they doing anything with that? Was a great weather app


CALCULATOR


Instagram you are on the clock


They said it couldn’t be done!


And still no calculator 💀


This is news?


Innovation, Courage!
/s


Whatever happened with DarkSky integrating with the weather app?


Yay. I’m guessing it’ll be equally as unreliable as the iPhone weather app so I’ll just keep using my WTF forecast app. The only app I’d be excited to see for iPad is the wallet. But I’ll have lost my vision completely and won’t need to worry about it anymore before that happens.


lmao, Apple is a joke latetly


This was the only reason I had carrot.


I can die now


Now if they could just add a calculator…


Next is the calculator app. At least I am hoping!


can’t innovate anymore my ass


i thought once they do it they will do it quietly, didn’t think they will dare to say it out loud


M1 exclusive am I right 

/s


So this is why the iPad air 2 wont be able to run ipados 16


I’m watching the presentation right now. I’m not surprised at all there’s no weather or calculator, these people seem clinically insane.  The fact that the stuff they’re showing you is actually really cool just makes the whole thing weirder.  It would be great to watch on acid


Kind of a bit late. With how bad global warming is, weather apps are as bad a the weather man in the 80s


Please add it to CarPlay


Too bad that the weather forecast in my area sucks so much that I can hardly ever rely on it


CALOCULATOR !


Cries in calculator.


It’s been so overdue.


when is calculator coming?


Wait it wasn’t there??


now, let’s hope apple adds calculator app to ipad in ios 17…


ipad? oh yeah that thing that has been collecting dust in a drawer ;D


Cant believe we are finally celebrating this. I wonder what finally gave?


Really needs calculator.


Man, I really wanted it to be the calculator app


For iOS 30 maybe calculator too?


I am complete.


Now the pressure is on the calculator.


No one talking about the weather kit api that I assume is dark sky. Must mean weather apps can be made without subscriptions.


Health and full Fitness apps, and the Wallet app are what I hope for next.   


and Calculator…


LOL. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽


They should add a calculator finally.


Now the calculator remains!


When calculator?


It's not a M1 exclusive? Right


This is an admission that they were wrong for not having the app for all these years, no?


*and Mac!


***M1 exclusive?*** can't find in the article


At the risk of sounding stupid can ELi5, why weather app is so important? 

I’m from South East Asia, I never seen anyone put up the weather app or talked about it.


What about the calculator app?


About time!


Such a long wait for such an uninspired design. Pure laziness. Why the hell are the icons so tiny?


That only took what?  Over 12 years?


Very excited too see how the weather map looks on this


I hope weather app doesn't need an M1 iPad. I hope my paltry A12Z is good enough.


Seems like the temperature takes up way too much size in landscape… so much that it pushes all the other content beneath “the fold.” It looks sloppy and seems like bad attention to detail.


I hope that, not just for iPadOS but for everyone, the weather maps has higher resolution precipitation data and smoother animations. The current radar map is almost useless.


Now do calculator!


I think I’m going to love it


Wait until we get the calculator


Now give us a calculator


they saved ipadOS for the last part of the show and all we got was a damn weather app

M2 Air is far more exciting


For real. For me it was a waste of space, hardly ever used it. Had so much potential but years later it's still just big iOS with fewer polished apps due to the size


Probably more than once


Its the best iPad weather app they've ever made


Seriously. Reminds me of when they changed today view on iPad from having two columns to just one to bring it to parity with iPhone.


The stock iPhone weather app that was redesigned in iOS 15 with more functionality like radar maps after they acquired Dark Sky, yes.


iPadOS 19


This is mind boggling… many iPad users are students and a calculator is so useful


They have engineers working on this around-the-clock but the technology just isn't there yet. Lots of issues overheating and killing battery life. Probably looking at 2030-2035 for a calculator app


It sucks because I feel like Apple could design a sick advanced calculator with their UI skills.


Need an M2 for that.


Stop being ridiculous; the technology isn't anywhere near ready yet. It will need at least an M4 chip.


Apple: We have a product for that, it’s called iPhone 13, Apple Watch, Mac, and Siri.


It’s just hubris at this point.


Calculator technology just isn't there yet


I don’t have an iPad but have been considering one as an ebook reader and maybe light gaming machine (Civ VI baby). There’s no calculator app on the damn thing?


Ipads screen size would be perfect for a graphing calculator


The iPad is not capable of such things.


The M1 chip can’t handle the calculator. Gotta wait till be have m2 iPads.


That was my first thought too lol


Should I build a calculator into [Weathergraph](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1501958576)? I wondered how to best use the huge screen there :).


I’m salty about it because I just want it in the control center! I don’t want to open an app for it.


Give us calculator you cowards!


Right? He made a joke about the marketing team working really hard to come up with M2, so I mean they're willing to make fun of themselves.


That’s the kind of humor Jobs used to use on stage for moments like these


190*


Calzy can breathe easy for one more year


It's an issue which divides Apple staff


###TECHNOLOGY STATUS: THERE YET


As a developer, I kind of like it when Apple leaves obvious gaps in their software. I wrote WunderMap for iPad back in 2010 and it was pretty popular until The Weather Channel bought and killed it.


[deleted]


Spot light search is better then calculator on iPhones and Macs in my opinion.


I agree that it’s ridiculous. In the mean time: have you tried Tydlig? It’s friggin excellent.


Then phone?


/s


Yeah, it just opens weather.com on safari when we click on the weather widget.


Macs didn’t have it either.


Well most android users i know use dark sky if they want the best weather app and i used carrot and used dark sky as my source but since apple now bought dark sky now the weather app will have the best data


My guess is that there are plenty on the App Store.


What do you consider the advantage of a "native" app to be?

EDIT: bring on the downvotes, but please tell me why you are downvoting, because I'd love to understand why there is all this clamoring for an ipad weather app when there's never, ever been a barrier to getting weather on the ipad (lots of free apps)


Nope, just a widget which opens a web page


I’ve always used Carrot for my weather so I’ve never noticed.


It's the fastest calculator we've ever put into an iPad at Apple


>Mac

[It's coming to the Mac too!](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/macos-ventura-preview/) You can spot it at the very bottom of the page.


How about using weather widgets? or use spotlight? Or google? Or some weather web site? Or third party apps? Why must apple supply you with an app for everything?


And the Clock app too! It's a minor thing but useful to have and removes the cognitive dissonance when I have to remember whether something simple like the clock exists on macOS or not.


You'll have to wait for iOS 20 for that


This sub isn’t one person


Well, it’s true. And you could say that with other apps as well. (Also, “this sub” consists of a bunch of unrelated people who often disagree.)


> Very few new or Pro features

Multi-windowing and proper external monitor support aren't enough for you?


Looks like very soon. I just saw this a few minutes ago.

https://blog.darksky.net/


Don’t get greedy, we should see that somewhere around iPadOS 27


I’ve got the beta on an older iPad and I can confirm this is a feature for all iPads that support iPadOS 16


Probably waiting to give it the spotlight at the iPhone 14 event.


The tech is not there yet


[deleted]


you can do basic calculations in spotlight, but yes still pretty crazy they don't include just a re-imagined macOS calculator app on it with programmer and scientific layouts


Bring Grapher to the iPad.  And a nice full featured calculator.


LOL I yelled the same thing at my TV


I just have a feeling that the “team” behind the calculator for iPad app is like, 3 people who also have 40 other more important things to do, which is why we never see it


We need M69 until we’re have the tech for the calculator. Not in our life time


I agree they should do it out of principle but at this point just get Calzy and be done with it. Best calculator app currently and better than anything Apple would do imo.


Saving that for the iPads 25th anniversary I heard.


Coming in 2025.


It’s their best iPad weather app yet!


Full external monitor support? Stage Manager? Hello? Those are huge.


Completely disagree, I am very excited for the iPadOS updates.


So then why didnt they release it with iPadOS15


And we think you’re going to love it!


That seems way too hopeful.


For landscape calculator we’ll have to wait for iPadOS 20


Spotlight.


Would be cool if they could utilize the iPads screen and create something like a graphic calculator with all the functions of the ti84 (calc, linear algebra, etc. functions). The apps doing this suck.


They haven’t done it for the iPhone though. Their calculator is meh.


Isn’t the iPad supposed to be the device that sits between all of those when it comes to capability and usability? The iPad lacking a calculator looks even worse when you put it this way.


Now you can clip your iphone to the top of your ipad and use it as a calculator using handoff, nothing to plug in


Spotlight search, Numbers etc. etc.


You can download one of many dozens on the app store, but you cannot swipe from the top right and open the calculator like you can on an iPhone.  Apple can't figure out how to do it on a large screen.  Too complicated.


Don't worry man there are many great alternatives on the app store, 50$ a month will get you a somewhat decent non-crappy calculator app. (If you're actually wondering if there's an app, Calculi is great. Good integration with ipadOS, good UI, keyboard shortcuts etc.)


> ^5 Do not eat iPod Shuffle


Yeah but I think they see how genuinely stupid and frustrating it is that they’ve not had a weather app for so long.


PCalc forever. The only calculator with an AR racing game.


And continues to leave customers nonplussed


I understand the comedy of not having the calculator, but is there like really a huge reason why people want it so badly?

Edit. Jesus Christ man talk about touchy……simple questions don’t go over well here.

Also sorry people have no other ways to do basic math.


Don’t get your hopes up


Somebody always brings this up and I will always disagree. The spotlight search using the keyboard is not as fast or usable as an actual calculator app. You can’t use it easily for multiple functions in a row, like sequential calculations. The tried and true calculator layout is much faster than having to use a keyboard. Things such as exponents require additional key presses. It’s not a functional replacement any more than pulling up Google on safari to enter your calculation there would be.

Spotlight exists in iPhones as well, but we all still use the calculator app there. It’s because the calculator app is better.


It's better for really quick calculations but worse if you're doing a lot of calculations back-to-back.

I actually had forgotten macOS has a calculator app lol. I only use spotlight.


doesn't work if you are trying to multitask with the calculator on the side


You mean it opens "please disable your adblocker" on Safari?


that's absolutely insane to me


Macs are computers though


They do as of Ventura, though.


personally I've been using Foreca since last year. Very clean, very simple, great widgets and notifications


Siri won’t open Carrot if I ask her the weather and her default go-to, Weather.com, is a bit of a mess even with adblockers


well for one - not having to rely on the app store to get such information and have it included out of the box. Especially if said app can support many/most reliable forecast providers like accuweather or foreca


The Dark Sky rain forecast I find to be significantly more accurate that other services.


Apple own an iPad weather app - Dark Sky, which will be shut down end of year. Thankfully being replaced by a native app. All the other weather apps in the App Store that I’ve tried beg for subscriptions. Was happy to pay the once off fee for Dark Sky, but now that it’s closing, I’m glad Apple have a new app that won’t nag me.


> there's never, ever been a barrier to getting weather on the 

That's a bad argument.  That's like "Why does anyone want a Mac or an iPad?  You can just buy a Windows PC or a Microsoft Surface, there's plenty of these available on store shelves."


Great news!! Perhaps it’s time to reconsider the Carrot subscription haha


>	[Tap forecast modules...](https://i.imgur.com/D0Duza8.jpg)

Touchscreen Macs confrimed??!? ^^^^/s


Or how about apple ports their app across the the entire ecosystem because that’s what users expect. 

Especially when they use the same silicon and the same programming languages. 

Stop sticking up for lazy trillion dollar companies.


Oh it was merely an observation, I use Carrot on everything and wolfram alpha for a calculator so this doesn’t affect me at all lol


Well other apps have a subscription model, apple don't have it.


It’s like this, “ I don’t like the usb c port, I prefer the lightning port because it’s smaller”. 

There are some who agree with this and a lot who downvote it.


Its funny how Apple finally added a multitasking feature that works across devices and no one bats an eye.

People really only wanna complain to complain


Thanks. It seems that they are using DS's hyperlocal forecasting now. "Dark Sky's forecast technology is now enhanced and integrated into the all-new Apple Weather forecast." 

But, the API is very different. And, my current temperature is 1 degree different than that in DarkSky. I turned on location services and notifications for the Weather app and will check this next time there rain is forecast and see if they both give the same alert.


Thanks for confirming. I was being sarcastic and not even good at it lol


We'll probably have to wait for the M3 processor honestly. Calculator seems like a big task that I'm not sure even the M2 can handle.


You trigger me by using the term “*spotlight*”.

Your post should come with a warning.


I’d say they won’t release it at all. It’s been how many years since the iPad has been originally released and we’ve been asking for a calculator app with our software updates?


I think iPhone before the 3G had one innovation I care most about: glass display. It was so unintuitive.  Glad they did it though.


I have a feeling the intern wrote the calculator app, and every year someone is forced begrudgingly to barely keep it functional.


Can't innovate anymore *my ass*.


*Only for M1


Lol, the entire discussion on iPads on this sub is driven by mac users who don't like or even want iPads. Everything is gonna be a disappointment to them.


Yeah. These are game changers for iPad. It can be used docked now like a MacBook Air.


those were great, sure. but nothing compared to the macOS and M2 hardware. 

The point is they saved the last spot for it


Same reason why App Library took a year to come to iPad I guess.


With completely reimagined numbers and symbols!


It takes courage


[deleted]


What more do you need out of it? If you need to do anything more than the basics on the regular, odds are you already have a dedicated calculator. Plus there’s plenty of options on the App Store already.


A spreadsheets app for simple calculations?


[deleted]


It’s been awhile, but when i last looked for a free calculator app they all had annoying ads. An apple first party app would not have ads. Simple


Did you really just ask why someone would use a computer to do math?


This. The technology is still a decade away, maybe more.


Can someone make an undetectable ad blocker please? I don’t mind wasting bandwidth just don’t display them.


Yes, it is


What’s a computer?


I heard that they will close the dark sky API end of this year to all 3rd party apps? Like i guess it depends some peoples jobs really depend on the weather being correct even if its hours off which he has to deal with so he said dark sky was a the best for roofing and stuff and solar panels as well as guttering etc house stuff he does lol


How do you like that is there an iPhone App Store version i might check it out!


Isn't that more of a shortcoming of Siri, and nothing to do with the weather app?


> not having to rely on the app store to get such information 

okay so the advantage is that its pre-installed, saving you roughly 45 seconds, once? 

>Especially if said app can support many/most reliable forecast providers like accuweather or foreca

But theyre not doing that? Darksky sources the data from NWS and then makes their own forecasts.


Apple bought Dark Sky about 2 years ago and this is the fruit of that purchase. I just wish they’d buy a an old TI-86 or even a Casio calculator and turn it into an app…


Well, this is resolved by an API for this data being being available and not really to do with the fact that there's a native app.


They nag you for subscriptions because it costs a shit ton of money to either collect weather data or to use someone else’s rather data. So again this is not an advantage has nothing to do with the app being native and everything to do with Apple being big enough to not care about the hit they are taking on having to get that weather data.


Thats not the same thing at all, because there objective pros and cons to both platforms (and neither windows devices or Macs are free). The thing that people want is a FREE and AD-FREE weather app. This is not inherent to it being a native app. And I have yet to hear what the inherent advantage of a native app is over any other. Apple happens to make features in most native apps free (although there are plenty of features of native apps that you can pay for, such as Apple Music, Apple Fitness, more storage on iCloud Drive, etc). Its fine to want something for free, but people seem to not be able to look past the fact that they want something for free and this has nothing to do with the app being native.


Right. And by that logic final cut and Xcode should be on iPhone?


Sarcasm is difficult to convey on the internet, no problem though


Yeah, calculators used to take up whole rooms back in the day. You just can't expect it to fit in a tablet without requiring all the systems resources.


Get ready for an unlabelled orange bar chart that isn't actually quantifying anything

Title: Calculator App

Bar 1:  M2

Bar 2:  M3

[Insert canned enthusiasm from Tim Cook]


Too ambitious, I’d say they wait till the M4.


Glass display?


I’m dying with this thread.


Hard agree. They seem to imagine there it’s likely the majority of users fully appreciate and enjoy the iPad as it is *today* and every enhancement is simply extra icing on a very good cake.


Still wish they just gave us a MacOS mode on there though.


M2 is the one that has nothing special about it. Nice but just natural evolution performance going up. All M1 chips are better than the M2 except for the basic one. So I’m not sure what’s so exciting about.


As someone who primarily uses an iPad, that’s pretty big news. I have a Mac Mini, but the iPad slowly becoming more versatile is easily one of the biggest highlights for the entire keynote for me.


The new M29 chip can process calculations in approximately 0.0000000000028 seconds!


Roman numerals and Arabic Numerals- Wow !!


They’re alright, but they’re still mostly not calculators, and more like solvers. Especially Photomath it kinda sucks.


Come on man, you can create a shortcut for that.


Dammit Tim we're engineers not miracle workers


It’s an iPad with extra steps.


a stupidly expensive toy


It's an iPad with a productivity OS


yes, and I’m okay with them fixing it this way


> okay so the advantage is that its pre-installed, saving you roughly 45 seconds, once?

no, it saves time every time I need to refer to a weather forecast as opening an app is quicker than browsing to a (local) service website, plus notifications, plus the benefit of other new system features, plus it's more user-friendly


It’s pretty cool that they didn’t quite end up fully killing the dark sky api [after all](https://9to5google.com/2022/06/06/apple-weatherkit-dark-sky-android/amp/)


Yeah that’s why I want a native one, so I don’t have to pay.


I'd be down for that...


Yes please


It needs 1TB storage because it's actually just a giant lookup table instead of a calculator


[deleted]


Yeah remember how windows mobile tm like the htc forgot it's name had a plastic display and a stupid stylus?


Pls I beg


Still can't believe they didn't add multi-monitor support for M2...


Yep. And next year at this time? M3! Woa, who could have guessed it‽


I think there will be a m2 pro max and ultra with time.


Faster than on any iPad previously…


“It’s the circle of life”


So then an iPad doesn’t need a weather app? Can’t have it both ways…


An iPad but good*


>  opening an app is quicker 

Do 3rd party apps open slower or something? 

>plus notifications

3rd party apps can't do notifications? 

>plus the benefit of other new system features,

Which ones? 

>it's more user-friendly

What is? Aren't we just talking about opening an app here?


Thanks for the link, when they announced weatherkit I totally thought it would be free, which would be awesome. but half a million free calls aint bad either.


Your phone comes with several apps that are native but have subscriptions to pay for: Apple Music, News, fitness, etc.

You don’t want a native app, you want one you don’t have to pay for. The two things are not related.


No, for real, the science behind the calculator scale has a whole law around it, posited by [computer science pioneer Nathan Poe.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law)


In case this is a serious reply, fyi modern processors are constantly running billions or even trillions of math operations per second, many of which are far, far more complicated than anything you’d put into a simple calculator app.

You can make a calculator with the same functionality as the iPhone calculator app on a breadboard, with off the shelf parts and no traditional “processor” at all. A calculator is actually a common thing to build as like a computer engineering 101 course for students….Basic math is at the heart of all computing.


Uh, try 2 years


Never! M4 all the way, or they get branding issues with M3 :PP


Well, of course. But those weren’t mentioned in this presentation.


please stop being obtuse on purpose


I paid for Dark Sky, I just don’t like having a subscription for every app that does basic functionality. 
Weather is a basic utility that you expect to come on your phone. It’s not the same as a streaming service.
Apple News didn’t come with my phone.


[deleted]


Uh oh, I waited a couple months to buy the new laptop; I better wait until they put out the M5 otherwise I’ll have too much FOMO if I buy a M4 right now…


Perhaps apple too is constrained in what they can make for now


I'm not, and I'm sorry you think that just because your opinion has no substance.

Like literally anything specific and maybe you'll have a point, but so far you haven't said anything that actually explains what makes a "native" weather app better.


Again: you want a free app weather app. That’s fine. But is not related to it being native. I’m asking why people want a native app


/r/woooosh


Even if they could, why would they make them when they literally released the Pro, Ultra and Max versions 6 months and 2 months ago, respectively?


If it's not painfully obvious as to how stupid it is that something as essential as a weather forecast source doesn't have a native app then I don't know what else to tell you


I think by "native" people mean a binary app targeting ipadOS rather than a progressive web app or a link to a web page. 
By "native" they dont mean app written by Apple.

I think this difference is why people arent getting your argument. 3rd party weather apps should be just fine instead of waiting for an Apple authored app


Shh


It must not be that stupid if you can't expound on a single reason why its stupid lol. I solved this problem long ago by installing a 3rd party weather app.


> I think by "native" people mean a binary app targeting ipadOS rather than a progressive web app or a link to a web page. By "native" they dont mean app written by Apple.

They definitely do. People just don't know what they want. No one has described to me an advantage that relates to it being a native app. Every comment basically boils down to people wanting a free and ad-free weather app. Of course, there is nothing wrong with wanting that, but I think people are frustrated with ad filled weather apps and are confusing being "native" with being "free"


not at least enabling people to journal on their iPad, their only device with pen input, seems incredibly stupid.


lul

prob will take them 7+ years to port it to iPadOS/MacOS just like Health for iPadOS


I do journaling every now and then and I do it exclusively on my iPad. Such a stupid decision.


A journaling app…doesn’t support…an iPad… I honestly can’t believe how much Apple clearly doesn’t care about the iPad. iPhones and Macs are receiving updates with lots of features and iPad just gets last years iOS features. I could maybe understand no Mac support, but no iPad support is wild.


That’s stupid. I hate typing on my iPhone. I’m doing it now only cuz I’m at work and my iPad is at home but I’m not thrilled about it. I was really looking forward to it but I guess I’ll keep using the Notes app


I’d love to be able to start a little entry on my iPhone after work or wherever, then pop on my Mac and expand on it in more of a long form entry when I’m home, or even the morning after once I’ve had time to sleep and reflect on the previous day, even my iPad with my Apple Pencil to jot down my thoughts.

Apple is usually pretty fantastic when it comes to syncing and having everything uniform within its ecosystem, really beautifully done more often than not, Journalling would be great for that, yet they’ve simply skipped that part here.

It’s a little disappointing that we’ll prob have to wait until next year at the earliest for iPad and Mac versions. 

Journal really seems like one of those apps that should be on all devices for at least the purpose I mentioned above surely?


It’s a pass for me then. Staring at a small screen with auto correct to write a paragraph a day = nah


It’s the perfect app for the iPad, are you for real Apple?


Yeah because typing on a phone is bliss. WTF.


I actually like the journal app. I’ve tried Day One and while it’s definitely more fleshed out, I’ve realized that I just don’t really care about most of the added things like what the weather was at the time I wrote an entry or word counts.

I’m just going to use this app to write a couple sentences about each day, essentially summarizing it. It’s a perfect app to do that without so much bloat and subscriptions.

I think a lot of people who dislike it are trying to use it to write entire novels for each day and make a scrapbook or something. That’s not what this is.

The only features I’d like to be added, hopefully in the future betas:

- Make the date of an entry more prominent in the UI (maybe at the top instead of the bottom)
- Add widgets
- Add search


SwiftUI was supposed to make targeting the different form factors with one codebase easy. It is not encouraging if not even Apple can do it.


So silly not to target iPad


Hey Apple, if I, as a single person developer, can write a 3D game in c++ from scratch that runs on Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows, Linux, and webgl, I think you can make a journaling app that runs on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.


This isn’t something that I would ever use on any device, but the feature inconsistencies between devices and OS versions has become a real nuisance.


Just Apple being Apple.


Remember that time apple told us the convergence of ARM hardware would allow devs to make universal binaries so they could build 1 app, and it can be used on Mac, iPad and iOS? 

Maybe they should eat their own food.


Sweet, Snse has Apple beat (in that it runs on iOS, iPadOS and macOS)


I’m going to assume that they want to make it _right_, instead of making it _quickly_. 

There are a LOT more people using an iPhone daily compared to using an iPad, makes sense for it to appear there first. 

The Health app only recently appeared on the iPad, so I feel safe in the assumption that the Journal app will just take a while to bake


 PSA: Apple’s new Journal app won’t be available on iPad and Mac **at launch**

This means Journal will be avialable in soon after.


There is stupid. And then there is Apple stupid where one of the largest tech companies puts out a product which is intriguing but flawed with an obvious omission or error.


At this point, you’d be better off using Notes.


Kind of clickbaity.

“There are some code leftovers that suggest Apple has been developing iPad and Mac versions of the Journal app, but it all seems quite experimental and unlikely to be ready in time for the release of iPadOS 17.2 and macOS 14.2 in the coming months. If I had to make a guess, I’d say that Apple will hold the iPad and Mac versions for iPadOS 18 and macOS 15.”

It looks like they’re working on it, but it’s not on the beta of 17.2. It might take a bit, but there’s nothing that suggests that it will never be on either.


Dear journal, it’s me Doug


It says in the actual title at launch calm the fuck down.


Cries in missing calculator


Not sure why everyone is so shocked. Apple is well known for trickling in new/old features so that they have something to announce each year


I really don't like this trend of intentionally kneecapping more capable devices (like computers/tablets) in order to push phones.


... at launch.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But then, we can't even get a basic fcking calculator on iPad, so...


Even the iOS app is too basic at this point it includes none of the features that made this app the talk of the town when they were announced at the WWDC.


As silly as it is that it's not coming out to the iPad or Mac (at least not first).... Most of the complaints are about something that didn't exist a few weeks ago.


this is annoying for many reasons but i will say, with an iphone 15 pro it’ll be nice to just hook it up to my usb-c monitor and use my bluetooth keyboard to write in the journal. 

but i realize that’s not a common use case and it really should be on other devices.


Even though reminders always had Mac and iPad apps, it was not usable for me until last year and very usable this year with sections now. I expect Apple journal to be very basic in features for a long time and iPad and Mac apps at least a year out if not longer with a new iOS update


Like where do they get off not making iPad and Mac versions of this app? 

They encourage and expect independent developers to do this but somehow the most valuable company in the world can't afford to pay a team of first party developers to build this and have it ready for simultaneous launch? 

Pathetic.


Mac I get I guess, but not on ipad??


Imagine journaling on the device I already do all of my journaling on.

Like, Apple, for real, if anything this should’ve STARTED as an iPad app.


Any understand why they didn’t just acquire “Day One”. 

Built in user and subscriber base who already purchase upgrades, cross platform. Industry leading.  

Could have easily done that.


Here I was thinking that this app would compete with GoodNotes, Noteful and even Notion


Why would you want to journal on a device that looks like a journal and has an actual pen you can use on it. /s


On the risk of sounding ignorant, what was the journal app again? I still don't get it's novelty. It felt like fancy notetaking to me.


Still can't use a Wacom with Freeform on MacOS either...

trillion dollar company y'all


Everybody chill, it’s gonna be there next year. It’s like you all were born yesterday sometimes.


“. . . Apple’s Journal app won’t be available on iPad and Mac *at launch*.” Let’s read more of the *speculative* article than just the title.


Universal Clipboard. Type it out on your iPad and copy, then paste through iPhone to journaling app


Same thing with the classical music app. Wonder if the Vision Pro is taking up a lot of resources


Yeah, its weird to not have the app on iPad where you can write directly with a pen, but after reading how it will work using AI, I get why will be only on iPhones. The iPad isn't as portable as the iPhone. You take your phone everywhere, you take pictures with it, listen to music... and that is what the Journal will see and recommend you to write it. I think it wants to approach journaling to those who aren't used to do it. You don't have your iPad on your pocket so it doesnt know where you went, neither you use it to take pictures... so having the Journal app on the iPad wouldnt recommend you to write almost anything. But even that, I hope they release it someday to be able to write with the pencil.


I get not having it on the Mac (not really, but sort of), but not having it on the iPad right out of the gate seems kind of dumb unless they just couldn't get it ready and working the way they wanted (which seems odd given the code base is so similar to iPhone).  Yes, most people that have an iPad also have an iPhone but one of the reasons a lot of people have an iPad is *so they can more easily write*.


Apple has armies of software devs and they can't be bothered? I had no plans to use it because it's as useless to me as Freeform and almost all their native apps, but if I were, journaling on my phone is THE worst possible device out of my iPhone, iPad or Mac. Smh


People saying it’s going to kill DayOne… but where the Apple Journal memories are getting stored ?

We’ll have to extend storage with ICloud+ right?


That’s….. really stupid.
Personally, if I journaled (and owned an iPad for that matter) I’d defo do it more on an iPad than my iPhone.
Heck, even a Mac. It’d arguably be easier to type on


Well, I have the Day One app, and I was planning on sticking with Day One anyway. But this decision to withold the Journal app from iPads seems incredibly stupid. I don’t understand why Apple withholds apps or features that the iPad could clearly handle. There is nothing from a technilogical perspective that would prevent the Journal app from being on the iPad. I saw a Beta tester post that the Journal app right now is very basic. That tells me the iPad could handle it. So why the decision to withold it from iPads?


Of course. I just installed Gboard on my iPad tonight so I could have a swipe keyboard.


I honestly wanted to like this. I've slowly been phasing out third-party apps because Apple's stock apps are getting close to if not better than the third-party apps I use, but there's no way this even competes with Day One in its current form:

* No multiple journals, not even tags.
* Only on the phone, no Mac or iPad app.
* There's actual placeholder text displaying in some of the recommended prompts I've gotten.

This honestly may be one of the most embarrassing app launches Apple's done in recent years. I just keep asking myself why did they even release this? Even for a developer beta, it's bad.


It does not really matter much. You can do it all with the Freeform app and there are a ton of journaling  apps in the App Stores.


Get obsidian. Free, Open Source, Offline, Locally stored. You can store your files on the cloud if you want to sync across devices. Excalidraw lets you do white boards.   

The best note taking/journal programs you can get.   
https://obsidian.md/download


I’ve had it for a couple days and it’s honestly kind of a waste.


This app is useless anyway, can Apple rewrite Xcode from the ground up ?


Oh no, what am I gonna do? I guess I’ll go back to my pad and….hahahahaha LOL who still journals?


Only on the Apple Watch, eh?


Given the quality of writing features in Apple's native apps, I personally couldn't care less. I'd stick to a journal format in Goodnotes or something similar, and spend the extra time required to add images etc.


It’s possible it’ll come in a later iPadOS 17 beta, so I wouldn’t freak out too much. At the same time, I wouldn’t be surprised if they just push it to iPadOS 18 given Apple’s track record


Yet. iPad this year max next. We know the drill by now


Still waiting for Apple Classical to appear on iPad and Mac.


It’ll be available with iPadOS 18. iPads have been a year behind iPhones for a lot of new features for some reason.


Mac is understandable but not including iPad is dumb as hell


It’s a dumb decision, but this is not news. We’ve known this since Ios17 was first announced in the summer.


u/favicondotico, have you considered joining a tabloid newspaper? By removing the words "at launch" from this title, you're a clickbait star.


Yeah I don’t even know why I was expecting a full featured app. This is what they do they give bare minimum and update it over 5 years till it becomes useful till then we gotta wait. 

Sort of like seeing my bare bones Apple Watch data from 2015


This is stupid. Even if it comes later, not being available at launch just feels like the product came out too early.

I journal on my iPad, Mac and windows PC. I rarely journal on my iPhone even if it’s an option for me.


Things that don’t make sense for 200$


It will be an innovation for next years iPad and Mac OS


Honestly I see this is a a missed opportunity


L


Because of course it won't be. Always limiting things as usual.🙄


Okay, then it'll be another dustbin Apple app.

They're getting as bad as Microsoft, making little tools that no one asked for, splintering them into various versions so they don't work everywhere, and then abandoning them.


Apple has been odd on what it makes iPhone exclusive so this wouldn't exactly be a surprise.


I was excited about their Journal app because I don’t really like the options out there, especially that they charge a subscription, but I downloaded the Journal app and it kinda sucks. I don’t think I’ll be using it.


Well, that sucks.


Why Bubba, Why!?


I’m sure with iPad is 18 it will be


Yeah I won't be using it then.


Agreed, but like the article states, there are traces of both an iPad and a MacOS app in the code. So it’ll come. It’s going to gather photos and other data from your phone, etc. automatically, so it’s not so silly to start on phone if apps for the other platforms aren’t ready yet. It’s not meant as a daily journal to write long stories in, but even then phone is natural because that’s what most people are carrying.

The most silly thing to me would be if they waited until iPadOS 18 to release it.


They're still trying to find a way to only make it work with an Apple Pencil 3/4 lol


“Our journal app has been a huge hit and we know you love it on iPhone! That’s why with iOS 20, we’re expanding on its capabilities and bringing the journal app to the new iPad Air Max pro AI plus elite.”


Dont worry, it will be the main feature of ipadOS 18…


I was genuinely excited about sitting down on my iPad and using this application.  I’m dumbfounded I have to journal on my smallest screen.  With my eyes I can barely see the screen and have zero desire journal on something so small.


seriously, why do they hate the iPad so much when it comes to supporting it.


Almost as stupid as not letting us have a native calculator for the last 13 years.


typical apple, never seeing the full picture.


It’s 2023 and the iPad still doesn’t have a native calculator.


Or with an attachable keyboard. I probably don’t want to journal everything with just my thumbs


Apple releases always new features step by step, because of quality reasons. They want to see first in a smaller version and on less devices, how it operates and how users will use it and if there could be some bigger security issues, then a bigger update will come, and later it will be open to use for third parties.


Yeah! Like if only they had the resources of a $2 trillion company or something!


It’ll come.

Right now it’s barebones anyways. They’ll expand and it’ll come to the other later


Or never, like the calculator app for iPad.


Health data isn’t collected on Mac or iPad, so it makes a lot less sense for those apps to exist. Journal on the other hand makes plenty of sense being Mac and iPad apps.


What app do you currently use? I was thinking of getting into journaling and was waiting for this app, but not being able to use my Mac or iPad ruins it


I was excited for this on iPad. Just like you, I journal here and there. I use Goodnotes.


The iPad’s biggest weakness has been its OS. To this day. Hardware always very solid, albeit “fragmented” with a ridiculous 3 pencil and connected keyboard ecosystem… but more or less solid.


Clearly there is something cooking in the background for years now related to iPads, and thats why the neglect, its like thermal issues on latest intel macs before m1 dropped, they didnt care because they knew its going to change. We just don't know yet what it will be, but I personaly guess ipads will be axed and merged with macs, basically you would get an ipad pro but it would be running mac os, and be called a mac.


Getting new (basic) features takes forever. And getting bugfixes for common problems often take years.

So either Apple are too greedy/cheap to hire more people. Or the software dev teams lack competence.


it’ll come in a few months or at least when the next major version of iPadOS or macOS drops.

don’t forget it’s still in beta iOS, be a lil more hopeful.


No Mac support makes this a pointless app for me. I don’t like typing on my iPhone much, especially if I’m trying to type a journal entry. I was holding off getting day one for this so I can use this to make entries on my Mac, but still have it on my phone, I’ve been using the notes app, but it’s limited. They should wait until the app is ready for iPad, Mac and iOS, but it is what it is.


It took them forever to make the lock screen feel like something other than a large iPhone. It’s crazy how underdeveloped the software feels.


I honestly prefer typing on iPad the least


[deleted]


You hit on the head what use case Apple is fulfilling. Most people here want Notes/Evernote/OneNote. That's not what this is intended to be and the location specific features and photos is what makes it good for iPhone and not for iPad or MacOS, at least not without additional work or early user feedback/research on how people are using the app on iOS.


It reminds me way back in the day when Carbon was promoted as a relatively easy transition. Then by the Intel transition they were admitting how long and difficult it actually was.


They are waiting for the liquid cooling feature. The M2 chip isn’t efficient enough yet. Journal app is very resource heavy. /s


I thought iPhone apps can run on iPad if the app developer (Apple in this case) set some configuration. 

Either way, I'm pretty sure Apple just doesn't want the iPad to have Journal for business reasons, not technical reasons.


How do you do rendering? WebGL is equivalent to GL ES 3 which is incredibly limiting.


Soon™


Just because it’s how they’ve operated before doesn’t mean that’s a good thing. Wasn’t Freeform released on everything at the same time?

In the era of Catalyst apps there’s no excuse for this beyond laziness.


No calculator on the iPad is a Steve thing, so respect it and go buy a $5 Casio.


[deleted]


Notetaking and journaling are different. The point is it gives you some prompts to reflect on your day (or you can write whatever you want).


I think it's pretty clear it won't. Even when it was announced during the keynote, they said it was for iOS and made no mention of mac/iPadOS


> journaling on my phone is THE worst possible device out of my iPhone, iPad or Mac

Sure, because you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac.  Younger generations might just have an iPhone.  I suspect that is the target audience.


If you switch to the floating keyboard on your iPad, you already had a swipe keyboard 👍

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210758


Exactly. I don’t understand why people even bother with Apple’s stock apps. There is always a better 3rd party solution available. (Now if only Apple allowed those 3rd party apps to integrate as well as their own…)


What's Xcode got to do with anything?

Also, Xcode is big and has a legacy codebase that predates the web. Literally. Can Apple rewrite it from the ground up? Sure. Should they? Nobody who uses it for a living wants that.


At this point, making late features on iPadOS 18 is cheap marketing for iPad lol sadly


The technology just isn’t there yet!


Of course they’re gonna release it in the next iPadOS version or later. That’s the trend with Apple these days


You know Apple is going to wait til 18. They have been doing this model for years where features or apps only launch on iOS and then next year they make a big deal when it comes to iPad. For example standby is most certainly coming to iPad.


It would be great if these devices from the same company could share photos and app data between each other, maybe even across the internet. 

This type of thing is exactly what ‘the ecosystem’ is good for. Many people who journal do it in a full page format at the end of the day, not in bits throughout the day. It would have been an amazing demonstration for iPad/Apple Pencil. 

Apple yet again on a delayed feature update, and it comes half baked. How many features each year are starting to ‘come this Fall’. It’s getting embarrassing. 

I guess the Day One and other journal app developers will be happy.


It is fucking inexplicable for the only 3 trillion dollar company on the face of the planet to be unable to launch a *journalling* app on the iPad at the same time as the iPhone. It's borderline comedic. You could probably gather some hobby devs from this thread and ask them to do it in a week or two at most. It's basically a dressed up notes app. I mean Jesus Christ Apple what is going on?

One of the things I miss the most about the Steve Jobs era is I feel like he really stuck to the mantra of only selling things you're proud of and only pushing products you actually care about. Nothing felt half-baked. But so much of the Apple ecosystem feels half-baked these days. Why did it take over half a decade to get a Health app on the iPad? That's not acceptable. Why is HomeKit Secure Video so slow and laggy? It has had the same bugs for 3 years.  And they're just expanding their product lines more and more, adding more ridiculous shit.

It's all to appease the shareholders and create more value but I still feel like Steve Jobs would have put a stop to this horse shit. Apple needs their Daddy to come home from work and say, no Timmy, you can only have 3 iPads, and 1 pencil. Stop making this too complicated.


> if they waited until iPadOS 18

Agree. Waiting that long *would* be silly. But hopefully that won’t happen. The iOS and iPadOS guys seem to roughly back on the same page as far as universal features now. No clue how long it would take this to show up on Mac though.


Just like the calculator, there will be better alternatives by the time it’s released lol


Not happening.

Air Max is trademarked.


you know you can just journal using a different app on your ipad, right? you don’t need to wait for apple to tell you it’s ok.


Hey, have you heard we can favorite a playlist now!


You can use spotlight. I also never use the native calculator on my mac. When I work and I have a lot to calculate, I will use my iPhone like a normal calculator. 

That's what Apple also had in mind.


[deleted]


Using Google Keep for the last 5+ years. Simply because it's free and available across platforms.


I really like Obsidian.md. Host the journal on your iCloud account and can access it across all your devices.


DayOne is a good app if you want something that's actually dedicated to journalling. It's been around for over a decade and has apps on all platforms.


It's not a journal-specific app, but I use GoodNotes because sometimes I want to type and sometimes I want to write on my iPad with my pencil. GoodNotes supports both, and doesn't try to convert my handwriting to typed font.


Hardware is always so overcooked. An M2 chip in a tablet is incredible, but redundant. I have an M1 Pro and I cannot see why I’d upgrade at least for another 5 years or so (unless there is a huge advancement in screen tech)
There is so much power then but you’ll never use it because of the OS. I love my IPad, use it every day and it’s great for reading and watching content. But other than that, there’s not much more I can do with it. 

The iPad Pro is so so good, promotion display, amazing screen and battery life, great size. Just not much I can really do with it to improve my workflow.


Seriously. Now that the rumored 12in MacBook is coming back it seems even more silly that my M2 iPad Pro can’t run MacOS or something close to it. If I could run desktop applications like Sketch on my iPad I would never bring my MacBook anywhere.


Not a chance iPads will get “axed”.


My theory is that Apple, at some point, had a clear(er) vision for iPad development but once Vision Pro development began, they shifted resources to that. And now the iPad seems kinda directionless. 

And I know that many people theorize that Apple intends (or intended) to put macOS on iPad. But I disagree. I don’t think Apple would have put in all the work to build out iPadOS in all the ways they did if they intended to scrap it all and out macOS on it later (mouse support, external display support, multitasking, etc.). 

Instead I believe that Apple intends to build out iOS/iPadOS into a full desktop operating system and eventually make that available on your iPhone. Basically Samsung Dex but more functional. The iPad is almost there. 

Many people say this wouldn’t make sense because Apple would cannibalize Mac sales by doing this. But it actually has a couple advantages. iOS brings in App Store revenue unlike a Mac. And also we can’t assume that every customer currently has an iPhone and a Mac. Lots of people have an iPhone and a garbage $400 windows laptop. So it wouldn’t cannibalize a Mac sale in that case.


Lol. Have you ever tried using a desktop Windows app on a Windows tablet touchscreen? Obviously not or you wouldn't have written that.

The problem isn't getting the OS to run on the same hardware in a different form factor. The problem is decades of software written for keyboard/mouse and pixel-accuracy when touchscreens are for big fat fingers.


I dunno man. It took 12 years to get a weather app and the clock is still ticking for a calculator app


It’s a major feature that again is coming late to iPad is the point. I’ve no doubt it’ll come later, it just shows a pattern of behaviour showing how the iPad again is being left behind. Mac is at least getting good hardware and software support.

OneNote and the Notes app just aren’t designed for Journaling


Tried the one note journaling but just feels like a chore honestly.


>I thought iPhone apps can run on iPad if the app developer (Apple in this case) set some configuration.

Generally they can, if the developer builds it as an iPad app. Likewise, an Apple Silicon based Mac could also run an iPhone or iPad app if the developer deems it appropriate. One problem with this is user interface changes are often required to make the app more optimal on a different platform and failing to do may result in a bad user experience on some platforms. Personally I'm inclined to believe this is likely to be the reason for the journaling app, but I still find it less than acceptable as Apple should have the expertise in house to work thru these issues throughout the development process.

&#x200B;

>Either way, I'm pretty sure Apple just doesn't want the iPad to have Journal for business reasons, not technical reasons.

IMO that would be rather sad for Apple's customer base.


It's really not that hard.

\*points at Notes app\*

Unfortunately those are software changes that get announced in June and shipped in Sept, so we'll have to wait about a year.


Steve is dead, move on.


Damn it. Really? 😀


I use the stock apps for most things because I’m tired of paying for subscriptions for everything. I wouldn’t mind a one time purchase but I’m not paying $10 a month indefinitely for something that I can basically get for free.


>  I don’t understand why people even bother   
>  
> Now if only Apple allowed those 3rd party apps to integrate as well as their own… 

You answered your own question.... integration between everything.


What ? Everyone wants rewritten Xcode. It doesn’t even support plugins and is so subpar compared to competition. 

Instead, they allocate macOS resources on useless stuff…


Lol at people who have never worked in software development.

Software is hard. Simu-ship for different form factors is extra hard. I am sure there's someone at Apple getting a bad annual review for the iPad version being late. And if they had delayed the iPhone version until iPad was ready, this sub would be up in arms OMG FALSE ADVERTISNG OMG APPLE BAD BAD BADADASDAD!!!

Software is hard. Sometimes things are late. Nobody's happy about it, and it is not a triple bank shot conspiracy. It's just how the business works.

EDIT: and I forgot we're literally whining about the first beta of 17.2. For all we know the iPad version will appear in DB2 and all the people imagining elaborate conspiracies will just slink away and wait for the next opportunity to imagine things.


iPad Calculator technology has to be invented first, and that one isn’t coming before fusion energy.


wasnt the point of swift ui and all these other dev tech apple has been rolling out so that it was easy to build for all their platforms at once?


>Many people who journal do it in a full page format at the end of the day, not in bits throughout the day. 

Do they really think I'm gonna type a full-on post on my iPhone 13 mini? Wtf?


“This fall” has been a thing for years. 

They’ve always announced features coming over the course of the version number.


I don't think anyone is saying an iPad app is undesirable. Are you seeing that anywhere?


You gotta wait for the iOS DLC to get the full update!


Try turning it sideways…


When I'm doing math homework and such on my iPad it's incredibly useful to have a calculator app open on the side. I'm not going to exit the app to use the search bar every time I need to do a calculation. My only option is to use a mediocre and ad infested 3rd party app. The calculator app even on iPhone is better if you need to quickly do multiple operations


Because I like to have a calculator app pulled up in slide over when I’m budgeting on my iPad. Then I don’t have to switch devices or screens. I have a calculator app downloaded that fills that role though but I’d like to see a widget calculator too


who uses search for calculations. what the


TIL you can do calculations in search.


Wrong and I will fight Apple fanboys on this topic to the death. A numpad style input is much faster than typing on a keyboard for doing calculations.


It’s a great app… which means Google will probably kill it next year sometime


Obsidian is fantastic.


They need to get the miniLED screens to match the quality of those on the MacBook Pros, when I owned an miniLED iPad Pro I noticed far more blooming and it was very distracting.


The pros would be such bad ass little mini Mac os devices too. It would be awesome


Isn’t it a good thing that you don’t want to upgrade for awhile? Apple putting in good processors so you can keep using it for years is great. That’s exactly what I want from an iPad.


>If I could run desktop applications like Sketch on my iPad I would never bring my MacBook anywhere.

That's why they won't upgrade the OS. They want you to own ALL the devices and be stuck in the ecosystem.

It's annoying because you hear "they don't want to cannibalize MacBook sales", but it doesnt work like that. The kind of person that wants a Surface Pro is different than the person that wants a dedicated laptop or tablet. But there aren't enough Apple users that are that technologically inclined so here we are.


I could see them ditching the iPad Pros but keeping the air and mini


You are forgetting that apart from the visuals, they are all the same OS. Apple intentionally disallows running macOS apps on iPads. There is no reason for iPadOS to not support them, or rather the apps not supporting iPadOS.


I don’t enjoy using my MacBook Pro a lot of the time, because of its hard edge and butterfly keyboard being so far up, I usually prop a folded folder or something underneath of it to let it stand leaning forward.


Yep! I forget about it sometimes, and I wish I could just choose to swipe on the full sized keyboard, but it’s there! 😅


I agree with you on subscriptions, and I guess these are almost universally hated.

However, for journaling specifically, Day One does have a free tier and if you want premium features it’s less than $3 per month. Not too bad for something you’d use daily. I don’t journal, but if I wanted to I’d probably just start with some document processor, not a dedicated app that stores your data in a closed format.

If you like Apple’s software that’s great. I don’t. In fact, it’s the main reason I’m pulling out of the ecosystem (still typing this on an old iPhone), despite the hardware often being very good.


Which is not exclusive to Apple. What is exclusive is that 3rd parties are artificially limited, crippling the customer’s ability to mix and match in favor of Apple’s own solutions.

This is a personal thing of course. I find it increasingly difficult to tolerate the walled garden while the things inside the garden are often so far behind.

I am aware of the subreddit I’m in and I’m sure most of you will not agree. I will keep getting rid of Apple stuff until only my MacBook Air is left.

Edit: by the way, the above applies to software. Apple’s hardware is actually very good and its SoCs are still ahead of the competition (although less than previous years). This is something I’ve taken for granted for years.


And you think the competition was just written from scratch? Get real.


Lmao this is extremely ironic considering how much apple advertises how easy it is to simu-ship with catalyst. If they can’t even follow their own guidelines who will?


>	And if they had delayed the iPhone version until iPad was ready, this sub would be up in arms OMG FALSE ADVERTISNG OMG APPLE BAD BAD BADADASDAD!!!

Or, and hear me out, they wait until the product is ready to ship for all platforms before announcing.


I could see it being a phased approach. Basic functionality in an iPhone app, then you have a team that fully understands the codebase and can quickly expand and iterate on it to create the more fully featured iPad/Mac app.


To be fair, this isn't Joe Schmo, some indie developer, who says "sorry I meant to have it ready but then my dog died and my sister got sick and I had to take some personal time". This is Apple, a company valued at one point around a trillion dollars. Owning an iPad, an iPhone and a Mac would cost multiple thousands of dollars and you have to keep buying products every few years to stay updated, especially Macs.

I wouldn't say people are whining, they're just disappointed, which is pretty fair as far as I'm concerned. No, it's no great tragedy, it's just a little bit underwhelming.


>Lol at people who have never worked in software development.  
>  
>Software is hard. Simu-ship for different form factors is extra 

Apple has 10s of thousands of developers, who they pay amazingly well. Can't they ask a few of those people to create iPad / Mac versions?

Also, about the "software is hard" part. I'm a software engineer, and most software is not that hard. Look at Twitter. They fired 70% of their staff and it still feels the same. But we had armchair "software experts" acting like the whole site would be unusable after the layoffs.


Bro it’s a fuckin journaling app. “Software is hard”

Quit simping for Apple.


> Software is hard

*SOME* software is hard.  This is a simple journaling app.  Most junior devs could knock it up over a weekend.


I mean this is the same sub that consistently wonders why $5 perpetual update apps aren't a viable business model.


>MG APPLE BAD BAD BADADASDAD!!!

That just summed up several subreddits.


lol thank you. These same people will complain if they released things early with bugs in it.  You literally cannot win.


At this point, I feel like Apple is low-key trolling us regarding a native iPad Calculator app.

I’m sure I’m over simplifying, but from the outside, looking in, it sure feels like somebody could just take an afternoon and port
the landscape view advanced version UI of the Calculator app over from iOS. Surely iOS and iPadOS haven’t diverged *that* much.


>iPad Calculator

That sounds like liberal talk.


This is what happens when all the best people are on the new platform. The classical music and journal team are likely understaffed.

Although, depending on how this app works, if it’s like freeform, but with even more inputs, such as parsing the photo app… I can see it needing different interface priorities between devices.


No they expect to upsell you to the big iPhone models with bigger profit margins.


[deleted]


I have a feeling a very cheap and basic calculator app for iPad would be an easy sell. Sell it on the store ad free for 50 cents and it’ll sell well. 

Instead they get rammed full of ads or lock things like square root behind a paywall.


I use PC Calc Lite. It’s been good to me since my iPhone 3GS


Spotlight is extremely versatile across all platforms and can do far more than just search.

Bonus: on windows, you can do a similar thing with the Start menu, just bring it up and start typing


And currency conversions!


I wish they’d put the miniLED on the 11 inch pro so I can give myself a reason to upgrade my 2018 model


Expensive iPads really don’t make sense with how cheap MacBooks have gotten for their performance. The $1000 Intel MacBook Air used to be unusable.


$36 a year for a journal seems very expensive. At that point I’d rather just use Notes.


Day One’s free tier does not allow you to use *your own iCloud storage* to sync the journal between devices


There is also this one which I use on iPhone, iPad and Mac. Synchronizes via iCloud and can use password protection. It is one-time only purchase. Separate for Mac and Mobile.

I'm not saying you're wrong in stating that Apple is the one limiting 3rd party integration. I'm just answering your original question.

> I don’t understand why people even bother with Apple’s stock apps 

The answer is the integration. The reason 3rd party apps don't have the integration (Apple's doing), doesn't change the fact that those apps just don't have what people are looking for, whether it's the fault of those apps or not.

It's up to the consumer on if the integration in the ecosystem is more important than what a 3rd party offers.


Well yeah IntelliJ is its own platform, has its issues but beat Xcode on any metrics


> Bro it’s a fuckin journaling app.

It still is going to involve a lot of software development resources unless if it's extremely barebones. There's a lot more to it than clicking a button. If software is as simple as you're making it out to be then Apple would never need to push updates out ever again.


The stupidity of you lot is actually astounding.

None of you are software developers yet here you are offering your bloated and boundless opinion on a topic you’ve no knowledge off.

You’re a WOW player and you’re telling me it’s easy to develop a journaling app?

Apple has some of the worlds brightest and sharpest minds, if developing a “journal app” is taking this long, maybe it’s because developing a “journal app” is actually, pretty, fucking difficult.


Wut?


I'm just surprised how much of that is on Apple subreddits. I thought all of the Apple subreddits would just be full of Apple simps, but apparently I was wrong.


Meta is doing the same with Instagram. Why would anyone want to look at *pictures* with their iPad?


they truly haven’t - otherwise developing apps for iPadOS and iOS would be a nightmare.


It has. And don't call me surely.


The only thing they're doing is telling developers to not bother with iPads. If even Apple thinks it's too much effort to develop an iPad version (and that's after developing multiple cross platform frameworks while not having to deal with Win/Android) why should anybody else?


They definitely are. It’s become almost meme like. As it gets people talking about iPad they probably see it as free marketing. iPhone apps run fine on iPad, they could literally just let you install the iPhone one, yet the don’t.


I’d just like a basic calculator in a multitasking for when I budget on my iPad. 

It feels ridiculous to have an actual calculator next to a device which is so capable, yet cannot have a calculator. 

I am aware apps exist, but I refuse to pay or have ads on something that should be there.


Personally I find the calculator app easier. Using the operators without having to shift is quicker for me. I don’t use it on my macs as I don’t have the numpad keyboard.

I don’t have an iPad but I’ve never understood why Apple never ported it to the iPad. I can’t imagine it’d be that much work.


Happens to the best of us :)


lmao

How long have you owned an iPhone? 😭


That’s the one I’ve been using too and tbh it’s been  working quite well. There are still some paywalled features tho (not criticizing the dev as they need to make money somehow) but still the fact that you cannot get a fully functional calculator without needed to pay or be the product is baffling


The amount of people I work with that don't realize that, when I tell them to go to the start menu, and just start typing....and they instead go to the magnifying glass icon which for some stupid reason takes ages to load up...it's maddening. Start comes up instantly, go there!


Same, I'm on a gen 1 Pro 12" model.  I've been waiting to buy an 11" for years because I want the smaller size, but I need OLED or MiniLED.  After using OLED on my phone I simply can't tolerate the LCD displays on these things anymore.


Ironically Pros sell the most and the total iPad sales have doubled since 2018.


As a musician, the 12.9” iPads are *essential*


My 2017 MacBook Air was my favorite laptop ever. I know it may sound weird, but I kind of miss that design. Especially the glowing logo


Depends on how often you use it I guess. If it’s an important function for you that you use daily or even multiple times per day, why not? Like I said, it’s also not for me. I have a subscription on Spotify and that’s it.

For perspective: where I live, a 128GB iphone 15 pro is 1229 euro, which currently converts to $1300. Suppose you use that phone for 4 years. Having such a subscription ($35/year) would increase the cost with about 10%.

Of course that number fluctuates depending on how often you change phones, if you want something more or less than the base model pro, whether you monetize the residual value, etc. But to give an impression. Now do the calculation for something like Headspace, which is $70/year.


Thanks for the tip. I don’t journal myself so I just took what looks like the most popular one in the app store right now. $9 is a very reasonable price and something I would pay if I had a need for a journaling app.


I agree completely.


Thank you for your input, Mr. Cook


It's a journal app built (presumably) built on top of apples own toolkits. Takes a day to port it over to iPad. Not like it's a game engine or years of proprietary work or anything.


Unlimited shrimps


In the specific case of Instagram, I could almost see the logic being that they want you taking (and posting) pictures as much or more than they want you just looking at them.

And the cameras on the iPads aren’t as advanced as those on the iPhone. I’m pretty sure even the iPad Pro camera array is basically the same thing as the base iPhone at this point, let alone the iPhone Pro.

But yeah, it’s odd that there is no Instagram app for iPad. People are still at least out there, passively scrolling, and commenting on their friends’ accounts. The iPad would be actually superior to the iPhone for those two parts of the equation.


This is also a bit of a Zuck f\*cking Apple thing though.


Haha. Voice dictation strikes again.

Edited.

Thanks!


Wow. Your one use case for your line of work needs an iPad. The average person that’s deciding on spending $1500 on a device should go with a MacBook over an iPad. That’s all I’m saying.


Function > design. It was slow


> If it’s an important function for you that you use daily or even multiple times per day, why not?

Just because someone makes an app doesn't justify perpetual payments. I firmly believe in paying money for good products, and supporting peoples' work. However the market for apps is *beyond* saturated, and having to pay forever to access your private thoughts? Are they adding new features every month or do they just know that people won't pay for the app any other way?

Lifetime licenses need to make a comeback. Plenty of folks would happily pay once and just have the thing they paid for.


My guy it’s gotta take a week to do testing for a rollout of any of Apple’s first-party apps *minimum*. Like you can build it on the swiftUI stack for better cross-platform compatibility but that doesn’t mean you just press play and it works. Get outta here with that armchair development lol


Some people will run around with their iPads and take pictures, though. We’ve all seen them!


I thought about this too and had a different hypothesis. Right now photos posted to IG are 1080x1080 resolution (or 1080x1350 for portrait), and they are compressed somewhat heavily. Essentially the quality of the final image is just barely good enough to look passable on a phone.

If they were to develop an iPad specific app, they would have to display higher resolution photos and with less compression. Server costs have to be significant, and this could easily 2x or 3x the image size which eats into storage and bandwidth. So with that in mind, I do think they can push the idea that IG is a phone-only service.


he's fucking with apple by... giving up the engagement he'd get on an iPad version?

yea, that makes sense.


Being that Mac’s don’t have touch screens, no. Being able to annotate with the pencil is critical to more than my use case. But I wasn’t even attacking your line of reasoning just saying why the products important to me.

I also have never paid more than 750 for an iPad,  always go used or certified refurb. I’ve had 2 or 3 due to theft.


Not really at first lol. It was a fine laptop for me at the time


They put an M1 in the same chassis. Seemed to work well.


As a consumer I fully agree. I have stated already twice I don’t like the subscription model and more than the next guy.

However, from the developer POV I get it. Making high quality software is expensive, and you’re probably only going to make money if your app become really popular (doubtful for a journaling app I think), or if you manage to charge significantly for it. Considering my example, 10% of the TCO of an average iPhone equates to $130. That’s a hefty upfront cost, that probably would grind sales to a complete stop. Even half that (because in this example I am assuming 4 years of continuous payment, which is a lot), you’re still looking at 65 bucks. Nobody is going to pay that for a mobile app, regardless how positive the reviews. And selling it at $10 or so is probably not going to pay the bills.

I guess for journaling fans, Apple including a stock app is good news. Even with my negative bias towards Apple software, it’s probably going to a be a better experience than using plain Notes. And while probably not as good as the (mature) Day One premium edition, maybe it’s good enough for most users. I don’t think the guys at Day One HQ are having a good time these days.


You could use Capture365. It is one-time purchase for Mac and one-time for iOS/iPadOS. Has encryption. - It can do a lot. Not updated for some time now, probably because it is not a subscription app. But it does not matter. It is very useful as it is.

I used to develop applications for a living

It's not like they haven't had months to develop this, its not like apple is the apollo dev where its a one-man indie show. They absolutely have the manpower to do it they just choose not to. 

Swiftui will do 95% of the work for you.


I’ve not myself, but I’m sure someone has.


Instagram also has a website though, that you can view on a computer. So it's already not a phone-only service.


You know how much he’s lost because of Apple’s privacy policies right? 

Engagement isn’t gonna make that up. Meta also hasn’t made a iPad version for the super popular What’sApp either.


I also use the pro for photography and editing. I have no desire to open macbook and use it over the touch and pen enabled ipad.


Cause the chassis doesn’t matter. M1 is also way less power consuming


I also sympathize with developers but a lot of them don't realize that the gold rush is long since over. If your business idea is "I'll make a cool app that people will want to buy", you don't have a business. Even if it's a good idea for an app, the whole thing can vanish the second you get Sherlocked.


That’s true! Just thinking out loud here: a web page doesn’t have to fill the screen. It’s pretty normalized to actually leave a lot of empty space. So the images still are the regular size. With an iPad app, maybe the expectation would be something more like phone app. Where the gallery and viewing fill the whole screen. More like you’re looking through your own photos on your iPhone and iPad.

I’d also be curious about how screen resolutions and scaling impact this. I think most laptop and desktop displays are still 1920x1080. Even though high resolution ones are continually getting more popular. iPad 11” is higher resolution than that.


How do the images look on larger screens, regarding u/loopernova’s hypothesis on resolutions?


What is the sunk cost fallacy, anyway?


> The company will offer a 12-month interest-free payment plan for iPads, Macs, the Apple Pencil and iPad keyboards, as well as the Mac XDR Display monitor, and six months with no interest for the AirPods, Apple TV, and HomePod, the people said.


Barclays Apple Card has deferred financing which was really helpful in buying my Mac during grad school. Would be great if Apple Card gets something like this.


Yes! Now I can get an Apple Pencil!


I’d love if they brought any kind of financing for iPhones to Canada. No options at all. Carriers “offer financing” but you also need a plan, so not really financing it then, that’s just a regular contract


Will definitely be a sweet offering from Apple.


Thank god. I just returned a defective 2020 iPad Pro to amazon(after a huge hassle from them of course). I was going to buy the same exact model from Apple themselves but I will just wait for this.


Do getting the monthly installments give you any sort of hard pull to your credit? I was thinking about doing it for the 12 when it comes out.


Now to improve my credit score lol


Damn it. Just bought a MacBook Pro on the Apple Card. They gonna get me on the interest!

They are getting closer to the subscription model Cook teased during a earnings call last year.

Is the Apple Card available in the UK?


fucking excellent. been waiting to get a imac 27 inch with my student discount. anyone know if the magic trackpad 2 is worth it?


This is great and all but I assume they will need a way for customers to pay their bill outside of owning an iPhone.


Does the current 0% interest monthly payments currently work for the refurbished iPhones?

Just wondering if I could expect the same for when this comes out for iPads. I would love a one of the modern iPad pros with the mostly bezel free design. But I’d rather get the refurbished and save some money.


Just in time when my 8 year old Retina 2012 is labeled Obsolete.


All hail, the Bank of Apple.


Just curious: is it really a good idea to be getting an iPad on payments? Seems like a bad idea for a lot of people


The lord has answered our prayers. Praise him!

Him=Apple Tim


That woulda been nice... but i have no payments.


Sweet! I’ve been waiting for them to add plans like that!


Genius marketing, I'll probably end up upgrading my MacBook or iPad because of this... even though I really don't need to.


It is a good idea for people like me who have to wait until end of the year for company allowance (bonus) for any item. This is like for Tax purpose. So if I put in monthly payment, I can pay it off with company money at the end of the year.


damn, I keep telling myself I don’t need an iPad Pro, but they’re trying very hard to get me to think otherwise.


I still gotta wait for Apple Card to be supported here


best payment option is to get a 0% interest credit card with as long as possible a interest free offer in it as possible, then use that to pay for big purchases. You can then pay your credit card off monthly. Better for your credit score and once initially approved you don’t have to keep applying every purchase you make


Would be interested in simply getting any kind of Apple Card on my phone in the UK


[removed]


Interesting news, I hope also in Italy, when Apple will make the Apple Card available in my country.  This is interesting news!


What exactly is new? Didn’t they already have this? I used 0% finance to split the cost of my iPhone, iMac, MacBook Pro and an Apple Watch over 12 months. It was right there on the Apple website when I bought.


I wish we could get a 0% APR plan in Ireland, we cant use UK because you need an UK address


So basically just the same as getting it through your carrier except you have interest to pay if you don’t pay it off in half the time as a regular upgrade


My only question is will getting a Mac on payment plan benefit my credit enough to choose payments over outright


For me was a matter of charging it a full cycle! Not just some minutes!


Does this apply for refurbished products too?


Lend you the money to buy the product lol


I suppose this will only be available in the US?


Does Apple plan on releasing Apple Card in Canada?


Would love that!


And here I am living a piece of shit country where CCs have an interest rate of 80% and cash back is something they will never ever implement.


Nice


I’m guessing people with scores around 650 have no chance of getting approved for an Apple Card  by chance?


That would honestly help me switch over to Mac. I’d keep my windows laptop for some basic games and my iTunes management for my iPods, but go to Mac for the every day and iPhone management and Apple Music and eco system. About 90 bucks a month for the MacBook I’d get. But I need to get my one and only other CC paid down to a more respectable level and my parents and I are looking at getting me a new vehicle in my own name and what not (I’m 26 and we got my last car when I was 19/20) so that will eat into my finances a lot lol

Chase Freedom Unlimited can give 3.5% cash back if you go through the Shop with Chase portal first. If you're okay having an annual fee, pair that with a Sapphire Reserve and now it's 5.25% back, minimum.

Oh, and both the Freedom Unlimited and Sapphire Reserve have automatic warranty extensions, whereas Apple Card doesn't.

Hard pass for me.

Edit: clarification - this logic only applies to people who pay their cards off in full every month and therefore avoid interest.


When they will create something new instead of squeezing the people's wallet? this is not the actual philosophy why Apple was created. And no, an iPhone, iMac, etc is not something new.


When noone buys your devices because of the price so you start a credit company to get people to buy your devices on a monthly scheme instead of reducing the prices to what they should actually be given the build quality and specifications


that's one way to make people forget the price is RIDICULOUS!


I got a Tesla. Will they accept a trade in?


Too bad it's not in Canada


Apple Card still not available in Canada...


We are introducing installments wait are we live in 90s


I really want that Mac Pro but my limit is only $2000


Horrible support from Apple Card just want to drop the card itself.


They have amassed a huge amount of cash, and this is their next step to becoming a financial institution. Apple Bank. Now they will charge you interest to rent your\* phone to you.

\*It won't be long before that fine print says the physical device is always their property, and you are just borrowing it. Even after all payments are made, it's still their property because copyright or something. All unauthorized repairs are considered vandalism, and you, the custodian will be held liable.


Oh ok. Yea I havnt asked for since like I think a month or two ago and I received one in March I think then they told me I asked to fast so I wanna wait till like late July to ask again just so I have a higher limit for better utilization and stuff when I apply for a car loan here soon plus a higher limit is just nice to have


Barclay card would offer 18 months interest free for Apple purchases over $1,000 (and I'd get 3x points on the purchase). Still no compelling reason for me to get an Apple Card.

Edit: because I've answered it 7 times already, but people aren't reading the comments below and keep asking me the same question: "Isn't it a one time promotion when you sign up?": Yes it's a initial promotion, but Barclays has regularly offered subsequent promotions for the same value (6/12/18 mo 0% depending on the cost of the purchase) at various times, and I've also called customer support to see if they can add the promotion to my account when I wanted to make a purchase.


I would like an iMac upgrade program.


I guess I’ll take it all...?


6 months for AirPods is great. I wouldn’t get Apple Card anyway tho.


Sound like every store selling apple products in Poland....


Any idea when this’ll come to Canada?


Six months to pay off ~$200 AirPods, Apple TV, or HomePod is great but only 12 to pay off a $1,500 MacBook? You would think the macs would score at least 18 months, no? At least that’s what I can get with my Amazon credit card. Can’t really complain though, it’s great that they’re finally opening up access to the rest of their products.


For people who have the old Barclays card, it’s a very similar offer: 0% financing for 6-18 months depending on purchase price, and 3% back albeit as Apple Store credit rather than cash. 

Now, though, Barclays changed the card for new applicants and got rid of the 3% back. For those who don’t already have the Barclays card, the Apple Card is a clearly better deal (if they do in fact add the 0% financing).


For the first purchase only. After that, it’s just a regular credit card with a high APR and marginal percentage back as store credit.

I had/have the Barclaycard and I was a little surprised at how...crappy...it was to be a financial product tied to Apple.


I wish they would bring back the loan scheme for students. When I started university back in 2015 they were offering four year loans on Macs. All you needed was a co-signer. It was great for getting me an excellent computer for university (one which I still use today) and building up my credit at a young age.


I thought students couldn’t get Barclays financing?


Pay it off at your own pace with 12-60 low monthly payments, interest-free! Debt slavery forever 🇺🇸


I’m sorry but if you can’t afford to buy a damn pen outright maybe don’t finance ? Unless that was sarcasm than you gave me a good chuckle.


They took 4 years to bring us News.

FUCKING NEWS!

Don't hold your breath.

But really, I came here for this comment. It frustrates me just as much that we're basically priority #501 out of 500 in most things Apple does.

Don’t hold your breath, the Apple Authorized Retail Partners have financing options in Canada. At least most of them do.


Hello from South Africa. No interest-free financing, no Apple Pay, no Apple Card, no Apple news app.


You have an iPhone without a mobile plan?

What's the difference between your carrier giving you free money to buy an iPhone monthly over 2-3 years and your credit card offering a 0% rate monthly pay back?


That sucks, it really does. But Canada lives partially inside America (some places you can eat food in restaurants between Canada and America) there’s no excuses for that. Other than Canadian carriers being a bunch of bullshit because it costs so much for data (there’s a plan that is $45 and you get 1GB)


USA number 1


If you can't find 7-800 upfront, is it really wise to add a debt to your budget?


I just bought my MacBook last week. Would’ve been nice to have this option.


If you already have the Apple Card, no. You’ll get a hard pull for the Apple Card if you’re approved and you accept, but if you have it already they don’t need a credit check to do monthly payments for iPhone. The only thing you need if you already have the card is to have enough available credit to cover the purchase. 

Something else of note is that it adds the total of the device to your credit card total and each monthly payment brings it down, so if you have a $3,000 credit limit and buy a $2,400 MacBook, you’ll have $2,400 of your $3,000 total utilized, which could affect your credit score. If your credit limit is higher though it might not matter.


Nope, just the initial pull for applying for the card.


Same here


Currently, one of the features with Apple Card financing for iPhone is that as long as you have enough balance, it does not require a new credit check. We obviously don’t know of that will hold for new more expensive devices...


Shhhh! If Mark Zuckerberg hears you you’ll be flooded by CreditKarma ads!! (Unless you have Adblock)


If you can afford the zero interest monthly payments after the purchase, why not start saving that much every month now to put towards the purchase?


You haven’t been able to save 2-3K in the last 9 years? There’s something else going on.


Corporations already have access to a subscription model. :)


No

Magic Trackpad 2 is a joy to use. I’m not sure I’d pay full price for it though, I got mine on eBay for half the cost.


I love my Magic Trackpad, but don't buy it direct from Apple if you can. I got mine for $99 NEW on OfferUp. Works like a dream.

Edit: I see it's $50 with the iMac. Nice.


Do they? It’s the ultimate lock-in.


Not sure why you’d want the card if you don’t have an iPhone tbh


You can pay it on an iPad. You can also call in.


You can manage your Apple Card, including making payments, on an iPad now.


[deleted]


Not at this time.

if you really need it but don't want to tie up all your money at once, i would say yes.

if you are buying cus you need to have the latest tech device then no.


I buy all my iPads and iPhones through Verizon on payments because it’s interest free. If I want to upgrade I just pay it off first. Doing it this way is actually better credit wise because Verizon doesn’t report the balance like an interest free credit card would.


It can be good for some people, but I also see it being bad for a lot of people. Apple is still a status symbol and this will enable people to buy many apple products and be in apple debt with the latest and greatest rather than using older models.


Yes terrible idea actually


I personally never buy anything I couldn’t already pay off immediately. That’s why I don’t like instalments and the nagging feeling it entails.


>	Just curious: is it really a good idea to be getting an iPad on payments? 

“Match the expense time-period to the benefit time-period” is a Generally Accepted Accounting Principal. If the iPad is going to help you in October, you should suffer the pain of paying for it in same October.

>	Seems like a bad idea for a lot of people

It is a bad idea to pay more than something is worth, and maybe monthly payments will encourage a lot of people to overpay. Maybe this could be mitigated by requiring a down payment equal to six monthly payments, which would be 25%.


If you were going to use it for school maybe not a bad idea. School costs add up fast so I understand wanting to spread it out more. (Plus you can store your pirated textbooks easily on your new iPad!) Probably a bad idea if you don’t need it for school or career interests.


If you can afford it it’d a great deal.


If it's a 0% interest rate like how iPhone monthly payments through Apple Card are,... it could be a good way to break up the expense.

EDIT: Depending on what you're using for. I have had two Pro line iPads, and I found them basically useless productivity wise. They didn't do anything better than what I could do with my iPhone and Macbook. Even using the Apple Pencil... wasn't a fan of that either. 

It was also pretty useless for reading e-books, as it was too heavy for reading books for 30 minutes to hours at a time. All in all, not a fan.


How? It’s 0% interest.


That’s what they are hoping for, and for people who can’t actually afford to purchase it to, well, purchase it.


They aren’t worth it unless you are into digital art or plan to use it as a mobile monitor in my opinion.


Tmobile has Jump for iPads and iPhones. I’ve been doing that for awhile. As soon as a new iPad Pro comes out, I’ll jump to a new one.


Before it was on the old Barclays Apple card. Now it will be on the new Apple card


You obviously didn’t read the article. Payments are zero interest as long as they’re made on time.


Some people use credit as their primary payment to get any rewards. Then pay off the total.


umm. So you’re okay paying the interest and the annual fee?  Are you aware that Apple card gives you 3% on purchases from Apple store?


Well, he's partially right... Aren't volume sales gradually decreasing year over year? (please correct me if I'm wrong)


Nobody buys the devices? What planet are you on? These aren’t android devices.


Who the hell is Noone?


>When no one buys your devices

The f u c k?


Request an increase.


Wouldn’t surprise me at all to see Apple dissolve its relationship with Barclay Card.


This would apply for things <$1k though as well and 3% cash back which id take over points. Plus isn’t the Barclays relationship being slowly dissolved?


I got the Apple Card because “why not?”


I got a barclaycard to buy an iPad and was offered 12 or 18 months interest free. When I went to buy an iPhone I found out that that was a one time offer when I signed up. You get this offer on anything over 1,000?


The thing I dislike about this card is that the rewards come in the form of an Apple/iTunes Store gift card and are only transferred out when you accumulate $25 worth. At least with Apple Card, the cashback is in the form of actual cash.


You can only use the Barclaycard offer once; after that the APR will be god-awful relative to similar cards (e.g. BestBuy store card). Their customer service is utter garbage too.

EDIT: idk what the hell people are talking about with these promotions. I opened the card in 2015 and paid off the initial purchase over the course of the following year (18 months?). I kept the card open until earlier this year and actively made purchases with it that I paid off every month. I never once received an email about being able to make another interest-free purchase at Apple or anywhere else.


But Barclay card is one time use for that offer right?


Yeah but that offer was only good for the first 30 days of opening the line of credit.


I just want one because it’s Titanium, and to put my Apple subscriptions on it for the rewards. Cards made of metal, or stone are the best


Best Buy offers 24 months interest-free with their card.


Tbh I only recommend it if people need an easy to get, no foreign transaction fee card ... and it might be the reason I have it. The titanium is cool though.


The Barclay card gives points?


For purchases within the first couple of days of having the card. After that you don’t get any deals.


I thought you only get that 18 months interest free special financing on purchases made at Apple within the first 30 days of account opening?


Yeah... about that.  I have a fantastic credit score and a high income.... they only gave me a $1,700 limit.  I've used the card on other things... but I wasn't given a high enough credit limit to actually buy the device I was going to - I had to use a different card.


I have both and my use of the Barclay is basically zero. Their rewards just were not compelling and the points to dollar to email to gift card hoops is just annoying. I love just having cash right back and able to used. Plus you get 3% at the Apple store so it’s pretty solid


You get 3% cash back with the Apple Card and it’s actual money


They do? My card only offered that initially.


Anyone who applied for the Barclay financing Visa passed August 2019 does not get the rewards.


Barclay only approved me for something like $400, which is ridiculous.  Not enough to buy the iMac I was going to use it for.  My credit score is over 800 on Transunion, and my lowest credit limit is $7,000.


Isn’t that only on initial purchase?

If Apple offers repeat zero interest deals to existing cardholders and loyal customers this could prove serious incentive to step up and choose higher profit products. My gut says this would mean more XR or MBA type customers converted into flagship 11 or MBP customers.


I thought the Barclay card interest-free program was only for purchases made in the first year or something?


The compelling reason is that it doesn’t cost you anything to get one and it’s a nice card to have for the 2% Apple Pay cashback if you’re purchasing something that you don’t have a better card for.


Isnt the Barclays card a one time promotion?


[deleted]


Don't do it. It's a scam. I've been dealing with them for a year now because they have random interest charges. Almost to the point where I'm getting lawyers involved


Oh man! New iMacs and a iMac upgrade program, that combo is so good it’s almost evil.


How often do you need to upgrade your iMac? I consider myself a bit of a power user and my 27” from 2012 is still running decently, getting close to the point of an upgrade now, but it’s been 8 years.

The bigger issue is how would they time it? Sometimes they go nearly 2 years without an upgrade and then there are years like 2015 where they have 2 in a year.


Oh wow didn’t know they got rid of that 3%.


That 3% back I just get as an iTunes card, which would be useful.


No it’s a recurring thing. The financing promo keeps coming back several times a year.


There's a possibility they cancelled those because of low repayment or had to create too many allowances for unpayed accounts and had to resort to selling those receivables.


When the promo is activated, any purchase made at the Apple store using the card gets financed.


Well, don't forget, because of inflation, $1 in your pocket today is more valuable than $1 in your pocket a year from now.

An interest-free loan lets you have an item that costs $x in 2020 money but you get to a portion of it off in 2021's dollars.

That's why ultra-rich people take out mortgages on their houses. Sure, they could buy their house in cash... but the banks know they're good for the money, so the banks give them ultra-low interest loans. So between inflation and investments, they'd rather pay the interest and keep the money than live debt-free.


TIL forever is only 12-60 months!


It’s not a pen it’s an Apple Pencil!

Then once that’s paid off I can start saving for an iPad...


If you feel this way than here in Poland we don’t even have the typing suggestions.


I can’t give you silver (so take this 🥇) but know that I laughed out loud :)


At least you have it. News is still only available in 4 countries, out of ~200.


Directly from manufacturers too. They used to have iPhone financing in Canada but they took it away. You can sort of finance Samsung but only a certain amount. I know Motorola pushed financing to me when I bought a sprint moto x “$20 a month for a new moto” is what it usually said


Yeah $120 a month. That’s for the soon to be 2 year old xs


Hello from UK/Canada a lot of my cousins are in South Africa! I’m from England but live in Canada. Small world


My iPhone XR has had issues while it was under warranty, it’s only gotten worse. Bluetooth semi disconnects, processor overheats when camera is used but doesn’t cool down again. GPS is off enough to mess up driving around a new town/city. 
I brought my phone to my carrier. My carrier (and all others) are asking way too much upfront. Therein lies the issue; it’s $975 down then $30 on my plan after that (which isn’t an issue) that’s on medium which puts my plan starting at $45 (giving me 1GB of data) if I start at $75 and give them $615 down I can get it but then it’s still $30 a month and 15% tax. How much it normally costs itself in America is how much the down payment is


When it's legitimately interest free financing, sometimes it's nice to be able to have that extra $600 in checking to cover surprises without having to dip into an emergency fund.


Yes, my current phone is shit enough that I need a phone and if I’m buying it at current prices then I may as well buy it new so there’s less of a chance of issues. 
I hate that sentiment though “you can’t afford this so frick you”
How about make it affordable for everyone by doing payments. iPhones last a long time. I’m fine paying for it over a few years, if possible, because I know it’s going to be worth it over the next few years after that


That’s funny you said $3000 because that’s actually my limit on the card😂 I’m hope for more later on but yea I already knew about the utilization thing I just thought that u get a hard pull because it’s similar to getting a loan on something but thank you


I don’t understand that logic. If my credit limit is 3K and I’m paying 200 a month for a year why isn’t my utilization 200/3000 at the end of the month instead of 2400/3000, then 2200/3000 etc as you’re saying?


Opening*. No hard pull on record if you don’t open the card or you get rejected


I use Apple News, Reddit, YouTube and DuckDuckGo.


Because it's best to keep as much liquidity on hand and a 0% financing cost you nothing.  The only thing you have to worry about is not being able to make the payments, which can be offset because Apple hardware depreciates slowly and can be sold off if things get bad enough.  As long as you are financially stable and aren't over extending your budget (or having to make room to afford the payments), 0% financing is a terrific thing.


If you have a better credit card, why not pay it off in full and use the cashback as a substantial discount?


Well if you need the computer(or w/e) TODAY instead of a year into the future seems like a good reason.


Not OP but even though I can buy a new MacBook, I’m more inclined to keep using my 2012 since it’s still working and doesn’t require me dropping $1,500+ at once. Apple introducing a monthly payment makes it easier to budget for the payment, and will probably be the reason I finally upgrade.


The iMac would be the first apppe computer I get and it’s only 50 bucks more to get the Magic Trackpad so I figure it could be a good gamble


Ehh for 50 bucks I’ll take the plunge. With COVID and all I don’t wanna go out to test it. Hopefully Apple stats this financing soon


It’s 50 bucks for me if I buy it with an iMac 27 inch so I’m prob gonna buy it. Just waiting for Apple to allow financing with the Apple Card hopefully sooner than later


I’d like to be able to pay my card via a browser.


no iPhone but a Mac os user


Is it interest free?


If you have to use all your money to buy an iphone, you can't afford an iphone.


It’s great that is interest free but you also have to have that data plan to and that’s $20 a month. Or $240 a year


>	this will enable people to buy many apple products

Only people whom Apple has authorized after a hard-pull credit check, and only to the extent of the credit line Apple extends after that hard-pull credit check.


Same here. I go the Dave Ramsay way of life. I was in a lot of debt and it just always seemed like i had such high monthly expenses. At one point i had a $500 monthly phone bill because of all the device payments i had on it. Ever since discovering Ramsay, i pay cash for everything and life is so much less stressful. Just work and save up for a couple months and buy it outright, vs a bill you get for a whopping 24 months. Most people just want things immediately but waiting is so much more worth it


I like the 6 month pay option. I remember they used to do it for Apple watches and I thought that was so much more manageable than 2 whole years


Not everybody, but just the nature of extending out your purchase to 24 months. Having a 24 month commitment vs something you could save up for and own outright isn’t always the best choice. And some people I’ve talked to on here will say excitedly “I got my iPad at Verizon. No problem. There’s no interest!” I ask “well do you really use the LTE on it?” They say no. And I say well. You paid $130 more for the LTE version and a data fee every month all so you could get it sooner. Not a great deal. 

Depends on the person, but I’d say in general MOST people are not responsible and only get it on payments because they can’t delay gratification. Saving up is always a better deal for the consumer in the long run


Exactly, I'm and idiot and will probably fall for it lol


On if you already had that type of plan years ago. Jump is no longer available.


Ah ok. Thanks


They don’t do it to be nice, they do it because the data shows a very high percentage won’t make every single payment on time or will pay minimums and not pay in full before the interest kicks in. At that point you get back-dated interest to the start of the payment plan.

If you’re thinking about putting a $400 depreciating luxury item on a credit payment plan. Don’t.


I’d want the extended warranty provided by my credit card


Sorry, should have clarified: Apple Card could be worthwhile for those who pay things off over time. I pay my cards off in full each month, so there is no interest on them.


Apple has less than 5% global share in the PC market and 10% phone share, and those numbers have been falling for the last 3 years. I'm here in this sub because I was once full apple ecosystem, but that's changed in the last couple of years.


Depending on who which site you look at, the number of iPhones sold this year are 8-15% less than they were last year. And that figure was down 10%+ on 2018 figures. As I've said in other comments, it's on its way down and I believe it's to do with their pricing structure. 

I think especially in the current climate, people are definitely considering alternatives to iPhones, which is why I think this Apple Card/financing system is coming into place so quickly, to try and entice people back into the apple ecosystem by spreading the costs out of their devices.


Do you think it would be charged monthly or do I have to carry the whole price until it’s paid off.?


I’m almost certain it already did.


Because I have 4 credit cards already.


Ah The sweet sweet smell of consumerism.


Just contact their customer service. I’ve used the 0% interest in an Apple TV and it was like 200 😝


They run promotions on a regular basis (or at least used to), but you can often call and see if they can add a promotion to your account. It never hurts to ask.


That’s not true. 

I’ve used it three times now since opening my card in April of last year. Both at Christmas and spring of this year I got additional promotional emails from them for the same promotion I got when first opening the card.


I’ve called them to get promotional pricing reinstated before


I’ve had the Barclay Apple rewards card since 2010. Use it to buy all my apple products. Interest free on Apple products still works. Bought the 11 on this card and all have that payment due next April. Otherwise usually have one or two apple purchases per year on this card. All deferred interest.


Over the past 7 or 8 years used it for an iMac, a 13" Mac book pro, and 2 or 3 iPhones. They run promotions every so often and have taken advantage of them if there was something I was planning to buy, and if they aren't running a promotion you can call to ask to have it added. Always paid it off in 16 months (on 18 month terms) because I'm paranoid... zero interest.


They probably vary whether they send promotions to people based on if they are using their card or not. 

A family member of mine never uses theirs and gets promotions all the time. Since you were using your card regularly, maybe you weren’t targeted for their promotional advertising 🤷‍♂️

Often times you can call customer service and ask for one.


I got a Barclays card once and ended up cancelling it. I have a really good credit score and their interest rates are shit.


I used the one-time promotion at least three times before eventually closing the card. I just kept calling them up and telling them I wanted to make a big purchase and they’d activate the offer again.

I never used the card otherwise, but those offers were great.


I have two different metal cards. It’s anecdotal, but I’ve had more issues with their strips demagnetizing. Don’t know if it’s because they go through airport xrays a lot.


Not every time though unless I’m missing something. I see they rotate between 12 month (standard) and run promotions for 18 and every once in a while 24 months.


The apple branded Barclay card I have (which may no longer be available) offered 3% back on apple purchases (the catch was it was in the form of Apple Store credit or iTunes gift cards, and the iTunes cards are great because they pay for my Apple Music. The biggest catch is you can only redeem once you saved up enough for a $25 card).


Had the card for around 8 years. Over that time I've bought an iMac, a Mac Book Pro, and 2 or three iPhones each using a 0% interest promotion Barclay offered (or having called and asked for the promotion).


You do. And then they offered another "buy an apple product before June 30th and get 0% off for 6 months on a 12 months for any product over $1000 or 18 months for over $1500" (or insert other date, and I'm not exactly certain on the tiers of months/price but it was something like that, maybe a $250 for 6 months as well?) every so often, and if they weren't offering a promotion you could call customer service and ask "hey I'm thinking of buying a $1500 item at apple, are there any zero interest promotions available to me?"

You couldn't just walk into a store and buy a product and expect the 0%, but as I said, I've purchased several larger ticket items over the past 8 years and got 0% multiple times.


I’ve had it for 6 years and they just bumped me up to $6,500 limit. Seems to just take some time. 

And for other folks asking, I regularly get 0% interest promo for Apple products as well. Biggest reason I haven’t needed to apply for the Apple Card.


I had one device I wanted to buy that was over my limit, called them and explained, they bumped my credit


I get 3% back from Barclay in terms of iTunes credit, which saves me that much money on my Apple Mysic, which is real money.


I’ve stated in about 5 other comments that they’d regularly offer additional promotional periods quite regularly or you could call and ask for one.


Yes it's a initial promotion, but Barclays has regularly offered subsequent promotions for the same value (6/12/18 mo 0% depending on the cost of the purchase) at various times, and I've also called customer support to see if they can add the promotion to my account when I wanted to make a purchase. Over the past 8 years I've bought an iMac, MacBook Pro, an iPad Pro, and 2 or 3 iPhones all for 0 interest on the Barclay card.


Apparently. I really got tired of people flooding my inbox with variations on a theme:

I’ve done it 3 or 4 times without issue. I do always pay off the amount at about 16 months because I’m well aware of retroactive interest scams.


Yeah, I finally upgraded from a 2011 mini that I had pimped out, because it no longer supported OS upgrades, to last year’s iMac model right after it was announced. However it still doesn’t have T2 and there’s talk of the next model using Apple chips. 

I could see the program being something like “own in 5 years, upgrade in 2 and a half.” If it’s 0% on an Apple Card, that could make a real, quality Mac very possibly attainable for a lot of people.


I assume Apple didn’t want it competitive with their own card.


“Purchases made at apple.com, Apple Stores or 1-800-MY-APPLE and billed to your account during the offer period qualify for the special financing offer. For newly opened accounts, the *offer period is for the first 30 days after account opening*. iTunes purchases do not qualify for deferred interest financing.”

https://www.barclaycardus.com/apply/action/handleFile?id=appleFaqForwardUrl

This first 30 days clause shows up in several places, including Apple’s own website.

I personally have never received a recurring offer since opening the card back in 2015. It was explained to me back then that it was just for new cardholders. That said, I’d believe you with proof that you’ve had a different experience.


You can reportedly also ask them to give it to you when it’s not currently being offered if some posts I’ve read in the past are to be believed.


We don’t have the Apple card in the U.K. we have Barclays but I don’t think they do finance on education store on Apple


Yep. Say you have a $1 mil home. If you could get something stupid like a 2% interest rate, take the 30 year loan.

You now have $1 mil you could potentially turn into 4-5%/year in gains.

On top of that the interest you pay on said loan is tax deductible 😂


And be in debt for another product! Yay!

Seriously, save for it outright and not in installments. Debt does two things: increases risk, and increases stress.


Not that you’re ducking missing much


That just blew my mind. I knew it wasn't available in many places, but ... 4? Why does this thing even exist?


You're talking like adding debt is the more secure option... In case of surprises I think having the fewest amount of debt possible is the better situation.


That's not more affordable because of a plan, you pay the same price. If you can't set aside 700 in 2 or 3 months you're not in a good place financially (and it's not about income, people with high income can also live day to day). Adding debt is therefore not a good idea.


You’re welcome! It could be worth asking for a credit limit increase if you want to do that. Before they were done manually, but now they’re done automatically. I got mine day of and saw a lot of people are getting that, too.


Because you’ve utilized $2400 of your credit to buy the MacBook. You’re charged the full amount up front so your balance is the full amount; you’ve utilized the $2400 of your credit limit. You just get 12 months to slowly pay down that amount.


Because you're using up 2400 out of 3000 credit. Utilization is how much credit you've depleted, not what you pay.


Really? That’s different than every card I’ve ever applied to.


Interesting statement. I wonder if we will see cheaper MacBooks in direct person to person sales for people just needing to sell because of money mismanagement.


Doesn’t Apple Card still give you 3-5% back at Apple store?


3% is cool but I’ll take AmEx’s 1% and their extra year of warranty coverage instead.


The OP was talking about finally being able to afford it because of the payment plan. That’s very different than budgeting. Even then not being able to budget a couple of grand over the course of 9 years is pathetic.

It’s better to not tie up savings at once if you can help it.


I only pay $10 a month


Dave Ramsay is only good for people who are terrible with money. He’s like the financial version of a rehab center. For people who are good with money he gives terrible advice.


Who isn’t using LTE at this point?


Nope you can start today.  You have to do it over tforce (Twitter PM @tmobilehelp). I just confirmed with them you can start today.


It’s good advice for the majority, but doesn’t mean this isn’t helpful for those who can afford it but don’t want to drop the money all at once.


In addition there are many people who will upgrade early/more often with this available. So more sales too.


It’s a good deal. You save money to inflation and the earnings of the money you’re not having to tie up at once.


Market share has always been completely irreverent and always has been. It’s about profit and overall sales. Apple just sold 20 million iphone 11’s in Q1. Apple aren’t struggling to sell devices at all. PC? Yeah sure that’s on the decline as in the end they will be faded out in 5-10 years.


Classify the iPad line as personal computers and re-do your analysis of global share.


You keep repeating a lie for some reason. No matter how many times you repeat it it won’t make it true. 

2016- 211 million iPhones sold
2017 - 216 million
2018 - 217 million
2019- 203 million (estimated)


Basically everybody has iPhones and/or AirPods at least, you can’t say “no one buys their devices”


They haven’t released the feature to pay monthly interest free yet. I’m not sure I understand your question.


That’s a fuckin’ bummer.


Having more accounts (responsibly used) is good for your credit score long term.


That’s it? You need more.

Son welcome to r/churning

4? Those are rookie numbers.


Cool thanks.


I never got one. No promotional nothing.


It might be, I’d honestly just add the card to Apple Pay and keep it at home. I keep a thin wallet, but it’s still sexy


I guess they don’t do that card anymore. I bought a MBP last month and the Barclay card I got still differs interest for 18 months but doesn’t have any Apple branding or rewards system as far as I can tell.


Oh wow. That’s good to know. Thanks!


True, different strokes for different folks. With those points though you’re limited to what you can redeem, with the Apple Card you can use it on whatever you’d like.


Huh. TIL. Thanks for the info!


I was planning on buying my 16in MBP with the Barclays card, but after reading so many negative reviews, especially for the customer service, I got scared and decided to wait for the cash flow I was waiting for. Plus I want a credit card I can stay wait, not one I'll use just for one purchase and then cancel it because it's a bad card.


I have a the card and have financed a MacBook Pro, iPhone and Apple Watch using it. 

I also get emails from them occasionally. 

https://i.imgur.com/V8sMJS0.jpg 


https://i.imgur.com/IJEcIhw.jpg

These emails are six months apart for example and I got the card in mid 2017. 

It definitely applies within the first thirty days but keeps appearing here and there without you knowing often. I’ve bought stuff like a charger or a watch band from the Apple store and they got enrolled in this program.


Learned this the hard way and have had this useless account opened ever since.


It’s always on as far as I can tell. Even if you don’t have the offer you can call and they’ll give it to you. I’ve done this 2 times.


Must be different where you are that doesn’t make it more affordable then. The price per month is cheaper to buy directly from the manufacturer than it is from the carrier, especially in Canada, as they increase the price in general. IF the option to buy from a manufacturer was there, people would use it because it’s more affordable, the major three carriers love their Sky high data prices and when they make it harder to find a reason to switch to another carrier (like only “financing” because of a plan) it makes having phones unlocked from the factory useless because it invalidates the usefulness of actually having an unlocked phone


Wait what is done automatically CLI’s?


[deleted]


Doubtful. As long as there’s been credit cards there’s been people that mismanage them. There won’t be any more uptick in them than there already is.

I don’t play games it would be for normal every day browsing, documents and video editing


Yup. *crosses fingers*


Well that’s good at least


Do you feel its worth it? I had an LTE ipad and almost never used the LTE part of it. The few times i did i just tethered to my phone


Ramsay’s basics;

-pay off debt

-have an emergency fund

-invest in wealth accumulating assets

Pretty good advice to me. Is there anybody that wouldn’t be good for? And how does it benefit anyone to be tied to a 24 month commitment especially in these uncertain times? Versus saving up for a couple months and having a fully paid for product. Which also frees your income stream for other things. Like investments that grow your money


On their iPad? Quite a few apparently. I’m talking to people on Mac rumors and it’s a normal thing for people to buy an expensive iPad on payments with their carrier just to get it sooner.


You technically save an extra ~2% depending on inflation over that year as well


If you look at the numbers, it’s not a good deal (broadly speaking). Trying to save against inflation over a six month period is nothing compared to having to pay 24% interest. Obviously some will be disciplined enough to “take advantage” of the offer but the overwhelming majority will not. For most people it’s a bad idea, consumer electronics should never be financed through “same as cash” offers.

These offers only exist for one reason: they’re extremely lucrative. This isn’t Apple extending you a gift.


20 million iPhones in a world with 3 billion mobile users though? And how many of those were new-to-iphone users? Or were they just replacing their a large proportion of their user base's fleet of devices?

I do think pricing has a lot to do with the decline in iPhone users over the last few years.

I love Apple, it's why I'm here, but I see them losing support for a lot of apps etc over the next few years as their base gets smaller and smaller.


I could, but they aren't though are they. Maybe in a year or two they'll be on par, but they aren't yet.


Those things ain't personal computers. lol I've had 2 iPad Pros, and that's the last thing I'd call them.


In the US, sure. The US is the only place in the world where apple have a majority share. Have you ever looked at the composition of mobile users worldwide? Same with personal computer users. Apple is on a slope right now, whether you love their products or not. I say this as a former FULL Apple ecosystem of devices user


That moment when you realize a credit score is absolutely useless in the long term.


My credit score is considered exceptional.


Don’t even churn and I have like 12 CCs, cus why not.


Another card for someone to steal or hack, another thing to monitor. There is zero benefit. And don't say "but more cards raise your credit score" my score is considered exceptional, it doesn't get much higher and there is no benefit.


True, but I have an Apple Music subscription, so if I use the money there, it translates to real money saved.


I mean, there’s not really any reason to cancel. I only use it once every few years for financing.


Every credit card has terrible 1-star reviews from people who were “wronged”


That’s really cool; I’ve never received that offer (or any beyond the first purchase), but I also haven’t used it frequently in a long time.

Glad you’ve had those, though! They should talk that up more.


I hate that card, and can't even close it because it will hurt my credit.


Do you mean you can't go to an Apple Store and just buy a device there?


Yes. They might some algorithm to help them determine what the increase should be because it seems it’s done day-of now for a lot of people.


It’s not really weird. All internal banks can see your credit. Goldman just agreed to do this up front, probably to be able to work with Apple and get a lot of new customers using their card


[deleted]


You always have the two week window to be able to return anything that you don’t end up liking and get your full money back


Yeah I barely use my iPad at home so it’s worth it not to tether. Also the iPad makes for a great tether device for my MacBook because the iPad has a giant battery in it and can tether all day long.


He’s against credit cards and all debt except mortgages. Credit cards are useful tools and so is debt. They can certainly be misused but they can also be employed to increase gains. 

>	And how does it benefit anyone to be tied to a 24 month commitment especially in these uncertain times? Versus saving up for a couple minutes and having a fully paid for product. Which also frees your income stream for other things. Like investments that grow your money

You’re better off investing the money and paying for the item in an interest free loan. Inflation reduces the overall cost of the item and the money can earn interest instead of being paid at once. 

Ramsey is “good enough” but it’s by no means the optimal financial advice. I only steer people there who lack financial discipline.


It’s interest free...


Uh oh, there’s that lie again.


But iPads are personal computers, aren’t they.  

Please cite a $329 device which you are willing to argue to be more of a personal computer than an iPad.  

Maybe you’re thinking of the Lenovo Chromebook Duet?


I’m in England, iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches everywhere you look here


What? A great credit score can save you thousands in interest. It’s far from useless.


A credit score is useful when you need credit.


No need to flex, sir      /s. (For real though, good job!)


That’s fine, but 4 cards is a very low number.


In my experience, the once or twice you miss paying in full will likely offset any gains. Any reason to get so many Ccs?


Is your score exceptional or just average?


They really should. Actually you can call barclaycard and ask if the offer is on your card right now and request them to activate it if it isn’t.


FYI, I’ve actually contacted them by phone asking them to add deferred interest to my next purchase and they did so without question twice with about 2 years in between each request.


People never expect good things to happen to them.... that’s why Apple is the most profitable company in the world


Same my friend, same. It’s my most useless card. They sent me a letter the other day saying if I did not use it within 30 days they would cancel me. I didn’t know if that would hurt my credit or not, so I bought a bag of chips with it. Then, while going online to pay off the chips I saw the section for increasing my limit. I applied and got it. Dunno why I did that, I don’t play on using it. Sigh.


*with financing

Does it come with you also 😉

🤫


I see you’re line of thinking here but. If you go with the average price of the iPad it’s what. Maybe $700? 8? What kind of return would you get on such a small investment that would make the effort worth it? And are everyday people who just work a standard 9 to 5 going to be worrying about investing anyway? Especially on such a small scale.


It’s interest free if you meet every stipulation in the fine print, make every payment on time, and pay it off within the given time frame (differs by product). If not they backdate interest to the date of purchase and continue charging more interest going forward. Obviously some will be disciplined enough to do this but the offers only exist because most aren’t. This is how all “same as cash” deals work.


They are personal devices, and computers, but they don't have the complete functionality of a personal computer yet, and I think we both know that. 

Apple are working hard on it, I can see that. But they are missing a huge amount of compatibility with software packages, and in that, a lot of usefulness. iPad still suffers from a huge lack of application support, with many 3rd party developers putting on a watered down version of a complete program. 

Here you go, here's a number of devices that I consider to be more of a personal computer than an iPad. 

https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/all-laptop-computers/3944_3951_1089430_132960?cat_id=3944_3951_1089430_132960&page=1&sort=price_low


I'm in England too, and not really. iPhones key sales demographics are non-power users, and they've slowly been pushed out of the business phone market. 

Airpods are popular, sure. But they aren't all you can see. In fact now that there's no aux jack on many new phones I see a much wider array of headphones by 3rd party manufacturers. Beats, Samsung, Bose, Sony etc. 

You are right to criticise my use of "nobody buys" because it's not true. I apologise. But when compared with sales of the other major phone type, it's certainly a bleak outlook for the iPhone.


I only have one, with a 790 score.
Not sure why people card collect.

It’s no wonder the american dream is under a pile of debt.


Lmao look at his other (now deleted) comments. He takes his credit score seriously.


It took me a long time to get there. It probably helps that I'm likely a little older than the average Redditor.


You said that's fine, but you also told me more accounts is good for your credit score. That doesn't do me any good, because it's already close to maxed out.

I'm not a Pokemon trainer. I don't need every card.

Adding more cards won't raise my credit score. I'm optimized for points in places I regularly buy. To me more cards are just another bill that is a chance to accidentally miss a payment on or to get hacked. I've done very well juggling my finances for the nearly 25 years I've had credit and have never missed a payment. And churning seems like a lot of time and energy for modest gains.


[deleted]


You have to be extremely disciplined and be 100% certain you can have everything under control. If so, there’s plenty of money to be made


People who can’t pay in full should not be getting credit cards and spending for sign up bonuses. It’s not worth the risk or reward like you said.

Autopay take cares of all your cards so you don’t screw it up.


In my experience, I set them all to autopay and never miss a payment.


Pay them off in full.


Set all of them for autopay and you never have to think about missing a payment. Keeping these cards active means the credit line is huge and as a result utilization is under 5% which is a plus on your credit score. And because it’s large, if you ever have some larger emergency payment or month you spent a lot e.g. a vacation you were saving for, then it does not impact utilization much at all.

I only use 1 card at a time. All the others are on my Apple Pay and just use them once a year to buy something small under $10 so the bank sees it as active and does not close it. And as mentioned earlier autopay takes care of those small payments.


Every card has automatic pay in full for each month. I don’t overspend, so usually everything is easy to maintain. When I use something like the Amazon card to get a period with no interest, I distribute automatic payments to be paid off at least 1 month prior end of offer.

At this day in age, it’s convenient having an app for all the cards so makes it easy to check any day and any time.


Because you like living on the edge...


[removed]


Same, that card has like 20% interest, like it's not worth it at all. I used it because I was young and dumb. Now I'm just buy one single thing with it per month and paying it off a week later.


Well, we're back on the beginning then, imo it's much better and safer to avoid consumer debt, especially for small expenses (I can understand how it's more difficult for a car).


Meant to say all banks internally can check your credit score. You’re overthinking this. They simply agree to check your credit to say yes or no risk free because the benefits outweigh any costs or logistical particulars with running it. And nothing shows up on your credit report from any of this unless you open the card. Period. 

“Your credit score won't be impacted if you're declined, or don't accept your offer. Your credit score might be impacted if your application is approved and you accept your offer.“

The effort? It takes me no effort. It’s literally going to be the difference between clicking an extra button or two when completing the payment options. Any return would make it worth it. But to answer your question, an expected 7%-9% return on top of the 2% return from inflation being on my side. Realistically about 5% when it’s all added up and the monthly payments are taken into account.


I disagree with your statement that “most” don’t pay it on time. I will gladly read any evidence you have to support this claim though and reconsider my stance.

Phone companies provide this same service. Not because they expect people to default. But because it increases customers and locks people in long term.


>	they don’t have the complete functionality of a personal computer yet, and I think we both know that.

They have the complete functionality of a desktop or laptop required by millions of users, and a superior experience, and I think we both know that.  

I think we both know that they are personal computers running an appropriately crafted branch of Free BSD, and that you are reluctant to re-do your analysis because the results would not support your narrative.


>	Here you go, here's a number of devices that I consider to be more of a personal computer than an iPad.

So you *do* consider the Chromebook a personal computer.  

It is on your list:  

ASUS C423 14" Celeron 4GB/64GB Chromebook, 14" HD Nano-Edge Display, Intel Celeron N3350, 4GB DDR4, 64GB eMMC, Chrome OS, C423NA-WB04  

Your claim that the ChromeBook is not “missing a huge amount of compatibility with software packages” suggests you are practicing advocacy, not discussion.


Mostly all I can see when I’m out, obviously not ALL I can see, but it’s very definitely the majority


According to Statista, the 2019 iPhone market share in the U.K. is 49.24% - that’s higher that the US at 45%.

And apart from a high point blip in 2018 where it went over 50%, it’s been increasing year on year.


Having credit cards does not equal debt to everyone. I have 5, all for different point systems.  I make money off of credit cards.


You do realize your score isn't the only thing that matters when getting a loan right? The first time I tried to get approved for a car loan when I was young and had a 770 credit score nobody approved me because of my lack of history / multiple accounts. A year later after working on it I had no issues getting 2.9% on a used car.


Comments are for everyone that reads them, not just you. I don’t care how many cards you have.


This is a lot for a Sunday morning lmao


My Sapphire Reserve card has served me very well (I spend a lot on travel), the Barclay card has been better for Apple things, my Amazon card is just for Amazon/Whole Foods purchases... but after that I haven't found anything else that I find worth it.


Thanks for the insight


Exactly. When I first started, I was off to a good start. But, with no savings and some months unemployed after college, my bills started to stack with me hitting just the minimum payments. Finally, I got a steady job and I’ve been saving at the beginning of each month for me to make my payments at the end of each month. With my plan, I was CC debt free in 1.5 years!  
  
One of the things I learned is that its better to make a pay-off plan you stick to than to pay off debt in lump sums when you have cash on hand. Though you may save on some interest, it’s bad for unforeseen expenses. Once you’re debt free, it’s like you said. Discipline and, in my case, monthly reminders on my phone/calendar!


Thanks, any strategies you follow?


Exactly. I have basically one card for every category, and I’ve definitely made $1500-2000+ (that otherwise wouldn’t have been made if I used my debit card, of course) from sign up bonuses and cashback over the past three years without paying any interest. Definitely easy to fall behind if you don’t pay them down immediately, though.


It’s fairly easy to manage when everything has apps and you can set notifications and reminders for paying off your balance every month. Or if you trust yourself enough spend normally and responsibly without checking everything, you can just set your auto-pay on and never think about them at all


I have a near perfect credit record. The only times in 25 years of credit history that I missed a payment or bounced a check were when autopay screwed me over by not taking the money or by taking an extra payment after a loan was completely paid off, or on occasion me forgetting to update the expiration date when I got a new card. I’ve been burned more than once, so I tend to avoid autopay.


Idk, that doesn’t scream exceptional to me.


Ah, well that’s your opinion and it means nothing. It’s your opinion and it may be good for you and nobody else in the world. 

Paying $1500 for a phone (how much it is outright) for a phone makes less financial sense than $30 a month. 

Yes there’s cheaper options but when it comes to longevity, cheaper makes less sense. 
Paying $700 for the new non flagship android is great and all but they don’t last, if there’s a bug they may never fix it or it will take many months and that’s always been the death of every single android phone I’ve ever had. 

That’s my shitty opinion, which to others may make less sense to them than yours does to me. But different countries and different financial backgrounds make getting things easier or harder for different people.

Oh shit I thought you were a dude. Aight I’m outta here


Curious if I can ask a personal question? Are you investing right now? In what?


The [Money Crashers](https://www.moneycrashers.com/stay-away-from-the-90-days-same-as-cash-trap/#) say 80% fail to pay on time while Dave Ramsey (personal finance guru with a syndicated radio show) says its 88%. Numbers vary slightly based on who you ask but the percentage is very high.

It also just makes sense logically: 

Who fronts the money to Apple on this “deal”? A bank (Goldman Sachs who runs the Apple Card program). 

How do banks make money? They charge interest on loans. 

Would a bank stay in business long giving out interest-free loans they made nothing on? No. 

Would a bank create a program that caused them to lose money? No. 

Is there a good chance that many people are failing to meet the terms and converting their purchase into a paid financing plan? Yes.


Fair point, but whilst we might see them as common, the world market, and the sales of the last 3-4 years indicates we are seeing the end of the iPhone as the dominating presence in the phone world


Anecdotal evidence doesn’t support your claim.

The fact that nationwide , Americans are drowning in CC debt does support my claim.

Credit cards are a bottomless pit, and very very wealthy people seldom have more than 2.
Some even just have 1.

So for anyone with sanity reading my post thinking of applying for another CC, don’t join the rat pack and get 4-7 CC’s because one 1-7 people downvoting me have anecdotal evidence supporting baseless arguments.

Cheers!


I also have the SR and Amazon cards, which account the majority of my spending (SR for food, Amazon for online purchases).  The Apple Card still presents a decent deal for me because I use it at grocery stores and also the cafe at the office, which gives me 2% I wasn’t getting at all before, and also to pay for my monthly subscriptions to Apple for iCloud storage, a few apps, and Apple Music for 3% back.  The only other card I use regularly is my Costco Visa for gas (4% at any station) and my infrequent Costco trips.


Random store cards can be useful if you’re making a large purchase to get 0% interest financing offers


There are some gas cards that offer 5% back. Look em up online. I wanna day one is called ducks unlimited.


I take it one step further with a discipline. And every day before I go to bed, I login and pay my credit card bill. Every, single, day.


If you want churning related strategies (which credit cards, which bonuses etc) I would check churning

If you want tips on being responsible, treat it like a debit card (don’t buy more than you can afford, pay off the full balance on time) and don’t get comfortable with carrying a high balance or splurging.

I keep an excel spreadsheet that tracks all the awards I’ve earned and fees I’ve paid to make sure I’m coming out on top


There’s no one size fits all approach. Get a card that’s applicable to your lifestyle. For example, I travel a lot and am loyal to the Marriott brand. So I opened a Marriott branded card where I get a free night every year and put enough on the card for the sign up bonus that more than makes up for the annual fee. I also have the platinum American Express cards where the points, perks, and benefits offsets the annual fee and I have the added bonus of free delta lounge access when I fly. I haven’t paid for a vacation in years. All that made sense in a pre-covid world and less so now.


In terms of keeping discipline?

Use it like it's your debit card. Don't buy anything you can't afford. Pay it off every week. You can use websites like Mint to view all your card accounts at once. I login a few times a week to keep an eye on all my balances.


I recommend a budgeting software like YNAB to keep track. This will allow you to easily see if you are over spending.


My bank didn’t have a autopay for my car loan so I did it every month. But I have never had an issue with credit card autopay. I tend to payoff even before I get a statement so it’s just like for safety in case I miss it.


Credit scores over 800 are considered excellent.


Yeah, more like excellent. Exceptional is like 850 /s


"That's your opinion and it means nothing and here's my opinion but it means nothing as well, but let's discuss them".


I am talking about the customer. They can apply risk free and it only impacts their credit if they open up the card. I’m sure the bank has costs to run this check. They just agreed to cover this because the benefits(new customers and a relationship with Apple that can pay off in the future in other ventures and projects) outweigh these costs

Why do you ask?


I’m curious what the percentages are in the tech sector. This is hardly new. Like I said, wireless providers have provided this service for years and I’d never heard of people having problems with those phone payments to a high degree. 

>	How do banks make money? They charge interest on loans.

They also make money through processing fees they charge per swipe. Presumably they are going to charge Apple something in order to provide this special deal as well since this is being done as a collaboration.


That’s not limited to the iPhone though, it’s not the latest iPhones I see everywhere, I see a lot of 6 and 6s models too, as you’re aware, not disputing your research on market indications, my issue was with your statement “No one buys your devices” when it’s evidently the opposite


Just a touchscreen MacBook at this point


Fantastic tool for digital artist! That’s all I can say now.


Would be cool if iPads had access to command line, macOS apps, games etc… but honestly what is the point of this? Maybe if you use your iPad for video editing, but at that point why not just get a Mac because of better software. I just don’t see the value other than future proofing


For people asking who needs this, I make my entire webcomic on Clip Studio Paint EX on my 12.9" iPad Pro from 2017. My drawing area gets tight if I have CSP and another app open at the same time, so this sounds perfect for me. I much prefer the feeling of drawing on an iPad than on any other tablet I've tried. Since bezels are smaller these days I imagine the 14.1" won't feel much bigger than my old 12.9" (which is over 14" incl. the bezels).


I’m an artist, and the pro is my main machine. Never thought an iPad would be my main tool, but the form factor is perfect for what I do and how I live. I’m assuming that they’ll be unveiling some actual pro apps (I’ve been waiting on tenterhooks for Logic Pro, and it’s been expected for years now. If the bigger form factor is coupled with the release of Logic, I’ll be upgrading several years before I expected to…


I would buy this instantly. I need more room for sketching.


This is what I’m waiting for. I have 100mp photos I want to work on smoothly with an iPad. The current pro version does it but I’m thrilled to see the m2 and a 14 inch!!! Saving my doll hairs now


Is this surprising? Seems like a sensible evolution of an existing product


Gonna look like the Pear Pad from Victorious


This is going to be fantastic for digital artists  🤤


Ah, the thing that may finally convince me to upgrade my gen1 iPad Pro


I have the 2020 iPad Pro and literally everything only use it to draw with or edit photos. That’s about it. I could not imagine needing a m2 chip in that thing.


at this point they're just asking for more and more money on overkill specs for an operating system that can't do basic computing.


I use the Samsung Tab S8 Ultra, I can confirm: size matters


Way too big


This just in: Apple is working on a new Mac Pro with M2 Ultra. Word on the street is that they're also considering launching iPhone 14 this fall.

All of these statements are obvious to anyone who's kept up with Apple.


Breaking news IPad maker working on iPads.


What’s the point if they keep limiting the OS? Make the desktop apps available for it. Apple should stop acting like it is some special in between system. It should be the touch screen version of macOS.

Edit: iOS to macOS.


Will it bend?


How reliable


If apple developed everything sources said....


Buy why?


Case manufacturers: NOOoOOooo


Rumor: 16 inch version to be called the iPad Maxi.


Why’s when apple upgrades their stuff it’s news. Wtf were they supposed to do put older chips in it?


Why can’t people just wait till release to get all the scoop instead of all this rumour this rumour that bullshit


I cannot even muster a quarter of a fuck to give


A lot of people discount iPads as Netflix watching devices and have no idea how they are used by professionals. There’s a market for a giant iPad.


Well, duh.


Next generation news headline : apple developing 14.3 inch iPad Pro with M3 chip, two sources will claim. 

Duh


Without pro apps I don’t understand who this is for


No one cares until you let it run big work load apps like final cut and others


Meanwhile all the artists just came together simultaneously.


I’ve been wanting a bigger iPad for years, but this is such a strange upgrade in size. Unless they’re straight-up replacing the 13 inch iPad Pro, why would they offer an option that’s only 1 inch bigger? 13 inches is already perfect for pretty much everyone. The only people wanting bigger iPads are usually artists like myself, and I say that if apple really wants to appeal to those people, they might as well make a Cintiq-like drawing tablet of their own. Make a 20 inch iPad that can be stationed on a desk! It would be beautiful, could still be portable, and could pair well with a desktop set-up


But why


So it’s like a MacBook? But with way way less functionality because it’s tied to iOS App Store


If it can run MacOS apps, I’m in. If not, no thanks.


For 8k


So…. a laptop….


This is awesome, designers need this!


I don’t care, GIVE IT MAC OS FOR FUCK SAKE.


M1 is overkill in Ipad - so why are they putting m2 is just marketing gimmick. If apple allow users to install macosx - then yeah , it makes a lot difference .


I haven’t seen someone use an iPad for what seems like ten years. Do people even buy these things anymore? I don’t see their purpose for personal use.


My grandma will be so excited.


It seems two type of people in comments. People who are frustrated about how limited the iPad pro is and others who don't understand why other's are frustrated lol. Hint: if ipad pro was half price, no one would complain. But to get it with equivalent storage, magic keyboard, it costs way more than a basic macbook with WAY less functionality when in reality, it actually could provide all the functionality. People basically getting robbed for what they paid for, when apple just waiting to see how long they can keep this charade up until inevitably merging both.


This is huge! Like literally big.


I am guessing the new iPad OS will actually be able to utilize all the power of the M2 and the corresponding memory?

I know the OS right now can’t even utilize the current M1 and mem capabilities.


Too dam big I need a tablet not a monitor


I might be missing some master stroke of business decision. But, from a glance, I can’t help thinking this device is near useless. Who exactly does this iPad serve? It has all the power of a Macbook, but limited by a less useful iPad OS. Aren’t the iPad use cases already covered by the much cheaper iPad Air, and the Macbook use cases already covered by the Macbook???


This will make a great pad for my PC gaming mouse.


And amazingly affordable at $2500 I’m sure


Just buy a laptop at this point.


What is the point if the app store doesn't have apps making full use of the power?


Oh, good. Just in time for them to fuck us on the trade in value on the 2020 that we paid $1200 for.

I’m usually all about Apple, but they really fucked everyone who shelled out for the “Pro”.


This iPad doesn’t Jiggle Jiggle…. It folds.


Is there any point if it isn’t running OSX ?


Breaking news... Apple is developing a new M3 processor!


Can they install MacOs on it plz?


Finally, an actually somewhat decent use for the M chips


If it cant run native macos then who gives an F. I love my 2020 ipad pro, and am able to do a lot of illustration/design and some video work on it. But why make the Pros bigger and more powerful if they’re still stuck with ipados and ipad apps?


Yes! This sounds great. My first iPad Pro changed my life artistically speaking… I can make music, I can make art, I can make videos, all to my liking. But super powerful and with more screen??? I’m going to start saving. I need this.


Making giant tablets for niche audiences but they kill the iPhone mini? Sad world.


iPad OS continues to suck. Until they make it work like MacOS on the iPad, the iPad will only be a consumption or artists device for creativity. They have otherwise ruined the iPad. Even the new iPadOS sucks and only has one better feature for multitasking but they just cannot figure it out and it only works with M1 iPads. I am don’t spending money on iPads and expecting to get anything done with them other than reading or watching Netflix. The keyboard situation sucks even with the floating style as has to be so heavy to do anything. I think the only option now is to just put MacOS on the iPad Pro and allow Pro users to dual boot. Or run both natively at the same time. 

Apple has lost the vision with the iPad Pro. So much money for such little software capabilities. It makes buying even the cheapest MacBook Air a much much higher value proposition. Maybe like 50x better for similar price. I do think for $249 on sale the basic iPad is good at watching videos and traveling with. Don’t have to worry about damage to it or anything for $249 and can just use it for what it is. With a basic case with keyboard can even send emails and use as on the road simple work device. But still not good at much else. 

Too bad they don’t have a product person in charge of the company. Tim Cook really misses the big picture except the big picture for investors which is money. Good at making money but he’s horrible at shipping great products with great software as he just limits the designers and engineers creativity so much. Sad days.


Won't even matter until they unlock iPadOS.


Man, I bought the 10 inch iPad because the 12 inch was too big. Now a 14.1 inch? Wtf?


Is there a market for this, seriously ?

I prefer they’d focus on the existing line-up for instance M2 and mini-led for the 11’ because it’s increasingly hard to justify the 11 inch pro in place of the new ipad air 5.

The OS is just not there to fully exploit a 14 inch ipad tbh


How surprising.


In two years.. you will have to get a 19" iPad Pro, completely defeating the purpose of having useful mobile tablets.


Too big.  No interest.


I was hoping as a 6E wifi router owner that we would see 6E devices with M2 launch. Now I’m scared apple is just skipping the standard


still have my 10.1" ipad pro from early 2018. still use it all day long and it's just as capable/productive in my everyday activities as ever. 

what would i do with another 4 inches? lmao


ELIF please.


Why?

It’s gonna have a price tag of like $1500. For that price it’s just easier and cheaper to buy MacBook Pro and have FULL usability. I’ve used an iPad and a MacBook, and unless you’re a nurse or a graphic designer, I’d choose MacBook anytime. And even if you do need an iPad, why pro? Air will take notes just fine for $300-400 less


I’m probably gonna hold off on buying an iPad until this comes out then. Cause I’m an artist and have been looking at getting an iPad for a while now but I’ll always take more screen real estate. But I’m sure it’ll start at like $1,300 and have a $350 keyboard and $120 pencil. This is going to really start adding up lol


I hate these fucking titles, like no shit they probably are.. like the new m2 is the newest chip. Why wouldn’t they fucking make a new iPad with it??


They need to develop the iMac with the m2 and start selling that shit. I want a new one but I sure as hell am not going to buy an M1 at this point


Developing doesn’t mean release. It’s been an apple thing to use old processors in iPad, probably won’t be seen maybe two years from now. I doubt they would risk their MacBook sales number to iPad, literally meant cannibalism.


No one uses iPads


Who cares!!


What’s .1 of an inch? 63/64th?


Omg yes please. I want this!!! Also an Apple pencil 3 with hover support


People who don’t understand why just don’t have a need for it. iPads and Apple pencils are creative designers wet dreams and they require good processing power especially when working on animations.


That’s a pretty sweet “new sized bottle” they got there.

https://youtu.be/NlBjNmXvqIM


Well it’s handy if you draw alot or other technical drawing.. Stuff.

&#x200B;

But I have an iPad Pro (typing this on it) but I’d much prefer an iPad mini at this point considering the limited way I end up using it.

aka games, p\*rn, browsing Reddit And the odd movie/ video Like YouTube etc.

&#x200B;

You don’t need a 12+ inch screen for that and gets uncomfy in bed.


Just a large iPhone with limited to functionality. Shame how hard Apple locks down their devices.


Let’s just make a 42 inch at this point? Doesn’t anyone else just want to carry around a tv sized computer around with them all day?


Far too big


They are catching up to the galaxy tab s8 ultra


MacBooks are practically iPad sized already…

Always amazed laptop users want such a small screen (especially for professional work), so this will probably appeal to apple people.


[deleted]


Good for them, I guess?


Who cares


[deleted]


They will run an ad campaign showing how it's infinitely faster than a PC that is turned off. [As is tradition](https://www.macworld.com/article/627222/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-m1-ultra-benchmarks.html).


Should I eat the vanilla paste or the cuttlefish and asparagus?


Oooh a new iPad! Feels like 2012 all over again.


I have a 12.9. It is too big for my needs. But I understand needing it if you are using it for your job and you need the size. I wish I would have bought a smaller one.


How is this news… M2 will in everything M1


I have the 12.9” iPad Pro and at no point have I thought “this massive thing is too small”


Foldable iPad would be neat


This news is all bullshit


Still won’t run MacOS, so who GAF?


You have to buy an adapter to use the screen though.


Who gives a shit


wait, so they’re gonna make another iPad??? y’all 2011 is gonna rock! i can’t wait to see what the next decade holds!


That's always been my dream to get a bigger ipad pro but I just got the 12.9 m1 last year....damn


So i made a huge mistake buying the 14.6 inch Samsung after all…


Man am I glad I bought the micro center warranty for my ipad.   Be a shame if I broke my 12.9 incher pro right when the new one launches.  

Hacks


Yawn, why bother.. ipad should be a commodity product by now


Why even have iOS on these? They are powerful enough to run OSX easily.
M1 is witchcraft enough, M2 is just crazy power for something as simple as iOS.


I think anyone and everyone assumed this about half a second after they announced the M2. No one would say “oh I guess they’ll go back to the upscaled iPhone processors after m1”.


Google getting its hat ready on a platter for its 2023 release.


Does that mean the autocorrect for text will actually work? iOS is so not ready to be a pc replacement. And if you find it to be ‘good enough’ you’re not going to need M2 power.


It better boot into Mac OS or this is just more extra large e-waste.


It's just a MacBook that's completely locked to the app store at this rate.


Call it what iMad


Ok? And?


Then they'll make a 14.2" iPad pro with an M3 chip, then M4,5,6,7,8,9 etc. This will never end. Do we really need "sources" to tell us this?


Apple: \*Designs a convenient handheld device that can easily replace a notebook computer\*

Apple Product Development: \*Makes it more than a foot in size\*

Me: 'WTF....?'


Just curious: For anyone who owns an iPad (and not for work) Do you use it?


Literally my Macbook Pro with a better chip and touchscreen.


I have a 12 inch ipad pro and that is way too big.  I wish I bought the smaller one. 14 inches would be an unwieldily monster of a unit.


This model is gonna hurt when I drop it on my face while laying in bed


just bring the pro apps already apple. what the point of so much compute power if you can use final cut pro, logic or the whole adobe suite


What the fuck do you use a 14 inch tablet for that wouldn't be more convenient as a convertible laptop.


I have a problem holding in my hand, for more than 30 minutes, a 10.5" tablet.  
A 14" one? That's just a laptop with no keyboard.


Kinda pointless, no? Big and heavy as hell.


I have two iPad Pro: a Gen 1 and Gen 2. Both take terrible video, especially when you upload the video to social media. What gives?


Make the ipad more useful with Pro apps please. Was hoping for something at WWDC but was left wondering why I had an M1 iPad.


iPad is so close to the perfect computing device if it wasn’t for Apple locking it to the App Store.


And it will suck just as badly as the current generation MacBook “Pro”


If Adobe can get its shit together and give us full versions of the CC suite to run on it, I'd be all over it. Let's hope we get there soon.


Lol “developing”


While I can't imagine what a 14.1 iPad Pro, M2, maxed out ram and hd would cost........I do know I want one.


So for the hipster fan boys the just announced IPads will  soon be ancient relics like the 2020  IPads that Apple sees as unworthy of new features. Fortunately for them, they always seem to have endless money to grab whatever is new.


Did the 2 source got their source from the same source?


Sht ain nun


Just make a surface book with macOS and call it a day


Well it better damn well have USB capabilities. It’s the only fuckin thing holding the iPad back from being a proper hand-held computer.


Well shiyat, i just bought an M1 iPad Pro 11 a couple months ago


Loving my tab s8 ultra right now. Apple probably noticed it's success and was like "why don't we have one of those."


Day 1 for me. As an artist I wish my iPad was even bigger.


Direct influence from S8 tab Ultra?


I already regret my big pro pad, just get the iMac or MacAir if going that big.


Why? So i can run Garageband marginally quicker? I love the ipad M1 but i am desperate for something PRO about the ipad pro


iMat


I can forecast too, after this there will come an iPad with.. wait for it… an M3


Seems like a MacBook Air but just a screen. Can apple pick a size scheme for their products please, we now have 12-13-14-15-16 plus the iPad sizes that range between 8.9-11.


This is going to change everything!!!


What could you possibly be doing on an iPad that would justify this? Video rendering and that’s literally it


hey maybe apple could bring macos or at least xcode for gods sake to the ipad now


That is going to be so big!


Make it OLED already...


Maximum screen space, minimum functionality


ANSI Letter size (8.5x11in) would fit without reduction?


[deleted]


I wonder if they'll ever take the MS Surface approach and go actual MacBook pro touchscreen.


It would be nice if it could run MacOS


Or a touch screen iMac that can angle down to be drawn on with an Apple pencil???


No still just an iPad. I have the 12.9 M1 iPad and other than a beautiful display it can’t do anything that an iPad Mini can’t.


Without any worthwhile software to make use of the hardware


I bought the 2021 MBP with the M1 Pro. It will be my last MacBook. It’s an amazing machine, but if I’m going to stay in the Apple ecosystem, I want a tablet with the ability to run MacOS apps. I’m not a power user by any means, but I do use some apps only available for Mac and can’t leave them behind.


I wish. Being able to use an iPad as a fully functioning laptop is the only thing that prevented me from buying a pro over the air. I would have gladly bought the more expensive one if it were both a digital art tool and able to replace my laptop. 

Instead, despite the hardware being more than capable, they want to restrict the software.


Without the ability to be productive like a Macbook


I’ve been waiting for this. I’d gladly pay for it.


That will not be possible, its apple your talking about. If they made macbook touch then people will eventually shift to ipad and ipad sales will go down


Much faster


No it’s not. 99% of applications are totally locked and useless on an iPad.


I’ll buy it


I'd consider getting one if they actually make it that.


If they would just make a touchscreen macbook... but, different OS, no keyboard... they're flirting with it, but won't do it.


Make this with MacOS and give me 4 USB C ports and I’m sold. I’d love the portability of this


Ah yes. I also rip my Macbook screen off my keyboard when I need to use it in tablet mode. /s


I love scrolling the internet with a touch screen. 

Seriously, chilling in the recliner with my laptop is great. I would have bought the new m2 MacBook Air if it had it.


With no calculator app


I wish.


That you can’t code on.


Not true. Apps are not feature complete


And that's all we ever wanted since the beginning.

Bout time.


It's nothing like a MacBook.


Just?


yeah man gimme that 5ghz for my paint app

It's a different market. The touchscreen and pen alone make the iPad suitable for a completely different set of use cases. It's not uncommon to see people have both a MacBook and an iPad or a Mac and an iPad


As an illustrator the iPad Pro is perfect.


It's a different market. The touchscreen and pen alone make the iPad suitable for a completely different set of use cases. It's not uncommon to see people have both a MacBook and an iPad or a Mac and an iPad


Because I can’t use a laptop in my crane… I need an iPad Really. And one that handles my photography work with high res files


I feel like most of the comments in this thread didn't watch the WWDC iOS 16 introduction where Apple demonstrated an iPad update that allows it to use multiple apps simultaneously, resizably, and on multiple displays with a keyboard and mouse.  (Stage Manager)


Because Samsung released a 14" tab that out-appled Apple and they can't have that.


I agree! the 12.9 is a little cramped for sketching. I’ve often wished they would make one a little bigger but I’m not sure they ever will.


Yeah. Apple, just go ahead and just take my money. I don’t need food!


Amen! Nobody understands us, artists! 😖


Who needs this?


I’ve been windows/android my whole life but picked up an iPad Pro at the start of the pandemic. It has changed how I make art from bottom to top - 2d, 3d, vector - everything. As an artist this thing is bonkers. I haven’t touched my 24 Wacom in well over a year.


I agree, if I had to choose one device (excluding phone) to do 100% of business on, it would be my iPad Pro.

The versatility of the pencil, tablet, and magic keyboard setup can’t be beaten.

I have a lot of computing hardware so all of my devices have different purposes but it would be no question for me if I needed to eliminate down to one.


My only issue as an artist is that I used to use Manga Studio on my Cintiq companion and now apparently it’s called Clip Studio and you cannot outright buy it for iPad. You need a subscription. Been using Procreate to no trouble but I miss my inks that I used to do in Manga Studio. They were just so smooth.


I can’t picture them releasing Logic Pro for iOS. It would probably be for the worse in terms of a software evolution. Plus you’d need so much connectivity adapters and other crap.


This made me cackle.


Same lol


Doesn't make sense to even have the m1 in it. It's just way overpowered for any reasonable use case as long as they are going to stop iPad users from having full mac OS functionality. 

If I could use it as an all in one device I would upgrade to the 12.9 pro in a heartbeat.


does it run garage band?


I’m surprised to hear someone say this after using my iPad Pro as my primary computer in the IT field for almost 2 years. I absolutely adore it. Can’t say enough nice things. In my personal life I’m a nature photographer and I do a ton of editing photos and short video clips on it. Just an awesome machine. I feel really good about it’s ability to do basic computing.


Deeper grooves at a 7...


Ultra absorbency


iPads are very useful to students, tasks like note taking and researching/writing essays are very easy with ipad os. I understand it’s not a anywhere near a full computer but it definitely has its strong suits over other devices. I personally would love to see a bigger ipad with a less restrictive OS, even better that it will have the M2.


Art. Especially if you work more at home and only need to take it out once in a while.


My old iPad Pro has been one of the best tools I’ve ever owned as a digital artist, and increasing its performance means larger canvases, more layers, all that good stuff. Not really a great device for the average candy crush player due to the price, but it holds its own against other professional digital art equipment. 

Thats at least one perspective, I’m sure this is helpful for other creators and hobbyists.


to part soccer moms and grandmas from their money for facebook machines.


Exactly


So get a Mac then?


With 70% less functions


Apple: we’ve put the M10 Bionic Fusion chip in the iPad, still locked in an a mobile ecosystem though


I imagine because M1 will be phased out in favor of M2.  No reason to keep producing M1 chips if all of your devices will be moving to the next generation.


I feel like most of the comments in this thread didn't watch the WWDC iOS 16 introduction where Apple demonstrated an iPad update that allows it to use multiple apps simultaneously, resizably, and on multiple displays with a keyboard and mouse.  (Stage Manager)


Why do Chevy make the Corvette? It’s super expensive and too fast to take full advantage of the performance legally on roadways. Therefore many people don’t buy it, while also not complaining that it exists.


They're great for digital art, I have one specifically for that use. I'd love to buy a nicer pro and sell my laptop so I only have one device but that's not possible when the thing is tied to iPad apps only.


Then get the iPad Air.


Artists


It’s not like your device is going to be obsolete when this thing launches.


Wiggle, wiggle…


It’s MacOS now. And I would love to see it available on an M2 iPad Pro.


Yeah I don't get this. Why stop at 14"? Keep going to 21"


Sad how simpletons disagree with your comment. It's literally like buying a Ferrari and only allowed to use it for 40mph. " But why would you need to go faster than that!". We live in a world full of idiots who are ready to defend companies that shortchange them.


Super speedy touch screen for big files


Why do people always bring up price? If it's too much for you or you don't find value in it, move along. But plenty of people can easily spend 1500 on this if it suits their needs.


Seriously?!? It's 1/10


Not if it’s used as a laptop, it’s perfect. I mean they will have a smaller version.


Faster is always better.


The difference between the (was it the…) A13 Bionic and the M1 made a huge difference in rendering photos and video on Lightroom. It’s easy to assume the M2 will provide even more performance.

Tbh my MacBook Air cooks thru the processes faster than I can find stuff to use it for so


A lot of idiots ready to defend they're browsing device


 Yes — I’m using it to type this. I’ve had iPads for 11 years now, and (when indoors and not on my PC) am usually glued to it like most people are glued to their smartphones. I have my phone too, but it feels claustrophobic using a smaller screen when I’m not outdoors or physically mobile.     
Probably the only way I’d maybe stop using an iPad is if I bought another tablet, like a Surface Pro. But knowing me, I’d probably keep them both within arms reach while simultaneously watching TV.


I wish they'd allow JIT.  All I want is an iPad Pro that can run VMs and Dolphin.


This is scary asf if iPadOS becomes the future of computing. We need more open software, not more closed


And that has been Apple’s goal all along. Joke’s on them, though: the iPad will never replace a traditional computer without developers building feature-complete versions of apps for it. So far, that hasn’t happened en mass. That’s why Apple gave up on their plans to stop making computers and we’re seeing them reinvest in the Mac.


Bingo.


Not if they aren’t forced to. The iOS store is a closed ecosystem and Mac OS is not.


Slap on an iPad as the screen of a Macbook Pro body, have two discrete CPUs/GPUs and maximize your compute potential!


I think eventually, there is a huge push towards convergence.


No they won't. If they do it's admitting that MS had a better design


It most definitely can. But Apple won't have it.


iPadOS when used as a tablet.  Automatically switches to MacOS when you dock the keyboard case.


>without any worthwhile software 

I’m at a conference using an iPad Pro as my primary computer and it has a browser, email, and office365. For lots of professionals that’s all the software they need and an iPad is still smaller than a MacBook and has a simpler interface. I can completely believe that there is other professional software that would be more hardware intense but equally suitable to the simpler form factor, and/or that there’s utility to enabling more multitasking. 

I’m convinced some of the people who post this stuff on Reddit haven’t used an iPad since 2016. I was just meeting with an architect whose daily driver is an iPad Pro. He swears by using the pencil for design drafts and didn’t have any software complaints. We work with a designer that does most of her workflow in affinity photo on an iPad
Pro. Etc. This is a topic where there seems to be a massive disconnect between negative cyclical comments on Reddit and observable reality.

Like some of these comments griping that iOS doesn’t have access to the command line. I have to laugh at that, it’s so out of touch. The people buying this don’t need or even want the command line.


Not trying to be rude or anything, but I don’t think really understand what you’re saying.  As someone that’s designed multiple billboards, they are pretty low resolution.  They’re meant to be seen from far away after all.

The main advantage of iPads is for the Apple Pencil support.  To get an equivalent on a Mac, you’d need more equipment which will easily bring you to the price of an iPad Pro, except there’s honestly nothing as good as the Apple Pencil at this point.  Prefer it to any Wacom I’ve used.  Still an expensive tool though, though it depends on how it situated into someone’s workflow.  Still ultimately need a Mac for most work, but what the iPad does well it does significantly better.


Yeah that’s my point, why do these tablets need laptop level power? I’m sure there is a reason like it is cheaper for apple to build more M1s than open a new manufacturing line for a weaker iPad chip, it’s just kind of funny there is so much power in a device most people will use for YouTube, Facebook, and candy crush.


I bought a Surface Pro 8 because I wanted the best of both worlds -- a tablet I can draw on, which is also running the full Windows. Now that I've had it for about 8 months, I can confidently say I'm not super satisfied with the experience. The Surface Pro 8 works best as just a regular laptop with its keyboard cover connected, where you can occasionally do some touchscreen stuff, but trying to use windows fully in tablet mode is just not a great experience, no matter how much Microsoft claims it's optimized for touch. I find the experience of using my iPad much more enjoyable in 100% tablet mode than using my Surface Pro in 100% tablet mode by far, but obviously when I switch to laptop mode, the Surface Pro laps the iPad by a wide margin. I guess that's why I'm just not sold on the whole idea of Apple putting MacOS on an iPad, because they are obviously different operating systems, but my experience using Windows in tablet form, despite Microsoft's best efforts with their hardware, leads me to think it's not a good idea. iPad OS may be frustrating if you're looking for a laptop, but it works perfectly as a tablet, and I think trying to put MacOS on it would just not be as great as some people think it'll be. I don't doubt for a second that Apple has probably tried this in their labs and they probably reached the conclusion that, much like trying to use a Surface Pro completely as a tablet, there are just too many frustrating operating system things which are hard to get perfectly right for both mouse/keyboard AND touch screen at the same time.


Tablets do have their place. Way more portable than a laptop...


I will say I recently discovered I can use my IPad as a Remote Desktop and it’s a little game changing. I was on vacation and didn’t need to bring my whole computer I could just bring my iPad and hook up a mouse


Which is what sucks so much about the software and its limitations. As a photographer, I would LOVE to be able to use full-fledged Lightroom and Photoshop with the apple pencil on my iPad Air. The iPad versions are so dumbed down that I cant use them for any professional work, limited to pretty much tweaking some pictures while I'm on vacation until I get home to my computer.


iPads have very quickly become premier technology for digital artists. Many digital artists have completely switched from Cintiques to iPads.


Yea, apple want to keep people buying both devices. This isn't some convenience they are offering us lol.


I do wish it were just a little larger though. It feels a little cramped to me with all the tool bars encroaching on the canvas.


IMO that's not the issue. It's that what's the point in putting a full laptop-class CPU/SOC on a device with software that can't utilize it?

An 11in iPad pro that can run full MacOS would be like a modern day Netbook. Extremely light and portable, it'd be really cool.


Seeing how it functions, really feels like it's only a matter of time before Apple gives iPad Pro support for OSX apps (probably with some conditions as far as UI).  Stage Manager is effectively identical to a traditional Windows/OSX UX paradigm.  I'm really surprised Apple didn't announce iPad versions of Final Cut and Logic with this update.


I have the Tab S8Ultra and it's stupid fun use. It's honestly not a practical size for a tablet but every time I use it and have to cradle it in my arms to scroll through the news I just smile and think how dumb this is.


I read somewhere that they will


Graphic artists?


As someone also coming from Wacom, it's nice, but I find the latest Samsung Tab 8 Ultra to be more if not as functional (especially with Windows). Similar to the iPad's sidecar functionality, you can connect to Windows devices with (or without) Samsung's Second Screen app/functionality (you connect via casting). Which is cool since Windows recognizes the input as a native digitizer on a system-level (i.e. it's customizable and very responsive).

This is especially useful since the stylus uses Wacom's superior EMR technology (no charging necessary) — with a 2.8ms of latency (though I much prefer the MS Surface's carpenter-style pen shape). Apple Pencil is still at 9ms, so I'm still waiting to see it get a spec bump. The 14.6" sAMOLED screen real-estate is engrossing and I don't find the notch too distracting (the tiny bezels & thin body are worth it), unlike the 14" M1 MacBook Pro's more protruding notch.

The Android aspect of the device is still lacking in the designer apps department with only a limited selection like Luma Fusion, SketchBook, Clip Studio (but still no Procreate, Fresco, Affinity, etc.). Though it makes up for it with it's flexibility, better file and window management, and the Dex feature (desktop mode). Samsung has also done a better job on the productivity aspect of their big screened devices than Apple (lots of polished features), even with the onset of iPadOS 16's enhancements.

All said, this space is certainly more competitive than it was before. We now have two premium devices for designers to choose from (yay for options!).


Means nothing, but I have seen consistent reports for some time, from sources that I have a tendency to trust that it is definitely coming


It would be a miracle if apple made the thing actually useful.


must not do a lot of file organizing, the "file" system is atrocious


What do you do in IT field? It would be impossible to be a developer on an iPad, or even QA


Im suprised tbh, is this basic computing just cropping videos and posting them? Because i find it jaw droppingly useless for what i would define as basic computing. Handling pdfs, adding pages or splitting them, word processing, drag-dropping between apps, basic photo editing, anything in the office suite, hell even web browsing because of the total lack of good browser extensions and some pages insisting on loading in mobile.

I doubt taking notes requires an M2.


If you're doing research a nd writing essays on an ipad... Woof.  You'd be far better off with a solid Chromebook even or spend more (and less than a 14" iPad) and get a MacBook air m1


Yeah but you don’t need an M2 for that


Do they do one with a touch screen that I can comfortably read comics on?


Can't use a Mac for digital art. Can't use an iPad as a primary workstation. They want you to buy both. 

And for professionals with the budget to do so it might make sense as individually these devices excel at that but they are ignoring a huge market of middle class consumers who can not afford both devices.


And same or higher price….


Yeah I didn't even watch it in full, just summary, but I've learned my lesson with Apple over the years, and most people haven't and just like to rag on them. Years ago they had way more issues and complaints that Android solved, now it's the other way around in my opinion after using all types of products cheap and flagship. Apple just fucking works, it works well, and it pushes boundaries at a time that is right for society not 'bleeding edge' useless shit they end up dropping (but they have done that, sure)   


Stage Manager sounds pretty great, for people that need it


That's still no where near full functionality of a macbook


So you are telling me - the same m1 that was inside macbooks cant do multitasking on ipad pro thats why m2 was introduced - lmao. Makes no sense at all .


Except in your analogy, there's zero reason for the corvette not to go full speed except for Apple limiting the speed intentionally. Also, you can take the corvette full speed on specific locations.


You sure? It’s already not getting key pro/productivity features that $300 devices are getting.

What do you call that?


Yeah my bad, just an old habit..  apparently not many people agree with the idea of the MacOS being on a tablet, but windows works OK on a Surface


I really don’t get the hate from people. Cannot we all have our opinions? I just believe that iPad Pro users are sold these great amazing devices that the software is so limited on there’s little one can do with the iPad Pro with an M1 SoC. I know a lot of tech needs like myself were excited last year when the iPad Pro was announced with mini LED and M1, we were like they’re finally going to do something to make it work for multitasking and resizing windows and getting more out of the devices. But nothing happened. Even now, the latest iPad OS is so limited and most of the changes are only for M1 iPads. It just shows Apple doesn’t care about anything but selling more products. 

I love the Apple ecosystem. I am not happy that there are things so badly messed up. I use the newest MacBook Pro M1 Max in 16”, buy the newest iPhone annually, and run business servers off Mac minis. I have all the AirPod versions except the Max. They have the best SoC designs and are years ahead of everyone in hardware. The iPad Pro hardware is AMAZING. It’s the software that continues to ruin experiences based on expected value due to $2k+ iPad Pros not having simple multitasking. And now everything is so convoluted with the software there are few people who understand how to do something they want to do with software. The Apple devices are no longer intuitive. 

Tim Cook fired Scott Forstall because Scott was supposed to be the successor to Tim Cook after Tim got the company through the transition period. Tim got rid of all threats. Jonny Ive never threatened to take over leadership and didn’t like working at Apple and Tim begged him to stay as long as he could.


Because price is relevant to every purchase and investment you make? 

Apple overkills their iPads with those chips, ups the price to the price of MacBook Pro while offering much less usability than a MacBook. I had iPad Pro 12.9inch for $1300, MacBook Air for $900 and now largest MacBook Pro for $2200. And I can say loud and clear that iPad Pro’s are overkills that have same usability as the cheapest iPad Air, given the OS restrictions. 

You came to place where people have conversations and now arguing that no conversations should be held lol?


Was this not enough?

It is an alternative and won’t become the only option for a long time. iPad is amazing for people like me who don’t need anything more than the ability to take notes and then watch movies at home.


Pretty sure Apple never intended to replace a traditional computer. They wanted people to buy extra little computers.


> the iPad will never replace a traditional computer

I guess you've never walked into any college classrooms these days.  Last classroom I wandered into around 15% of the students were using *only* iPads in class.  They use the camera to snap photos of the board, take notes, write papers, etc.  I was blown away and asked a few if they preferred the iPad or their laptop and several said they liked the iPad better.  That's certainly not my choice, but they seem to make it work for themselves.


I would buy one of these in a heartbeat if it could run MacOS. If I’m limited to App Store and IOS? No way in sweet hell, my iPhone does the same exact things with a smaller screen.


Not forever.

Apple is already working hard to eliminate that with gatekeeper defaulting to disable downloaded apps and suchlike.


This sounds familiar… do you remember those parents from the last couple months? What if the display is the iPad and the keyboard activated MacOS mode similar to those Android phones that support a desktop mode when plugged into a display.

No one will care, they'll call apple revolutionary. 

Look at all the design stuff apple took from Samsung..the iphone 6 basically took from the galaxy S5, then 2 cameras, then 3 cameras, then the current bezel-less screen design.


What happens to what you were working on when you switch?


Even fine with it only switching to macOS when coupling it to an Apple(tm) approved overpriced screen.


The browser based applications I use for work on my Mac air (which I would love to replace with a powerful iPad) are un-useable in IOS.


I echo this, I have an iPad Pro that I have been using since mid 2019. I use it mostly for reference materials or advanced photo editing since it can handle larger files than my desktop.


Exactly. I’ve been using an iPad Pro for work for a few years now. Especially since Adobe ported Illustrator and  Photoshop to the iPad. Procreate and Affinity are top notch programs as well.


None of what you've mentioned needs the power of an M2 chip though.


It's funny that it is Microsoft software that has made the iPad an actual viable work solution!


So, if you don’t use the stylus, an iPhone can replace your iPad Pro. 

The iPhone has a browser. 

The iPhone has email. 

The iPhone has Office 365. 

. . .

This is my problem with the iPad “Pro”: it’s being pitched and designed as an Apple Wacom tablet with a browser and mobile apps. 

Want to use actual professional apps like Final Cut Pro or Xcode? Buy a MacBook, you’re not the right kind of “pro”.


Lmao I have an iPad Pro. It just doesn’t have worthwhile software that makes it “pro”. For it to be pro it needs to have actual multitasking. Both Split View and Stage Manager are half-assed solutions to this that just make things more annoying. If apple provided a **true** freeform window mode, it would be much better. This is more of an OS issue than it is a third party software issue.


More procreate layers!


You pretty much explained it.  For higher end iPads it’s better to just borrow their entry level laptop chip than making their X or Z version of the mobile chips.  And of course the lower end iPads are just using the cell phone chips.  On the super entry level they can use leftover stock of last gen mobile chips and then current gen mobile for the mid priced.

It’s smart on their part and it still allows them to claim having the most powerful tablet by a mile.

And even though it’s not indicative of the average consumer, the extra power is helpful for land surveyors that use engineering software.  They are up in remote areas taking pictures and modeling and it’s nice to have a portable device that can take the pictures and import directly into their software.


I personally use my iPad Pro for art and digital design and find the extra power quite helpful. Most of the work I do is quite large and requires a capable machine. I could do it on a computer, but I find the iPad Pro to be my go to for mobility and I appreciate and utilize the power. I can design on the go, right in front of clients. I love it. I may be one of the few, however.


People don’t buy $1200 iPad pros for playing YouTube videos and going on Facebook. They’re mostly used by professionals in art media, like graphic design and music production. These are not the tablets from last decade that you hand over to your toddler to occupy them while you get drunk with your friends. Do you not understand how much you can do with a 14 inch Apple touchscreen these days? You can run an entire company off those things.


[deleted]


Because they can’t provide you a product for 100 dollars when you’re happily paying 800 just because you only need an internet machine that 34 dollars worth of hardware can solve.


I want to see what Capture 1 for iPadOS is like, especially if it's got any kind of tethering capabilities, as I think it would be a game changer for night shoots doing astro or other long exposure work.

I would love to see Lightroom Classic ported to iPad some day, that said, I don't know how much of the full functionality would be crippled due to iPad limitations (which might not be an issue with M1 ones anyway). Or at the very least, a Lightroom Classic Lite.

If I could, for instance, offload from memory card to an external SSD, via LrC, so I can just get home and plug my drive in, and transfer the catalog over, it'd be great. Or even just do straight up copy from media to SSD for backups on the go, I'd be a very happy camper.

&#x200B;

Other things I'd like to see, the ability to quickly cull or classify images based on touch gestures so I can get home, transfer the catalog and start working on them right away


I thought Lr on iPad had most of features of Lr on computers. It seemed almost identical when I used it before. PS is another story though… affinity photo is a really solid alternative to PS for the iPad that’s been out for years.

Edit: made sentence make sense


try affinity


Really for procreate? I’ve never had that problem but it may be my workflow is different than yours. I’d gladly take a bigger screen just for more options though.


MacOS's UI would work terribly with a touch screen.
I would kill for an iPad that could run MacOS or at least MacOS apps in a VM when a keyboard/mouse is present though.

Take it with you, it's an iPad.  Plug it in to an external display, bam, Mac.


Yeah, I'm really hoping for it.  The ability to run Mac apps when hooked to a keyboard/mouse or external display or something.


They basically said this is coming. They called it „desktop class“ if I remember correctly. It still has to be optimized for touch (which makes sense).


[deleted]


As a graphics tablet it’s insanely useful. If you don’t work on that stuff it’s kinda lame yeah.


I manage local and cloud documents and files through the Files app. I could certainly make improvements to it but that could be said for the Finder as well. It's a pretty traditional file system with a mediocre UI, IMO.


We are an MSP and network security company for SOHO to medium sized businesses. Most of my work is deploying things like endpoints through management software, servers through web portals and client ticketing systems through the web. We’re pretty much all automated. The iPad acts a terminal in cases where I need hands on a desktop but that’s usually a specific client request. In those cases I can remote to an on-prem workstation.

I mean...with external display support and better window control you can absolutely make use of the M2 in an efficient manner for editors, artists, and creators. My honest guess is that Apple has plans to either port over more Mac software or to open up part of the Mac library for iPad.

MacBook still out classes the iPad in terms of battery life, memory, io, and storage so I don't think bringing Mac software functionality to the iPad would dip into their laptop sales in a considerable manner, casual users are probably already buying the iPad air over the MacBook anyway.


Photoshop and capture one do. Absolutely. This is geared towards people with high resolution media


It’s not about power. The M2 is much more efficient than its competitors.


Why not? Photo and video editing can use lots of horsepower.


Most M2 sold will be used to power a browser viewing Facebook/Netflix/email....


They don't know that and it's not in the salesmen's interests to disclose it, actually the opposite.


The answer is no.


You can totally afford a older model of both and use the iPad as a drawing tablet with the Mac via Sidecar:

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210380


Exactly!


Ya, I think you've got it right. I do wish apple would take some bigger swings though. It feels like right now they're playing catch-up with features implemented on other devices, but with safer, more polished, albeit truncated versions.

iPad is my everyday device, I'm hyped for stage manager, but I was hoping it would be more freeform like what Samsung has got going on right now.


No, the update is for the current M1 iPads.


No. Nobody is telling you that. By all means keep using the M1 iPad for years to come.


So you bought a device for features it didn’t have? I assume they are not removing features from previous models?


The support is there in the software and hardware, but Apple won’t approve anything that uses JIT / virtualization / emulation in the App Store.  Hence why there’s no Parallels or game emulators or UTM.


Does this still work? Asking for an idiot (me)


Probably made worse by the emergence of laptops that cost less and do more (lmao Apple's slogan).

I mean you can buy a MacBook Air with 8gb RAM and 256gb SSD for $1,000. Meanwhile a 12in iPad Pro with 256gd SSD and Keyboard is $1,550. 

50% price increase for not much. Ain't worth it.


Eh. They have done pretty great adoption in certain niche industries.

I do product design and illustration, and actually prefer Android when it comes to phones. But you can pry my iPad pro and pencil out of my cold, dead hands. It is quite simply the best art & design tool I've ever used, and I've tried most options in the space already. Desktop apps just don't have the right interface design to be as efficient and frictionless, even if they do have touch screens and pencils and such.


Its a great replacement for notes. Handwriting is so undervalued as a learning tool. Typing can’t replace it for memorization.


We’re these numbers festering before the pandemic? Because a lot of field reps used ipads, and a lot of them stopped when everyone went WFH.

Tablets can be extremely useful for business, but only in specific circumstances. In general a laptop/desktop is preferred.


Except for companies that do their work exclusively in webapps


People figured out that they're not actually very useful for anything but wasting time in an inefficient manner. *Almost* anything done on an iPad could be done more efficiently on a laptop, desktop, phone or DSLR camera.


iPad is my primary computer for everything except software development or scientific studies :3


But…that girl everyone was mad at for not knowing what a computer was all those years.


Until they get to their junior year of college and suddenly they need a real computer to do the rest of their courses because none of the software they need is on iPads. As a current grad student I see that one too many times.


In the classroom it is not likely you need the full power of a laptop or the use of all the free programs. 

That way you can have a desktop machine at home and the ipad for travel.


I didn’t say iPads are not ubiquitous. I said the software isn’t there… yet. Until then, iPads won’t fully compete. Also, I’m a college professor, so I’ve seen plenty of tablets and laptops in class. Word for iOS, Pages, and Google docs can’t compete with the full PC version of Office. On mobile and online versions, I have to teach my students workarounds for basic formatting techniques like hanging indents and creating styles because the standard options aren’t there. It’s ridiculous. Apple can talk all they want about how an iPad is a replacement for a PC… and it is in many general scenarios. But not all, and certainly not even in some elementary ones.


Yup. I did this my entire junior and senior years of undergrad back in 2010-2011. Feels like forever ago.

At the time, I was the only person I saw with just an iPad. I loaded all of my reading materials into a PDF reader app that allowed highlighting and bookmarking. Every textbook that wasn’t PDF had an e-reader version available that I also loaded. 

They didn’t make keyboards for them at the time. I just typed away on the touchscreen, and it was just as fast as the laptop (for me).

I was a German major too. So being able to click a word and see translation or hear pronunciation was huge.

I’d encourage every student who can get away with it to ditch the laptop. Especially now.


... And this replaces traditional computers how? I guess you never walked into anything more "tech-y" than a college? You cited one specific example where even laptops are not that favorable. It's a lot of bulk for something usually done with a piece of paper, and you don't need the power of a traditional computer to take notes.

Your phone takes notes, and isn't a traditional computer. Things can be more than one purpose. But just because it can be purposed for many things it doesn't mean it's supposed to be a master of all tasks. The iPad most certainly can't replace the full processing power of a traditional computer. That's not arguable from a technical perspective.


I know but we'll know ;)


GONE


Have you actually tried them on an iPad? I bet they work just fine. Several years ago Apple changed Safari on iPadOS to straight up be the desktop version, and it self-reports itself as the Mac version and is fed the full-fat desktop version of all websites.


That’s a bummer, but it sounds like that’s a problem caused by the developers of those web applications more than any flaw in iOS unless there is some technical reason they just cannot support iOS Safari. Supporting safari can be a real pain though, it has its own quirks vs chrome. But on the other hand it’s probably good for the industry that there’s at least one other mainstream browser rendering engine.


To quote what I mentioned 

> I can completely believe that there is other professional software that would be more hardware intense but equally suitable to the simpler form factor, and/or that there’s utility to enabling more multitasking. 

I'm sure an architect will be able to make use of that processing power, there's likely apps like Revit not yet on iOS that will be ported if the hardware can support them. There weren't many apps that could make good use of a precision stylus till the pencil released.


Lol, I think even Apple has given up on winning that war at this point. Office365 users still buy their hardware. Except Keynote, really specifically, still seems to be very popular at some shops. Like I don't even know what Apple's word competitor is called but I know multiple people who only use keynote for presentation decks.


That speaks far more to the dominance of MS Office than it does about any specific hardware or software limitations of Apple. Pages / Sheets / Keynote are completely adequate pieces of software and for someone who uses a Mac casually at home they work fine for the handful of documents I need to make a year.

Office is what everyone uses at work, at every job I've ever been to, it's what we learned to use in school, it's what literally the whole world uses, and it has over 2 decades of ironing out the kinks.


I feel like it’s completely obvious there is much more utility to using those applications on a bigger screen with more horsepower and not draining the battery on my smartphone to a document editor. Like of course an iPhone can’t replace it, editing a PowerPoint deck on an iPhone would be absolute hell and would probably pull 20% off my battery. I assume this is a serious comment but it comes across like some kind of smarmy remark because I honestly cannot imagine how you could think connecting a keyboard to an iPhone and editing a word doc on it would be an equal replacement. 

I’ve said in replies to other people, it depends what your “pro” application is. Your philosophical objections to how you feel the iPad is being marketed aside, the real life people I know who use the stylus for drawing applications at work find it an effective tool and would definitely not be dragging a Wacom Cintiq connected to a MacBook to their meetings instead to do design drafts. They’d be doing them on paper and digitizing them afterwards, the slower inferior process the iPad Pro has replaced for them. 

It’s back to what I said about the terminal, the people buying these devices to use professionally do not need or want to run Xcode on it. There are a host of other professional use cases for a computer beyond whichever ones the tablet form factor is worst suited to. I don’t really understand your “problem” honestly, for the people who need Xcode and final cut there is the MacBook Pro and for people who need different professional applications there is the iPad Pro. Like in my example above, a MacBook+Wacom is not a useful or economical replacement for the use cases my colleague swears by his tablet for.


I do not have those problems, and I at least haven’t heard the complaints from the other people I mentioned, so I think it depends on what your particular “pro” application of the device is. 

I would guess they’re going to continue improving multitasking since that’s been a focus of recent iOS updates and seems like an obvious application for the improved chips referenced in the OP article.


I’m with you on that. My iPad is for work. I’m a tattooer. I draw nonstop on my iPad. A bigger more powerful iPad would be great for me. I’m into it.


I do this! My 2018 12.9 iPad Pro gets most of the work done and the pencil makes it a breeze. I use cloud documents to switch to my MacBook pro to use features the iPad lacks. Went for dinner with a client last night and used the iPad to show them artwork, found it very useful having a large screen too.

Edit to add, still a very capable machine 4-5 years later!


> People don’t buy $1200 iPad pros for playing YouTube videos and going on Facebook. They’re mostly used by professionals in art media, like graphic design and music production. 

Tbf I use mine to watch videos and youtube and reddit... I'm sure most people do too.


Music production on the iPad ain't there yet. Nothing has real feature or ease of use parity for DAWs. They can be neat controllers, but I don't think anyone is making them central to their careers.

They are amazing for reading sheet music tho


Running an entire company off those? Maybe only if youre running a lemonade stand for your kids or maybe if you remote into an actual computer. This thing is still running phone applications.


Except people do.

To me ipad is just another gimmick toy, and like all other gimmick toys, some people can do cool stuff with it

if you are serious about business then buy a macbook, or if you want tablet form, surface.


I'm honestly still, after years of having one my company issued me, trying to figure out what exactly an iPad is good for. Not that it doesn't do things well, just that it never seems like the ideal way to do anything. 

I prefer browsing forums and reading on my phone, if I have to do any significant work, it's on my laptop. 

The only time I use my iPad is to watch movies on planes. And only then because it's easier to fly with than my laptop. 

In theory they gave them to us to read drawings (I'm in industrial construction). But I can do that pretty well on my phone, and it fits in my pocket.


Omg YES. I’m a full time photographer and videographer and Tethering capability on iPad is by far my Top 2 requests. With the second requirement of batch editing to copy adjustments from 1 image from a session and paste same adjustments to 1 or more images from the same session.

I exclusively use Capture One Pro 22 & Photoshop for my workflow. And ALWAYS tether whenever shooting in studio. 

If the iPad could seamlessly tether capture images and copy & paste adjustments I could sell my MBP and do all my professional work on the iPad.


Tbf the arm macos is probably very similar to ipados anyway, it's just a different UI. They could run macos on an ipad but with the ipados UI instead, there's no reason why that wouldn'tbe possible...


I'm one of the few people who actually really uses the touchscreen on their windows laptop.

I would pay silly money for this.

Here you go!


Yeah reason I bought one was to draw and it's the best. But they're deliberately robbing people of full functionality


You cant even compare the purposefully crippled files system on an ipad to finder lol I cant even take you serious now.


I thought you said you were in IT? My companies junior case workers manage local and cloud documents too and they certainly aren't in IT. I guess if your IT job is clicking buttons and dragging icons around you could use an iPad.

Edit: Lol reddit is full of dumbasses.


Is there a reason why iPad would be more usable than say, MacBook Air? (Or heck even something like 13inch dell XPS if OS doesn’t matter for you?)

Reason being that iPads are over killed with specs, yet are cut in their usability and overpriced (12.9 iPad Pro costs more than MacBook Air, and the latter is more versatile)


Yeah yeah of course, i guess im comparing it to macos because it had everything i needed to do those built in. "Preview" is a pretty powerful app which i missed a lot on ipad.


Maybe if you told us what "In IT" actually means we would have some understanding. What is it you actually do with the iPad? It honestly doesn't sound like you really have an IT job.

Edit: Lol reddit is full of dumbasses.


Professionals use iPad for photoshop?


Exactly


You’re missing the point entirely. Apple doesn’t want to, and will never, sell you an all-in-one device, regardless of how much bullshit you fanboys can shovel


Keep in mind that only M1 iPads will support stage manager.


That’s so weird, but good to know!


Can’t it just be sideloaded? I often used that method to get emulators on my non-jailbroken iPhone back in the day. Or is this more of an “it’s not allowed, so why bother developing software for it” kinda deals?


There is a reason Apple purposely keep touchscreens off of their laptops.


I think only tablets ppl should go for are the air for most and 11inch anything higher than the 11 inch is a waste of money


Yeah there are some niches where they are still popular and useful. 10 years ago everybody wanted them no matter their use case though.


What apps do you use for product design on the iPad?


This is so true.  But the apps themselves are still pretty limited in some ways.  I still *need* a Mac in my workflow.  Ideally they would just bring Apple Pencil support to Macs.


I have notability open on my desk in front of me all day every day at work. It’s a giant mess of to-do lists, diagrams, doodles, I couldn’t work without it. 

Also love it for reading and marking up reports.


To be fair, actual notepads are so cheap and better


[deleted]


That is basically my plan too. I don’t however think it replaces traditional laptops for most people.


Damn, what a throwback haha. I still remember how pretentiousness she sounds to this day.


That very much depends on what your exact major is.  Even though I do need a computer, it’s only like 5% of the total time.  iPad is easily sufficient for 90% or more of my needs.  Those rare instances where it isn’t, I just go to the library which I use often anyways.


I’m not sure what you mean.  I’ve used an iPad to write all my college papers.  Pages *does* have styles as well as all formatting options necessary to meet both MLA and Chicago styles’ standards.  Never had an issue personally.


Huh, maybe I have something more to look into with this.


Hardware that no one makes software for is useless.


It was a mix of snarky and serious. 

Any time I’ve seen someone ask if an iPad Pro can replace their laptop, the honest answer tends to be: only if a Chromebook can replace your laptop. 

I have an 11” M1 iPad Pro and I love it. I use it daily, but iPadOS holds it back from being a serious option over a macOS/Windows laptop due to the lack of professional (non-web-based) apps.


People forget a lot of these type of products are for niche professionals


Bruh. People wouldn’t understand unless they’ve done it. I’ve pushed mine to the absolute max lol


yup, I love it as an extra tool... I actually used the ipad to paint some objects on the peacemaker show! (nomad sculpt is incredible)

honestly a 14" ipad would basically function as the best version of a cintiq... but would be pretty cumbersome on its own (I bought the 11" for portability)


And you purchasing it to watch YouTube helps keep the price low enough for the average amateur or professional to reasonably justify spending $1,200 on it. 

Anyone truly involved in professional computing knows that professional equipment can often be 2 or 3x that amount minimally, just look at the Mac Pro. Creating hardware professionals can use and selling it to everyone makes them more money, and keeps customers that need it for work happy.


Plenty of powerful iOS apps 

I swear people just come on this sub Reddit and type whatever is convenient for their point.


>to me

key words here lmao


I work from home and my tablet is my streaming media champ (Galaxy tab s7+). It's easier to carry around the house than laptop, has a fantastic display, and has solid battery life. 

I could probably do everything from my laptop but it's so much easier to use a touch optimized OS to get to media quickly. It is built for it!

Phones are too small for viewing on a kitchen table when making dinner and plus maybe I want to use my phone to text people while I'm watching something on the tablet.


Well for $300 it’s doubtful you’ll find a laptop that runs as smooth or lasts as long as an iPad, it’s a solid middle ground. My dads a tattoo artist and uses his to draw them up, I bought mine pretty much solely for game streaming from my computer


I’d imagine they’re nice to have if you want to do tasks like browse the internet while doing work on your main computer or just watching Netflix. Personally the main reason I considered getting an iPad was just so I could use it as a portable, wire free second monitor for my Mac, but the m1 air/pro is definitely overkill for that. 
My girlfriends mom has an iPad Pro with a magic keyboard which she uses as her “primary computer” and loves since she mostly just web browses, reads emails etc… so that is likely the target and the m1 helps by giving it enough overhead for HD gaming and video editing. 
I could also see people using an iPad as a “laptop” if you have a non portable workstation for your primary job. I still think to a good portion of people they are just big screen email machines/toys


I use my iPad all the time.  Having a larger screen than a phone is great for website use, I use it to stream Apple Music via AirPlay to my stereo system while browsing Reddit or playing little games, it's nice for laying back in bed and checking on stuff, etc.


I'm in your boat.  I have a desktop, a small (13") laptop, and a smartphone.  There's not really anything I need to do that falls in between the laptop and phone form factors.  A tablet does about as much as a phone but it doesn't fit in your pocket.  

I actually have an iPad I bought a couple years ago for a one-off project that ended up not happening, and it's just sat collecting dust.  I did use it for piano sheet music at one point, but then I decided to just print those out and that's simpler anyway.


[deleted]


Same!! I don’t use the touch screen, but I mostly use my laptop docked at home.

I’d kill for an iPad that can run Mac apps when docked. When I’m mobile I don’t need access to the heavy apps.


If only they made one a little bigger than the 12.9”. Doubt I’ll ever see that though.


I'm not trying to get you to take me seriously. I'm trying to provide experiential evidence in such a way as other people who share my technology needs would gain something from my advice. You're not my intended audience. You do provide a good counterpoint though. I'm sure people reading this will measure what you say with your tone just like I do.


Are you under the impression that they just described their entire job to you?


Well, I would happily answer the question if asked in good faith by someone genuinely curious about the ins and outs of my experience with the iPad because they themselves are attempting to qualify the purchase for themselves. That’s not my read of you though. My read of you is that you don’t care for iPads and for some reason take issue with the fact that they work well for me. So, you can pound sand.


Yep, loads of people use it.


Some do, at least for part of their workflow.  And not everyone who uses photoshop or similar apps are professionals.  In fact, most aren't.


No, I don’t think. I think they will converge the ecosystems. It’s just happen in the other direction, with Max running iPad apps.


Money and control and lack of incentive. If they open access for VMs that’s an entire revenue stream list of whatever people are circumventing the App Store to use in VMs. (Money/control) and Even if there was a way to track every applicable purchase made within a VM, why would they? They can already make people go through the App Store. (Incentive)


I think it’s a security thing. But also annoying.


You can use the profile method to sideload on any none Jailbroken device


AFAIK (I don't follow Apple stuff, so I may be misunderstanding it), sideloading on iOS (functionally) requires a developer account (costs ~100$/yr), and you need to reinstall/reactivate the app every 7 days.


You can get away with using a regular account, but there's a hard limit of 3 sideloaded apps at a time.


> There is a reason Apple purposely keep touchscreens off of their laptops.

I have personally never had any need to touch any screen that I haven’t been holding all by itself with at least one hand.

As in, holding the screen and only the screen.

Touch on a laptop screen is like a screen door for a submarine hatch. It’s a solution desperately hunting for a problem that doesn’t exist.


Yea to sell you an iPad for more money.


Unless you’re an artist. Right now the pro is perfect for me


So my primary ones are Concepts and POP, which I use for sketching interfaces and quick "paper" prototyping. Also the Jamboard app from Google, which makes zoom whiteboarding *almost* a replacement for regular whiteboarding.

I use Notability for taking notes in interviews and meetings, it's basically become my new Bullet journal. It's not quite as nice as real paper, but being able to convert the handwriting into digital text and send it out over Slack is great.

I also use Procreate for illustration, which has *completely* replaced Photoshop as my digital art tool of choice. There's really nothing I've tried to compare with it (though I hear the new Clip Studio Pro update makes it a possible competitor, plan to try it out on my next piece!)


Better for who? Not for minimalists. Not for the trees.


Makes sense. I also know that (at least for sales teams) Microsoft has done a good job or marketing their touchscreen laptops as an “alternative.” And providing a laptop and an iPad is more cumbersome.


There’s nothing to be unsure about. Beyond your anecdotal experience, obviously, other people (like myself) have found, and continue to be stymied by, multiple instances where iOS apps don’t cut it, even for tasks as basic as college essay writing. There are many situations (like those hanging indents, which Pages can do with some coaxing, or building a 100-page dissertation with an automated index and glossary, which neither Word nor Pages for iOS can do) where the app versions for iOS simply don’t have the features of their PC counterparts. So, the issue I addressed definitely exists, though it may not have been an issue you personally experienced. 

As I said, the iPad and its apps are fine for plenty of things, but there are many real-world (particularly professional) situations where the apps absolutely do not measure up. For those who require all the options of a full Mac or PC app (and, admittedly, that number is shrinking as iOS apps continue to improve), the iPad isn’t going to be replacing a traditional computer.


That’s true but iOS is probably the most popular software platform on the planet right now as far as new development.


The thing is that a Chromebook quite literally *could* replace Mac/Windows laptops for the vast majority of people.


Synthesizers are awesome on ipad


Yes


Yeah, it makes the price competitive.


Tbf I bought it to write notes on it. Still prefer paper, but the speaker quality totally blew me away, it's amazing. Also, the ipad 2 I bought a bit over a decade ago was ~800€ and still works fine, and the ~900€ I gave for the 2018 ipad pro actually seems cheaper considering inflation (it'd be around 1000€ today).

The ipad 2 wasn't a "pro" device by any means.


Imo ipads are cheaper today, than they ever were. Even the base model is great.


When will people understand that not every single thing is made for their use. They act like they’re the main characters of life. (Directed at the person you replied to)


I can see it being a great tool for digital art, so that makes sense.


I mean, personally I just use a second monitor as a second monitor.


For me, my tablet is just a bit too clunky for casual reading and browsing. It's much easier to lie in bed and read stuff on my phone.


You’re in luck!


*loads*


What's the point of mac's running ipad apps designed for touch screen if the laptops don't have that capability?


Let developers decide what is and isn't a security issue and hide the setting behind a "developer mode" or something.


?


You do not need a paid account to side load.  You can use a free dev account.   It was changed in 2015 with the release of Xcode 7.  There is a limit of 3 like you say but, there are ways around this by messing with the bundle ID of the app you are building.


Eek. Of course they’d lock it down further wherever they can.


I have a touchscreen Chromebook. I use the touchscreen occasionally when there is a large button to press and I don't want to deal with the touchpad. I sometimes find it marginally more convenient. I never use it for actual work, though.


I use the touch screen of my surface laptop all the time but mainly via the pen. I'd actually look a lot more seriously into going back to Mac OS if they had pen support and a touch screen and basically just made an Apple Surface.


Nah dude, when you're that close to the screen there's plenty of times it makes sense than using the trackpad.


I had a touchscreen laptop for two years when Hp first came out with them- I don’t think I touched that screen aside from cleaning it after the first month or two. 

Complete gimmick when you can access the track pad, swipe, and click faster than reaching up and tapping.


When touch screen laptops first came out, people complained because using one at a desk meant your arm was extended at length for hours a day, poking the screen. It’s a truly awful idea.


Reading comic books on it is AMAZING


I edit all the videos I make for work and clients on an iPad Pro, 12.9in and it’s amazing, (I literally only have the editing app, LumaFusion, and emails on it) and it’s worth every Penny. Editing with my finger/pen is so fast and efficient, I could never go back. A 14 in version would be awesome and come near the time I’ll need to update my 2018 model


iPad lives and dies by Apple pencil


[deleted]


Better for the people using it to write notes


Tablets aren't even an option anymore in the last 2 jobs I've had. You have to have special justification if you want one.


??? In what world would you use Word or Pages over LaTeX for serious academic writing?


It’s a mixed bag. I’ve been using the ipad+magic keyboard for my MA, and the majority of it is *fantastic* for studying: The split view is fantastic for having a doc open for the assignment writing while effortlessly flicking through pages of notes, epub textbooks, photos of blackboards, on Zoom etc. simultaneously that on my windows PC would take a lot of tabbing/tiny windows/opening several programs. The battery life means I can camp the library or study outside all day + commute while being lightweight for it. Absolutely I swapped from my laptop to the ipad for studying (as well as art) and I don’t regret that at all.

But I did run into some issues, esp. with PPTs losing its animations on both sides when I had to work with a windows user (neither of our PPT would play on the other) and formatting struggles once I was hitting the 50 pages of notes juncture that had me swapping to a pc to wrap up. I feel like the study flow it offers is leagues above laptops, but for the final product polish you’re often going to need a computer.


You click with the mouse instead of tip tap with your fingers.


walled garden


You can load stuff with a developer account I think ($100 a year but there are shared access account)


You say this as if all developers have benign intent.


You can use a developer profile to load an app . They cost a yearly fee for your own but there are sites where you can download one that is being shared and load apps that they host. Then it’s just a game of whack-a-mole for Apple shutting down whatever developer profile is being used.


They locked it down further because surprise, surprise people abused it.


The problem is that your brain knows that the touchscreen is there.

Any study would show that the mere awareness of the existence of a touch screen on a laptop lowers the UI/UX efficiency. It adds unnecessary complexity to the laptop UI/UX equation - something on par with a human being surgically adding a bonus third arm and then having to determine for every interaction when using the third arm would be appropriate.

In this case Apple has done the right thing by not adding touchscreens to laptops.


>I'd actually look a lot more seriously into going back to Mac OS if they had pen support and a touch screen and basically just made an Apple Surface.

It’s called an iPad Pro. It’s shockingly functional.


> when you're that close to the screen there's plenty of times it makes sense than using the trackpad.

If you need to be _that_ close to the screen just to be functional, _you need prescription eyeglasses._


And it gets _so gummed up_ with fingerprints, but lacks a tablet’s or phone’s ability to be quickly cleaned by wiping it back and forth on your shirt.

I mean, I guess you could still do that, in a “fuck the hinge mechanism” kind of attitude.


Same here cant believe how much more productive I am as far as creating documentation around engineering


Yeah.. I’m waiting for the 50 inches tablet


You....again. Lmao. Bro they gonna have to make you a sheet music tablet device soon.


I have all my college notes at my fingertips. Viewable on any of my apple devices. Indexed and searchable.

I could not tell you where any of my notes are before that.


You’re agreeing with me. Though I hasten to add that my wife is working on her doctorate and her entire field essentially publishes with Word. So, there’s at least one serious academic field that uses such tools.


Exactly, and it's a crying shame because the hardware in that ipad would otherwise be so good for dev work


Epic games was right


Yeah but no one is going to make software that has to be loaded that way and can’t be sold.


You don't even need the paid developer account profile anymore.  Apple  lets you build on real devices now without a paid account.

You haven't needed a paid account since Xcode 7.


You can't seriously be saying that having a touchscreen is any anyway comparable to something that having a 3rd arm sewn on and being told to have at it?


I would say except for the the most elderly/computer illiterate, people would have marginal to no perceptible difference in decision making between using a touch and non-touch device after using it for under a day.


Even if it did, users that struggle can just...have it disabled.


Do what literally every other vendor does, and has done for years, and offer both touch and non-touch variations of these products.


I've repaired these sort of products for a major vendor for years, directly interacting with users, and I have never seen anyone struggling to decide whether they'll use the touchscreen or touchpad.


This is just Apple doing their usual shit, as multiple others have brought up.


Have you used a Windows Surface? It's a full computer running a desktop OS that happens to turn into a tablet. Much different than what Apple is doing now even with the newer updates to its OS.


Maybe you have never used a laptop before that's why you're so aggressive regarding touch screens but your arms have to reach the keyboard and the keyboard is attached to the monitor - the distance of my eyes doesn't matter...you can use a touchscreen comfortably if you can use your laptops keyboard.

😂


Yeah.  I got an iPad with an Apple Pencil as a gift and didn’t expect to like it.  But the tools it enables for note-taking are *much* more powerful than most people imagine.  I actively avoid note-taking on paper now.


I was gushing to everyone who would listen that the tech from my first round in college 2010 vs today 2021 (when I re started) was making it completely unfair.   


The iPad Pro 12.9 M1 with pencil has made school assignments insanely organized. As my first iPad I've been blown away. Pencil some notes, pick the iPad up to scan a document, sign the document with the pencil and send it. Log into my home computer with JumpDesktop if I need to. The list goes on but I couldn't believe how much it let me blend tasks.  


The fact that I can pick my "computer" up, snap a photo of something, and go back to work is great. Picking it up to go downstairs and needing more light since the screen is on, then swiping down for the flashlight was cool. My laptop couldn't do that. Using it as a big screen for flying my DJI drone. Nice. 

&#x200B;

Internet is $20 a month unlimited ATT (22gig priority) but it has never ever slowed. Don't need a phone bill anymore with google voice. 

If I could get some sweet games on here that I like then this device, I'd be so set.


LaTeX tools are readily available on iPadOS lol

(yeah, I know certain parts of academia live in Microsoftland, I just ignore it)


I downloaded the public beta to test drive Stage Manager on my 12.9” M1 iPad Pro.

So far I‘ve been a bit disappointed.

In my opinion, the user interface isn’t intuitive at all. When a single, scaled down app is onscreen, the UI looks too much like the old app switching UI: a scaled-down view of the app overlaying a blurred, darkened view of my background picture. I’m used to that visual cue indicating that I *can’t* interact with an app, not that I *can*. It’s confusing.

I don’t like how I can’t place windows anywhere, and it’s hard to tell where I *can* place them. I frequently move a window, only to have it snap back to where it was before. The placement options are severely limited, since you can’t have a window overhang the dock, or extend off the side of the screen. It makes a 12.9” display, which previously always felt generous, suddenly feel super cramped.

The bugginess (which, granted, it to be expected in a beta) makes it hard to get in a groove, since resizing apps tend to make them bug out or just crash. It’s beta, I get it, but it doesn’t feel that usable, and I’m having a hard time learning it.

It’s somewhat better on an external display, but you can’t drag windows from one display to another, and it’s not intuitive to me how to move windows back and forth between one display and another.

The colors on my external display also appears really washed out. Granted, it’s an old HD display, but it looks fine on my Mac. Could be the lack of display profiles?

I want to love Stage Manager, and I want it to be a success, because I want my iPad to be more of a computer. But in my opinion, it’s still got a long way to go.


Aren’t iPads more powerful than original Mac osX devices sold in the early 2000’s? Why cant they support the level multitasking we saw in that era?

It really doesn’t unfortunately


I tried stage manager and it only makes sense to me on larger displays where you can afford to give up the screen real estate.

Trying to push this multitasking system on to their smallest screens feels like the exact opposite approach they should be taking.


Stage manager is okay, but imo is ultimately held back by iPadOS’s lackluster trackpad and keyboard support. It _works_, but I find myself clicking way more than I would on an actual desktop OS which slows me down too much to be as productive as if I were on an actual desktop. That being said, it’s better than no changes at all and I am interested to see how Apple continues to invest in productivity for iPad.


People were upset it was only available on M1 iPads. Now the conversation has switched to: “Stage Manager is not even a well-designed feature.” So I suppose Apple’s plan has potentially backfired. They want people to upgrade to get this feature, but now people are discovering it’s not even worth the upgrade.


Personally I feel a lot of the iPad revenue is from suckers like me who buy them hoping to be able to replace their laptop with them and quickly realizing they can't. The draw of the new multitasking to me was to be able to replace a laptop with an iPad that can do 80% of the work I do, and I don't think this iteration gets us there either. Gurman is right. That being said, it's maybe 50% there and having cellular built in is a tolerable weekend getaway machine. 

Apple, please put a cellular modem in a laptop or enable some sort of Mac mode on the iPad Pro - that's the killer feature I'm waiting for. Yes, I know some PCs offer it, but I want 15 hours of battery on a cellular laptop. That's the holy grail. Enough of this half assed multitasking.


I’ve been holding off replacing my 1st gen iPad Pro for years waiting for proper multitasking. Guess I’ll be waiting another year.


I personally don’t care about what they make at this point, I learned to utilize the split screen (or whatever they call it) and it’s become quite comfortable for me


iPadOS Pro should be a variant of MacOs, not a variant of iOS.

The “smart” window manager is simply not working. You want a window to be top right, it automatically slides down. Resizing windows works half the time and even then it doesnt resize the way you want it to. Instead of being faster it honestly feels slower than without Stage Manager. Simply put, Stage Manager isn’t it


It’s ridiculous that we’re over a decade into the iPad’s life and it’s still fundamentally a big iPod Touch.

I agree that the MB and iPad Pro should be the exact same product right now. Run regular MacOS with touch screen. I think they’re really weary of all the bugs and complications with touch-screen usability on a full-fledged OS, but hey- I get it, they want to streamline their income.

The basic iPad should continue as an iPhone OS, because it’s great for watching movies, taking notes, reading sheet music, running simple apps. But the Macbook/iPad Pro should merge into a better hybrid product. I hate using trackpads in this day and age.

Reassuring to know considering my 2018 11 inch iPad Pro is already missing out on new features...


I think Apple wants iPad to fill a “simple computer” role. Basically transfer current mba user to this category, and leave the truly pros to use Mac. 

So I don’t think they will bring the full Mac experience to the iPad for this reason. Otherwise the iPad is just another Mac, so why exist?


[deleted]


Apple is purposely holding back the iPad. They don’t want it to be level with Macs.


It’s really meant for external displays and [ultra wide displays](https://i.imgur.com/IGypuuf.jpg) at this point.


Just got the samsung s8 ultra...does multitasking beautifully....everything else I have is apple lol...


Apple pretty much perfected multitasking and multi window managing in the late 80s/early 90s. This over-engineered monstrosity is there just for the sake of being different.

Stage manager I think holds its purpose of something where you want window support for different tasks like twitter, safari and say a sports event or score. For general work though mac will always be the best option


I have been wondering for a while about Apple's view towards windows. On Windows, the snapping feature encourages user to use as much screen as possible. On macOS Safari doesn't even take up the whole screen when you zoom it. Do most macOS users use so little screen space to the point that Apple is comfortable to develop a multitasking feature centered around wasting as much screen space as possible?


The biggest problem I see with Stage Manager is it conflates open app windows with open apps. You can have windows for an app on one stage that do not appear in the app switcher, which is totally confusing. Stage Manager breaks the whole model of what apps are "running" vs. apps that have windows open. That means I never can tell if I have a window open on a stage somewhere or not.


Is it only me or this thing is completely absurd? 
Apple should give the option to install macOS on iPad, rather than trying to develop a feature that nobody wants…


The problem, which has somehow taken customers 10 years to realize, is that iPads don't actually serve a useful purpose. Seriously everyone I know who has one has relegated it to watching Netflix in bed, ereading (rarely), or some vague utility thing. Artists and a select few types of professionals have legitimate workflows, but that group is so small that I have no idea how they sell at the rate that they do.


Gotta say, I disagree pretty whole-heartedly with this article. I have been really enjoying stage manager, and it actually convinced me not to get the new MacBook Air (I’ve been living without a personal Mac for a while now, considering my iPad is already better than my 2015 MacBook).

>	An iPad that lets users run as many windows on one screen as they want, like a Mac, would be terrific

Yea, that’d be nice if it worked well. Apple claims it doesn’t, and that they have to limit the number of running apps so that every app remains immediately responsive to touch no matter the circumstances. That’s an important goal in my opinion, though I can’t comment on how truthful their claim is that you can’t go beyond their limits without breaking that promise. I do think that they probably should let you have 8 to a group, at least in full screen mode - I find that the iPad screen itself isn’t very useful when plugged in and would rather put all 8 of my apps on the external monitor.

>	The ability to bounce into one main app that sits in the middle of the display isn’t compelling. The long existing ability to Command-Tab between multiple full-screen apps is far better. 

I actually kind of disagree, but I understand why many prefer the full screen. I like having a centered window with quick app switching just one tap away along the side. If you don’t, no issue, just don’t use it. Stage Manager isn’t really meant to be the exclusive UX of the iPad (I think that it is this, not a lack of confidence as the article suggests, that is why stage manager is off by default and easy to toggle), and it isn’t really something you will feel the benefit of if you’re only using a single app. But personally, I think that the carousel of apps along the side is a *great* replacement for command+tab when you’re using your iPad, you know, *as a tablet*. Command+tab is great, but it requires a keyboard, and the entire point of the iPad is that you don’t always have one.

>	Some apps don’t work as well in Stage Manager and are hard to use simultaneously with others

Yes, true. Not sure how that’s solved by just doing macOS style multitasking, though. Stage Manager isn’t the problem here, it is developers not having updated their apps yet (it’s a beta, maybe wait until they’ve had time?) - and to be fair, the article is right in that some devs won’t bother because Apple has kept the number of devices that can use it so small. That’ll change over time, though - we’ll get there. I don’t want to really turn this into the discussion about whether or not older iPads can/should have stage manager - there’s a hundred other places thta conversation has already been had. Suffice it to say - yes, this is going to cause an adoption problem over the short term. But again, macOS style multitasking won’t change that.

>	The system confusingly moves windows around when you drag one of them. Sometimes it resizes windows incorrectly. And Stage Manager hides window controls—like a close button—behind a menu. It also often swaps the corner in which the resize indicator sits. 

I love that it moves the windows. It’s a great solution to floating windows on a smaller screen. It does this to prevent you from ever totally covering a window and losing a way to bring it back with just a tap, which is important for a device that is sometimes touch-only, because you can’t work around that problem with a keyboard shortcut at all times like you can on a Mac, and gestures are already kind of overloaded as it is. I actually think it needs to be *more* aggressive - I do sometimes still end up with stuff completely covered up.

The “controls hidden behind a menu” thing hasn’t bothered me yet - I guess I get the complaint, but there’s not much room up there for easily tappable buttons, so I suspect that a single menu that has to be expanded works better for touch than three separate buttons does. It’s also something that isn’t generally as important as it is on a Mac, in my opinion. I don’t find myself closing windows as often because I don’t find myself having to “clean up” as frequently. But maybe that’s just me.

As for the resize corner swapping - it’s trying to move itself into the easiest-to-grab section of the window. Again, this system is designed to work well even for pure touch, and also has to adapt to screen rotation. I understand why it moves, though I get that’ll be a learning curve.

“Sometimes it resizes windows incorrectly” is also a complaint I have, but it seems like a bug. I don’t really think it’s fair to say that a traditional macOS style solution wouldn’t also be buggy at first.

>	I think that Apple will ultimately need to give in and make multitasking on the iPad more like the Mac, but I can’t help but feel that one reason they’ve declined to do so is to push users to own both types of devices. 

I sure hope they don’t, and I again couldn’t disagree more. This is an attempt at solving two main problems with window management on an iPad - 1., remain touch responsive at all times as is expected (thus the max window limit), and 2., make a system that works pretty much in its entirety even if all you have as input is touch. We’ve seen what “just take your existing window manager and put it on a tablet” looks like - it’s the desktop experience in Windows tablets, and I *hate* it. For years people have been clamoring for Apple to do what Microsoft has done, but to “make it actually good, because you’re Apple”. Stage Manager is their attempt at exactly that. Now is not the time to look at what they’ve come up with and say “never mind, give me the other experience that I know is crappy for touch, just so that I can have something that is familiar if I do happen to have a keyboard plugged in”. Does it have problems? Sure. But I want Apple to forge forward and tackle those issues directly, not give up.


They could just turn the Macbook Air into a 2 in 1 by adding a touch screen and pencil support, this will encourage more developers to make their iOS apps available on M series Macs as well. But apple wants you to buy both an iPad and a MacBook so I don't see them going this road in the near future.


I really want split-screen on iphone (fine if it's only the regular or plus sized models).

Yesterday I wanted to send a voice message to my friend of me singing a song to which I didn't really know the lyrics, so I wanted safari + messages open at the same time so I could read and record it but you can't do it. Just one stupid example =p


I would be happy if stage manager simply had 3 controls to manage window like close minimize and maximize


I had an iPad Pro 11” 2018 that was somewhat of a secondary companion device to my iPhone 12 Pro and MacBook Air M1.. It wasn’t used a lot but I liked it well enough. When Stage Manager was announced I was really excited and thought I could make the iPad more of a primary device. However, obviously, it didn’t work on my iPad. I sold it and bought a used 12.9” M1 iPad Pro figuring it’ll be a laptop type device so may as well go big. However, after trying the beta, I really realized it just isn’t good and I kinda hate the whole concept. 

I ended up selling the iPad again. I just use my iPhone and MacBook for everything and don’t miss the lack of an iPad at all to be honest. I’ll use the proceeds from the iPad sales to go towards the iPhone 14 Pro.


That's what happens when you try hard to reinvent the wheel only to not give users what they want.


I think what annoys me the most is I can’t actually resize to any size I want, and I can move the windows to anywhere I want. The windows snap to obscure most of the content in the windows underneath. I can’t just have a window partially obscure another window. It has to be greater than 25% or nothing. It’s soooolol frustrating to work in.


The title of this post gets reposted every year lmao


cmon apple just let me install osx. Right now my ipad is mostly my dedicated hearthstone machine


Apple, you assholes, put macOS on the iPad Pro at least. It’s the biggest POS.


Stage manager is a poor solution to a problem that's already been solved for decades. Just bring the same Mac window management to iPad with the close, minimize, and maximize buttons and being able to have as many apps on screen as you want. You can position and resize them anywhere.


I haven’t tried Stage Manager but reading the opinion piece makes it clear that the writer is exclusively focused on usage with a keyboard while there are many who will use this simply by touch.


I don’t even know where to begin on how it’s not revolutionizing anything, no one asked for it and it creates more software layer while educating users on split screen, 4 fingers gestures was already plenty.

Now it does help turning iPads into computers but for the execution is just so bad.

Could have gone with opening apps based on focuses, making sure Full screen apps appear in a the same order in Mission Control, etc etc.

Instead they created a new way of working that no power users asked for, not fixing what we reported for half decade and far for intuitive for people coming from windows and regular users. 

The worst part is that apparently, it’s a feature that was in the fridge for a long time and engineers always came back to it trying to perfect it. I’m a user researcher and it baffles me that a company like Apple a shit ton of researchers far better than me seem to not have asked their thousands of own employee how they work around with macOS. 

But I know thy when these things happen, there’s a long term picture: an iPad that semi-behave like a computer.


People want iPads to be computers so bad for some reason. Like just buy a MacBook? What am I missing?


I’m subscribing to the theory that it’s a test branch for their AR/VR OS, where the somewhat clunky visual switching is going to be necessary. Then, they’ll have a polished system for when the AR glasses come out next year.


I really don’t think it’s necessary, the current system is enough for a tablet device. I’d you want something more productive just get a Mac.


Stage Manager is decent but I will be honest it is not good lmao


Bad iteration over bad iteration I really wish Apple finally admit that the good old window management we use on desktop (basically on every platform) since 30 years is the best we can get and adapt it on iPad. It is absolutely sure that it will happen some time but please don't waste another 5 years to admit it.


Even using it on the MacBook pro is fucking horrid. I thought it was going to be a proper replacement for having to swipe between the 6 desktops I need, but it’s sooo annoying and slow to setup the “stages” that I stopped using it.


Stage manager is great on MacOS.

I just turned off the setting which makes it show all of the time. I also moved my dock to the right.

It's so nice being able to move my mouse to the left edge and quickly click to the app/window I need.


This is what drove me to get a surface pro 8. I hate having 2 devices that overlap each other a lot. I really wish the iPad Pro could have macOS.


Apple doesn’t innovate, they just wait and see what competition does and takes years to copy what they do and have the gall to say they do it perfect


I really like it when my iPad is connected to a big monitor. I like how it tries to keep apps next to each other by resizing them automatically and everything. I can see why others don’t like that though. 

But the screen on my iPad Air is too small for it to be effective for me on the iPad itself. So I just turn it off and use the old way when not connected to a monitor.


This is entirely predictable. People have to be careful what they wish for. After years of loud voices begging for a “docked mode” we literally get exactly that - and they don’t like it.

I just don’t see a way that a windowing paradigm fits on a class of devices that go from 7.9” to 12.9”


I like it. It’s intuitive and I can’t wait to have stage manager on my laptop. It’s made for an external display and connected mouse and keyboard. When im using it as a tablet I simply toggle stage manager off. I do prefer the old multitasking when using it as a tablet but you can 100% do that. Tim Apple doesn’t show up and put a gun to your head and make you use stage manager. Its simply an option and I don’t understand the hate.


Lots of negativity here which is fine. 

I’ll say, really like it, I’m definitely going to be turning it on and leaving it on

Still a lot of polishing that’s needed though


Probably because it still is a freaking tablet and not portable mini iMac.


I’m not saying this solution is good or bad, but this article posits that making the Mac multitasking system the experience on iPad is naïve and ridiculous. It’s unusable. There’s evidence to support this from companies outside of Apple, too. 

Final thoughts: if you want a Mac UI, buy a Mac. iPad is great at what it does, and eventually they’ll find a multitasking UI that really works. At least they’re trying now!


IPad will always be just behind Mac on certain features.

The closer it gets to being an equal the more it risk cutting into low end Mac sales.

They will never let an IPad be a proper Mac replacement. They will let it get close to tease you with what is possible and intice you to buy an actual Mac.


I just want a tiling window manager. Like Linux has had for decades. 

Well, it’s not **all** I want, because I also want to run emacs locally on the normal local file system so I can finally have a web dev machine and tablet experience all in one. 

But, I’ll take the tiling widow manager as a first step.


Yes it does. Having different apps on the iPad and display, along with the display being fully utilized is all the iPad really needed for effective multitasking. It’s a bit clunky currently, but does it IS a huge leap forward and miles better than any iteration of external display support before Stage Manager.


I wish my 2017 IPad Pro 10.5 would be able to use this. I think my iPad is considerably faster than my 2011 MacBook Pro. I am able to run Monterey ON MY DAMN MAC. JUST GIVE ME STAGE MANAGER. IK MY IPAD IS CAPABLE. MY MAC CAN DO MORE MULTITASKING. Ok… done


Since Jobs nothing of note at all. Emoji’s and rainbows.


The iPad is basically an idiot proof computer, not a substitute for a Mac.

Still, I think they should just let enthusiasts dual boot MacOS and be done with it.


I continue to hope that Apple will make touchscreen macs for those that really want them, and leave the iPad alone for those who prefer it as is.


Nope. Stage Manager is garbage. Apple needs to just bite the bullet and release MacOS for the M1 and higher iPad line and stop trying to play this stupid stratification game already.


I agree. Turned it off already on my (otherwise extremely buggy) ios16 public beta. Kinda regret having even tried this, it's that useless.


Just friggin buy a laptop then.


iPad is not a computer.

iPad is not a computer.

iPad is not a computer.

iPad is not a computer.

iPad is not a computer.

See you in 3 years when this same complaint is posted by "tech lovers" for the 40th time.

iPad is not a computer.


I like it.


Oh no, turns out trying to turn an iPad into a Mac leads to a bad user experience. Who could have possibly seen that coming other than most iPad users?

Anything less than MacOS on an iPad is a joke.


[deleted]


I find my self turning off stage manager more often than not, it actually feels bad resizing windows and finding windows that go behind others(even with the little portion that sticks out). So far it feels like a mixed bag but overall worse than the simpler windowing system.


They should have just made the normal tiled view more usable.


I am personally not upgrading to Ventura.


Money laundering


Lol of course it doesn't. It's an iPad. 

Even with iPad being amazing and powerful, it feels like Apple just doesn't want to unleash that power for users.


Anything is better than the current multitasking system.


Apple has painted themselves into a corner with their weird decision on the iPads. Or they have bad office political problem. Well, they just want you to  buy a Mac and a gimped iPad (and iPhone).


Whats better than merging mac os and ipad os? Selling a mac and and ipad to the same user. Everyone likes the ipad hardware but really just wants it to do run all of the apps that they want. There is no reason for apple to do this when they know a certain percentage will by both. Once they allow ios to run all the apps or mac os to have a touch screen and run all of the ios apps they cannibalize their own market. Sorry to say but its about the money. Not the user


Me who never asked for one 👀


It really needs an app expose so I can see all the apps in the multitasking area at once. The overlapping sometimes hides a window completely and makes it kinda finicky to get back.


Absolute rubbish article by someone who doesn’t know how to use stage manager


This makes me very happy - ipad air 4 users


Yes it does


Apple’s multitasking system on iPad gets me to close wrong Safari windows and lose all those webpages I was thinking to read later without messing my read later list.


I kinda enjoy using the stage manager, it’s not as good as the MacOS multitasking but it’s still pretty good. I also bought the Magic Keyboard recently so it’s a good combination. 
What I don’t enjoy is the apps running in the background. For example, in a mac, when an app is running in the background, it’s just minimized down to the app tray. So when u swipe up with three fingers u only get the apps that u had on display. For iPadOS 16, that doesn’t happen and when you swipe up with three fingers you see all apps that were ever open. 

They need to do something with the app switching, since stage manager only applies to apps it was applied on/apps that were dragged to it, the rest just stays like the way they r on regular iPad.
I am not sure if I got my point across, but if I did, please let me know if someone else is also bugged by it!


Cool. Can we just get proper external display support on the A14 air without this now?


I’ve got to say, I’ve had an amazing experience with Stage Manager. I use my iPad as a daily driver, only have a laptop as an absolute backup. What I can say is that I love that they’ve designed it with the classic ipad feel - things don’t slow down, and they are controlled in enough of a way to be helpful. For example, resizing & moving windows - while not perfect, is intended to help create a desktop environment that’s easier to navigate with only touch.   


The Globe + \~ works to switch between the various windows on the screen - and I’ve been able to get chrome webm & other video apps to run on the screen at the same time. So the multitasking is definitely getting closer to MacOS. I think while Mark has a good point in wanting MacOS…I specifically don’t own a Mac for a reason. Personally while it works great, i prefer windows 11. To achieve that on my ipad I use an app & subsription service called [shadow.tech](https://shadow.tech). 

All in all - since I can already use my ipad like a computer with Shadow, I see Stage Manager as a great middle ground that allows me to experience that snappy & fast experience I’ve come to expect from my iPad. I’m sure that while MacOS on an ipad would probably run decently, we can’t ignore the fact that there are delays and load time depending on what you’ve pushed it to do & the hardware you have. So I do understand the experience they are trying to achieve. Nonetheless…I do think there should be a dual boot option on iPad. And who knows - maybe we’ll get there before you know it. 

In the meantime, one thing I’m super excited about is to see what developers do with all the new features. Everything from custom drivers to backend enhancements that allow more robust desktop class applications to be developed on iPadOS (especially with virtual memory swap) - is going to make iPadOS very impressive. We just have to wait for developers to catch up & see what direction Apple takes it next year.   


Another component I would mention that I love - Stage Manager can have 4 app groups on the side; however, it can have endless app groups in the app switcher. Which means the multi-tasking capabilities have vastly improved. I have a workspace for finance, various specific work activities, entertainment, and more. I’ve also really loved how they have implemented the show all windows feature within stage manager. I noticed the beta 3 re-release with the new build number happened to have fixed that feature.   


We’ll see what the final design ends up looking like - but all I know is that I’m enjoying the experience thus far. :)


Really surprising Apple messed this up.   But I can't imagine they will not fix it.


Was thinking of getting a new iPad just to have the M1 chip but will hold off. My Mac is for serious work. My iPad is for media consumption and music jamming.


It does, its very good


When I watched WWDC I thought this feature looked to stupid and that I would never use it.  Looks like it sucks even for those who were intending to use it.


I know this discussion is about Stage Manager on iPad OS, but it’s also just as fruitless on the Mac at best, and confusing & fruitless at worst. Windows minimize onto the side no different than they would into the dock if you choose to turn Stage Manager off & use the Mac in the more traditional workflow. 

I’m not sure I get the point of brining it onto the Mac at all other than the feature is already written into the unified OS all of Apple’s devices share now. Worst of all, it occupies screen real estate unless you opt for the minimizing effect which again, is no different than what the dock already offers. 

I’m sure if Steve were alive, we wouldn’t see such redundancy in the OS’ user experience as we do today. Oh well.


Once Bill Gates killed Steve Jobs Apple kind of stopped being Apple.


Unfortunate but glad so I can buy the mini without regrets


I can’t help but chuckle and shake my head at everyone saying they should just make the iPad run MacOS or whatever. 

I have a MacBook if I want to type a lot/use the keyboard. I have an iPad Pro if I want to watch movies, record music, or read. I have no idea why they need to do the same things.


Colors are washed out because it’s sending out an “HDR” color profile. You can turn it off in the stage manager display settings on the iPad and then unplug the iPad and replug it back in and it’ll look normal. Happened to me too. I agree with everything you said.


For moving apps to the external monitor; if you click on the 3 dots at the top of the window there is an option to move the app to the external monitor (or the iPads screen), not the most intuitive method but the option is there.


Agreed, I disliked it so much that I downgraded back to iPad OS 15. Hoping they rework some stuff for the production release.


It’s possible the iPad increases brightness without increasing contrast on the external display, and True Tone might be further messing up the colour (since that would use the iPads camera)


lol - just give me a coverflow interface where the app in focus takes up most of the screen minus the edges where I can roll through active apps quickly


I downloaded the beta for iOS on my MacBook m1 pro, specifically to see how useful studio manager would be. It’s not useful at all. It’s no faster imo than using folders or desktop icons, and the lack of controlling placement of windows is very annoying.


It’s still an early beta, and some of the intended features and behaviors aren’t implemented yet. For example, Apple said that dragging and dropping windows between the iPad and external display is part of stage manager, but that simply isn’t implemented in the current beta yet.


My external looks like shit on my MacBook m1 pro compared to my Surface book Laptop for work


“Users complain about first release of software shocker, meanwhile at 10, the pope is indeed Catholic, find out more..”


On the other hand, Stage Manager on MacOS is fantastic.

> Aren’t iPads more powerful than original Mac osX devices sold in the early 2000’s?

Current iPads are like 90%+ as powerful as current (well, last gen now) Macs.

> Why cant they support the level multitasking we saw in that era?

Because it is important to them to keep Macs different from iPads.


>Aren’t iPads more powerful than original Mac osX devices sold in the early 2000’s?

Worse, Pro iPads are nearly as powerful as an M1 Macbook Pro, they have the same CPU. The hardware could even handle Mac OSx.


Because that multitasking was made for mouse and keyboard with a 1x1 pixel accuracy for clicking. Touch input has 44x44 pixel. That multitasking would completely suck on the iPad.


Mouse and keyboard? And memory/swap as well.

The big nut to crack is how to make a more powerful *touch* UI that is also easy to use. I have never seen anyone do so (no MS haven’t, they haven’t cracked GUIs in general yet).

I frankly don’t see Apple having it in them to do so. They are in such a rut these days. What I think needs to happen (and this is just my opinion) is a heavy pull down to 3-5 years between OS. Separate release schedules for apps. Focus on fixing things that doesn’t work well vs new shiny toy for presentation.

Then the last big one. Hire more people. Hire a full iPadOS team to make a new tablet touch UI that blows our minds. It must be better than anything I can come up with, or anything I’ve seen mocked up. Think the jump from blackberry to iPhone. And the team needs someone in charge that is exceptional.

Okay. Forget  4K or even HD video. Further >10 megapixel images. Forget rich Web content. Now you can multitask but you can’t do any of those things.


Because iPads are not laptops. They’re for different purposes and different audiences. iPads are already the best tablets in the market by a huge margin, they are great at what they do. Same thing with Macs, they’re different categories.


it's crazy to me. before whatever came after snow leopard, macos was like linux—it would run beautifully on, like, any computer. i even had an underpowered hackintosh at one point that ran great, even photoshop was pretty usable!

i feel like now devs make so much money, they only really target super high end machines (eg. whatever overspecc'd beast they daily drive), and testing on lower powered devices (if that even happens) just isn't the same. vs, like, 15-20 years ago everyone was broke and programming on older computers.

i just think no one, app or OS developers or whatever, really gives a shit about low memory management. like, the proliferation of javascript… i have a 2015 mbp, and some websites just chug. i can't have too too many reddit tabs open with RES, or my browser likes to kernel panic my whole computer. there's similar addons for twitch (i think i tried maybe betterttv and another one, forgetting now), and they are literally unusable. like, if i tried to open one twitch tab with bttv, my entire computer became a slideshow. and i have 16GB of ram! i guess it's also just a dual-core…


M1 iPads are way more powerful than most Intel Macs sold until a couple years ago. Apple are desperately trying to convince their users they need to buy both a Macbook and an iPad because the latter shouldn't replace the former: that's fine for the base iPad, which is reasonably cheap, not for an M1 iPad, especially the absurdly overpriced 12,9" Pro.


They can. Early 2000s Macs were slooowwww when they had multiple things up.


>Multitasking has basically been perfected on other systems, yet this new system has come out massively worse than what is already available elsewhere.

Mmm not really, window rezsing sucks on Mac OS, the green window button is useless.


When you say that multitasking has been perfected on other systems, you mean systems with mouse and keyboard navigation and apps that are mostly made for small precision touch targets. The reality on iPadOS is that apps are made in a very different way than for regular operating systems, so it makes sense that the multitasking system is also different.

Multitasking on macOS for most people just means having all apps open at the same time behind each other, so I wouldn't really call that perfect.


It was actually designed for Macs way back in 2007. https://techreflect.net/2022/06/rising-from-the-ashes-stage-manager/


I don’t agree that multitasking has been perfected on other systems. 

I work in the tech industry and and regularly use both macOS and Windows, and I usually have over a dozen windows open. I also have three screens. All methods of multitasking get the job done but they also all have drawbacks.  I find context switching to be a particularly bad drawback for most of them. 

I haven’t used stage manager on Mac yet but I’m excited to try it because I like how it keeps a little visual preview of window groups constantly on the side which I think will help with context switching. And I at least like that Apple appears to be trying to innovate with regard to window management.


> It feels like the new system for ipads has been designed specifically to be different to those on MacOS

That seems like the only objective honestly, different for the sake of being different. They didn't want to make it more Mac OS like on purpose. I'm sure this is being done so they can continue to hope people buy both devices because if they made iPad OS too good at multitasking, it'd probably pull some sales away from the Mac line.

As the article says, Apple doesn't even pretend to think it's a good solution, so much so that you have to enable it yourself.


It feels like Apple is doing this on purpose because they are afraid of iPads cannibalizing Macs.


Moom is the answer.


I feel like a lot of the things Apple has been doing is change for the sake of change. Like the App Library. I don't want Apple's "smart" categories, I just want things sorted alphabetically by the default


>	Different for the sake of being different

Apple reinvented mouse cursors for the iPad so yeah.


You nailed it. I had the beta on my iPad for a day or two but had app issues so I downgraded. I don’t miss it one bit. They completely missed on this feature.


That is the main reason I am not as devastated about it not coming to non-M1 ipads.


Basically the issue is apple doesn’t want to canabaloze mac sales.  They want to sell you both.  So I’m doing so they gimp the iPads interface.  I always tell people that a Mac is still a much better purchase than an iPad if you can only afford one.


Think different?


They brought that same system to MacOS. I think this is the way forward that Apple sees.


I think it’s a system that will work well in ar, which will give a similar feel between all computing platforms.


“Perfected” on other systems? To me this feels like copy and paste before Apple came out with their iOS implementation. Other mobile platforms had a variety of ways to copy and paste while the iPhone had nothing, but once Apple implemented their version of copy and paste every other mobile OS followed it precisely.

Apple hasn’t quite reached the same level with multitasking as they did with copy and paste but it’s a much more daunting task and their first efforts are… decent for a touch-focused OS.


>	Multitasking has basically been perfected on other systems

Not for touch it hasn’t. I haven’t used or seen a nice solution to this for tablets - yes, Dex included. Stage Manager is the best of the bunch so far, despite its issues that it needs to work through, because it works pretty well when in a pure touch mode.

I guess I get that some people want their iPad to be a traditional tablet until they plug in a keyboard, and then they want it to be a laptop, but I want it to be more even in tablet mode, and that’s what Stage Manager delivers.


Love it or hate it, it’ll be the same between iPad and MacOS.


WIMP has many flaws and if you can’t see that then you lack imagination. I’m annoyed by window organization and multitasking on my Mac everyday.


If you lack a wired mouse or a Apple-produced cursor input, you do not have UEFI access on a macOS system because they lean that hard on touch input.

Meaning, if you have a wired keyboard, you literally need to buy another device if you want to reinstall macOS for any reason, to say nothing of if you want to drive Linux on that hardware, which actually runs the M2 faster than macOS does. They make beautiful devices, but I feel like I’m outgrowing their parental instincts. No one should *have* to touch a mouse if they are a keyboard power user, & that isn’t possible on macOS currently. Try turning off Night Mode without a mouse.

It’s silly.


iPads aren’t computers. If you need a computer with a full desktop OS designed to be used with keyboard and mouse, get that instead.

Apple will never go for a half baked desktop mode like Dex shoehorned into their devices. Or putting MacOS in a tablet with a clearly different use case.


Not really for the sake of being worse but for the sake of being primarily used by touch not mouse.


It's different in that it has to simultaneously support touch gestures and mouse input. That's an extreme limitation, and IMO it results in an overall bad experience


Agreed.  I have a teacher friend that is excited to have their “perfect grail”’device.   Tablet for walking around and assessing or presenting wirelessly, working with it as a “laptop” with the magic keyboard, or, plugged into a bigger screen to be used with a full keyboard and mouse.  In their case, since it’s all web-based software, or existing iPadOS apps, they’re set; but for someone who’s already PC or Mac based, it still may not cut it.


It’s almost as if this sort of multitasking doesn’t belong on tablets but on laptops and desktops instead. Who would have thought that trying to turn an iPad into a Mac was a bad idea?


You don’t have to turn stage manager on. Apple itself said there’s now just multiple ways to multi task.


This subreddit is not a reflection of the market. Far from it. This will have zero negative impact on sales. 

Not sure why people think internet geeks complaints at all reflect normal users.


I love it. Apple has admitted it’s not for everyone, but I think there will be plenty of people who like the feature. Also, this is only Apple’s plan backfiring if you believe that the point of all of this was to drive hardware upgrades, which I honestly do not believe. They’re not hard up for cash. Driving a one-time short term bump in hardware sales won’t do shit for them. They make decisions for the long term health of the company, and making some of your users feel slighted just so that some others will upgrade a year or two prematurely would never have been worth the risk if that’s what it was about.


With the new lock screen not coming to iPadOS this year, what even is the killer feature for non-M1 iPads to upgrade? The weather app?


They don’t want people to upgrade for the feature, that’s just Reddit kids who have to have the latest toys. Anyone who owns an iPad today does not need stage manager. Period. They are evolving the platform to be more capable, but why in the would would you have bought an A series iPad if you needed a full fledged laptop?


We don't actually know what the majority of iPad users think about Stage Manager.


I’ve been using Personal Hotspot on iPhone + Mac and it’s been just fine, though of course built-in cellular that doesn’t drain both devices’ batteries would be nice.

I’ve also been trying to make iPad my “weekend getaway machine” for years, and I’m ready to give up. Window management is only half the issue; I also miss Alfred, clipboard history, a color picker, screen capture, and all my system-level screenshots that help me fly around my Mac. 

I won’t miss the iPad much, I think I just hate being the guy on trips who always has his laptop, even if I’m just reading a book and taking some notes.


True, the iPad is still a consumption device for me. For my line of work, hard to get any actual work done other than maybe reading some documentation or responding to a few emails, which I can do on my phone any way.


Same exact boat


I fucking hate the split screen on an iPad. It makes Books almost impossible to use, because “turn page” is too close to “switch out of the app I’m actively using to some random thing on the right”

Or, tap at the top of Safari to jump all the way to the top of the page pops out this 3-way menu instead.

Why the ever-loving fuck it wasn’t made optional I do not know. I like my iPad Pro, but forcing this multitasking down my throat is a massive downgrade.


The only way this ever happens is if MacOS is redesigned for touch which please dear god I hope this never happens.


[deleted]


They just want people to buy two devices. They can work out small UI issues, they just don’t want too


As someone with an old iPad who was considering upgrading to the new iPad Air, I’m glad for all of these controversies. Makes it really clear to me that entry-level iPad is the only tablet I should consider. Im not a Pro and have no need for any M1 based iPad. The whole Stage Manager issue really highlighted that for me.


Truly wild that a touch based tablet is still a large touch based device


This is the correct response. I wouldn’t limit it to iOS and iPadOS though. macOS is similarly getting more and more glitchy and bloated. I’ll never leave my Mac unless I’m forced to bc windows doesn’t meet my needs. The hardware is unparalleled for apple. I feel like a group of high school computer nerds could build much better software.


Sooner or later they’re going to have to make the iPad software much more sophisticated. It doesn’t have to be a Mac on an iPad. It just needs to be a fully functional computing tool made possible on an iPad, in a way that works for the iPad. It’s got the power and the form factor to support it. 

My hope is that all the time they’re taking to slow walk it in that direction, learning what is and isn’t working along the way, will inevitably lead to a very deliberate and thoughtful result.


Ok, so ditch the ipad pro and only sell the base 329€ model, which is overkill for a “simple computer”


One has touch screen, one doesn’t. It could be on par with air or previous year’s air and have the mbp and air be the stronger devices for users who want more power over a touch screen


>and leave the truly pros to use Mac.

Then what the heck is an iPad Pro... the M1 iPad Pro even has pro hardware in it. Even average PC users don't need an M1.


What’s a computer?


You can’t even turn off the screen because it shuts off the monitor connected.

So much wasted energy for a company claiming to be green. Ew.


Yea but I thought they said each product should challenge the product above it. Looks like that’s not happening here.


Yet, it doesn’t work in clampshell mode (i.e. with the iPad screen turned off.


Damn, is that Settings App as big as it can get on the internal screen?


Samsung DeX is a gold mine.


I'm probably getting the S23 since it will finally have the Snapdragon (3rd world German here) with every day i'm getting more annoyed with the Apple Ecosystem/iOS in general.


Your $1000-$2000 was not enough. Give us more money 

-Tim


The zoom button isn’t synonymous with maximize. It’s zoom to fit content. It’ll expand as large as it needs to so that the window fits the content comfortably.


MacOS isn’t meant to be used with a touchscreen. Why would you want something poorly implemented like that?


I use it more than my laptop. About 90% more. I find it very convenient. I think it’s more that people won’t spend the time to figure out how to use it.


Ya I’ve gone through so many iPads at this point, always trying to find a reason to use them, but ultimately end up going back to my MacBook Pro and iPhone for pretty much everything (including ebooks).

The only thing I use my iPad for is mounting it on my refrigerator for recipes when I’m cooking, or watching media when traveling.


iPad for college note taking and such is a beast, pretty much unrivaled.


>Yea, that’d be nice if it worked well. Apple claims it doesn’t, and that they have to limit the number of running apps so that every app remains immediately responsive to touch no matter the circumstances.

Hard to believe that when the mM in is Macbook Pros and they are allowed to run as many apps as you can open. I would not put it past apple to lie about hardware capabilities.

>I love that is moves the windows. It's a great solution to floating windows on a smaller screen. It does this to prevent you from totally covering a window and losing a way to bring it back with just a tap.

This problem is already solved on Windows and Mac. You just click on the app in the taskbar or in the dock to go back to a screen that is hidden. You can even do that on an iPad. You can even do that on stage manager, click on the docked item brings the app into focus. So not sure why we aren't allowed to put apps anywhere we want aside from the aspect you mentioned..


[deleted]


It’s crazy to think that iPhones are the only modern smartphones that don’t support such basic features like split screen (and AOD, which I miss a lot)


Be patient, it’s still in beta


That is my observation as well. All of the things that they’re complaining about are the way they are so that they can work well for touch.


Ppl want all in one system.


Macbooks have no touch screen, no ability to draw or write, and an attached keyboard, so no tablet mode.


A touch screen.


My iPad is great for consuming a single piece of content at a time, but there current multitasking options are mediocre at best. I just want to be able to freely open a couple windows at the same time. I can have runescape+a browser+a PiP video all at the same time, but just overlaying them all sucks. It'd be nice to have some way to actually tile them


I had the Surface Pro 4 and now use a MacBook and iPad Air. I honestly love a lot of things about the Apple ecosystem but I always find myself missing the Surface.


Tempted to move over to Samsung for this very reason


>This is entirely predictable. People have to be careful what they wish for. After years of loud voices begging for a “docked mode” we literally get exactly that - and they don’t like it.

Just because Stage Manager has limited improvements over the old iPad multitasking method doesn't mean that some other windowed approach wouldn't satisfy those people. I think people wanted a system that was more or less the same as windows on the Mac, and if we got that, then there likely wouldn't be so many complaints (especially from Gurman, who specifically wanted the Mac window approach on the iPad). 

>I just don’t see a way that a windowing paradigm fits on a class of devices that go from 7.9” to 12.9”

Stage Manager shows a column of icons on the left side of the display that takes up space. Even though these icons can be hidden, it does show that if anything, Stage Manager is *less* suited for smaller devices than Mac-style windowing.


> I can’t wait to have stage manager on my laptop.

I played around with it on my MBP, and to me it feels redundant with Spaces/Mission Control. It's a slightly different visual, but it's exposing the same functionality.


And ahead of them on others. 

It’s almost like they are different devices


Have you tried macOS on an iPad using sidecar?

Anyone who wants that experience doesn’t deserve an opinion.


The iPad is not a Mac, so stop trying to make it a thing.


If you want a Mac, buy a Mac.


Define "computer" - because I'm really not sure if "has a modern desktop OS windowing system" should really be a valid sticking point.


>	turn an iPad into a Mac 

That’s not what this is, hun


Some want full macOS in the iPad Pro. I think that would completely ruin the whole thing. Weird lol


Jony gave us the Butterfly keyboard.


They’ll never put macOS on an iPad. If they did, why would someone buy a Mac if they can just buy an iPad and dock it


What’s funny is people acting like this scenario was impossible before stagemanager when you could split screen Reddit & telegram, slideover Twitter, and have the game on PiP no problem before


You do realize that stage manager is completely optional right? In case that’s what’s holding you back


Why does HDR make things washed out on displays? It’s so broken that I disable it on everything that tries to use it.


yeah but this only moves it over to the external display by itself so its not really a solve… what they want is to be able to drag it like you do on macOS and theyre 100% right. 

The fact you cant easily move multiple apps and collections between the screenx is such an oversight its shocking.


You downgraded just because of stage manager?


Aren't you already able to do that with touch gestures?

Edit: Had to double check but 5 finger sliding left of right switches between the apps.


You think the user experiences on Macs and iPads are “almost entirely the same at this point”?


I agree, and it’s sad! I think I’d actually love an iPad m1 as my main development machine during the day (with usb c external screen and peripherals) and reading a book at night.

Hardware wise, this thing could replace my desktop, laptop and current iPad. It’s just the software that’s holding it back, and that’s sad…


I won’t buy an iPad until they figure this out. I don’t see how I could replace my Mac with an iPad as a general computing/productivity device. Sure it’s great for media consumption and note taking in college. But basic things like moving files around in folders, dragging them from one app to another, etc. is so clunky on iPad OS.


>Because it is important to them to keep Macs different from iPads.

&#x200B;

That could be true but Apple has gone to the effort to make the iPad and Mac cross-compatible in some areas like screen sharing, mirroring, and also allowing iPad apps on the Mac. So Apple is intentionally bluring the lines here rather than a sharp line in the sand. Also Apple has said countless times its not concerned with canibalizing it's own products; it's goal is just to have people buy its products.

That said I think Apple is taking half measures here in regard to the full potential iPads could be. And a convertible MacBook Air/iPad  seems like a product the market is ready to embrace and would be a much better solution I think than the iPad + Magic Keyboard.


> it is important to them to keep Macs different from iPads \*

\* Except in terms of price.

I actually think that for what most people do with an iPad, they're grossly overpowered and therefore overpriced. It would be a different story if Apple actually just let them run macOS, but as they seem obstinately determined to make sure that you can only do mobile things on them, they should just let them be cheap and low-powered.

There is literally nothing that I do on my iPad Air that I wasn't doing just fine on my iPad 3 (the first one I bought).


>	Because it is important to them to keep Macs different from iPads.

Disagree.


There’s an old business term for it, which is called “cannibalism”.

You don’t want to have one of your products devour another.  If iPads had the same capability as the mac, nobody would buy the mac, that whole division of the company dies.  Ergo, the iPad eats the mac.


the photo from Apple is literally an IPad connected to a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.  So clearly they are suggesting users should use their product with mouse and keyboard.


I don't know about that: Samsung has a really good multitasking system.


iPads support mouse and keyboards, but provide limited UX support.


They need someone like Scott Forstall to come back (I'm not joking)


If apple literally didn’t put a desktop chip in the iPad I agree with you. But as it stands there is nothing stopping apple from making the iPad Air and Pro a MacBook.


My biggest gripe moving from windows to Mac OS.


[deleted]


There was a time where you could only resize from the bottom right hand corner. So if your window was lower in the screen and you wanted to make it bigger, you had to drag the window to the top of the screen first, so you'd have enough room to drag the window down, and then grab the right hand corner and pull.


BTT FTW


The green button is amazing! Full screen to revert & option plus green snaps it display height and just the exact amount of width the app needs, effectively enabling split views…


TIL the green window button, which I utilize several times a day, every day, is "useless."


If you hold command while pressing it i believe it gives you full screen.

Edit; it’s actually option.


[deleted]


Why is the green window button useless? It makes the window fullscreen.

And on Longpress you put it on the right or left half of the screen and can select a window/app for the other half.


I think he simply means freeform windows, like on Android.

See Dex for example.


Why isn't there a tiling mode then if its supposed to be based around touch controls? Why is the user expected to manage window layouts with their fingers?


Real poweruser multitasking on osx is multiple virtual screens. That part of os is perfected and opens up a universe of possibilities as soon as you start to use it. But, as you said, most people just open all apps behind each other, because most users can't be bothered to learn a simplest part of os.


Dex definitely isn’t perfect and is often used with mouse. Windows have definitely not cracked the “tablet as a laptop”. It’s both a horrible tablet with a dreadful UI and a fairly average laptop experience for the money


I don’t get to do “real work” on my Mac anymore, aside from my hobby stuff, but having tried it out a little you’ve pretty much nailed it.

In practice it’s Spaces with visual preview, and works very well.


Try i3wm on Linux


Imo you already have a pretty similar thing on macOS with MissionControl and spaces. Stage Manager only takes screen space imo. So I don’t think I would use it on the Mac. On the iPad imo it’s great.


>I think will help with context switching.

It probably does help with that for people who need it. Sucks for those who don't as it wastes space. Even on a 12.9 in pro it takes up more than you'd want. Hopefully it will be hideable by drag or something on release, unless that's already a feature and I don't know it.

I probably wouldn't evne use it on my ipad anyways. The lack of freely being able to place apps wherever and however I want ruins it for me. It doesn't serve much benefit over side by side.

The one weird thing I don't get is why does Stage manager even needs its own preview bar on the side. I would have liked to see it integrated into the already existing dock.


Are you aware that they are shipping the exact same system on MacOS and it will likely be the default soon? 

And even if it were true (it is not) that iPad and MacOS window managers were going to be different, give people a little more credit. Nobody is going to buy a MacBook just because of the window manager it has. It’s like saying Porsche uses different wiper blades on the Cayman and 911 to “force” people to buy both cars. The world does not work that way.


If they wanted Stage Manager to be different from macOS they wouldn’t have also added it to macOS. They clearly want to get to a cohesive UX but they don’t feel like what they have currently on macOS works well for touch (I agree).

I think people are really overreacting here. It actually does behave mostly like window management on macOS if you want it to - the only difference once you hide the dock and side tab is that it slightly constrains the set of window sizes you can have (I say slightly because while it’s finite instead of infinite, there are still tons of options and I’ve yet to find something I wanted that I couldn’t do), and the windows slightly reposition over one another. I personally really enjoy that feature and hope it comes to Ventura as well, but whether you like it or not, the point is to make sure windows are always accessible to touch so that you don’t “lose” them behind other windows - when operating in a fully touch mode, you don’t have keyboard shortcuts to get your covered-up windows back.

Yes, there’s also the 4-window limit, but they claim that is about responsiveness so I don’t think that they’d be lifting it even if they just went totally free-floating.


I know it is not the default but you can click on the search bar and have an alphabetical list. However, I really like the smart categories. They are actually quiet useful.


They have said on stage that they are leaving in all the options and you pick what works for you.


Rumors [claim](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-06-12/apple-s-aapl-ios-16-carplay-is-precursor-to-apple-car-wwdc-2022-recap-l4bczhc6) that the upcoming AR/VR headset will have an extended Mac display feature that may be related to Stage Manager.

I suspect that, for better or for worse, Stage Manager will be the only window management system that will be available on *all* of Apple's large-screened devices: the iPad, Mac, and headset/glasses (of course the physical display will be small, but it'll look big while wearing it).


>  I haven’t used or seen a nice solution to this for tablets 

Windows 8 on the surface pro line was actually the best I have ever used, hands down.

Especially when you used it with a little program that turned the whole screen into a giant trackpad for a mouse... it was incredibly functional.


Lmao no you just called stage manager the best of the bunch. Samsung tablets have a much better multitasking system even without Dex. They can actually use apps in windows and the windows can be changed to whatever size and placed wherever. Literally light-years ahead of this bullshit stage manager.


Am I the teacher friend you’re talking about?!? Because the Is is literally me. I use an iPad mini + m1 MacBook Air combo for teaching. I use the iPad constantly and wanna cut the middle man so I really hope stage manager can get the job done so I can just have one machine for teaching. If that’s case I’m definitely getting the 12.9 pro plus magic keyboard and be done with it.


>	turn an iPad into a Mac

This is not what stage manager is but ok


Some people have been pushing for this for so long, I really don’t get it.


Until that option is depreciated….


Some people want an iPad without being obligated to have a designated computer


“How dare you spend $999+ USD on an iPad Pro setup when they’re making a better one next year”
“How dare you act upset that your $1K+ iPad Pro setup from last year is already being artificially locked out of extremely basic computer like multitasking that has existed in underpowered laptops from over a decade ago”


My 2020 iPad should probably get it though


Can't you just swipe anywhere on the page to go to the next one? And you can tap the top of safari on the left or right side to not trigger the 3-way menu.


Damn really never tried to swipe elsewhere to switch pages for books, and tap literally any other part of the top of the screen other than the three dots to scroll to the top.


Let’s not forget that this is still in beta. Things will change as the always do.


I did!


Truly wild that a "Pro" device can't run Pro software (Logic, Final Cut, etc.). Also can't copy and paste a \*\*\*\*ing iCal event.


Metaphorically speaking, groups of high school nerds make Linux; I guess you can load that onto your MacBook and experience all the best that experience has to offer.


Yes, this would be nice. 

However, I suspect they know the longer they cripple the iPad the more iPad+Mac customers they will have, instead of just iPad only customers.

unfortunately apple has lost all their visionaries that were responsible for “deliberate and thoughtful” design.

what we’re only going to get going forward it feature mashing, where teams working in isolation on different things all will get their thing mashed together into a final product.


Why would they need to make that software more sophisticated? The vast majority of people don't need complicated / sophisticated apps on their phones or tablets.


Still a beta feature.


Nah you can make it bigger. You can hide the dock or the side bar. You can even drag it to full screen


>  Apple Ecosystem/iOS

Honestly, after a decade in this ecosystem, I'd probably give Android a try again if literally 95% of my friends weren't also on iPhones, plus I own so many Apple devices, it would be so hard to switch. They've got me right where they want me.


Current snapdragons are quite bad efficiency wise. They overheat quite a bit from what I’ve heard. The 865 was the last good chip from Qualcomm. They aren’t as objectively superior as it used to be.


>	MacOS isn’t meant to be used with a touchscreen. 

iPadOS ~~isn’t~~ wasn’t meant to be used with a trackpad, yet apple sells the Magic Keyboard for iPad. 

>	Why would you want something poorly implemented like that?

As opposed to Stage Manager?


If only Apple sold a keyboard and touchpad accessory for iPad, they could have called it Wizard Keyboard? Or Sorcerer’s keyboard or something.


Is this true? I think most people I know would be more productive on an MBA


Macs aren’t designed to be instantly responsive in all cases. It’s pretty easy to get a Mac into a position where it has high memory pressure and it stops responding even moderately quickly, much less instantly. When there’s an indirection layer between the user and the content (a mouse and keyboard), this is annoying but isn’t awful. I can understand why Apple feels that when the interaction model is touch that these kinds of pauses are unacceptable. 

The dock is visible by default in stage manager but is often hidden if you actually make use of the display. With such a small display, I find that my dock is often hidden. There’s also no substitute for spatial reasoning. When you want “that thing that was over there to the left” it is far, far easier to just tap right on it than it is to remember what app it is and tap that in the dock - assuming it’s even there - that’s not necessarily the case with stage manager. The most recently interacted apps are present to the right of the dock(but depending on display size, not even 4 of them), not the 4 actually on the display. That could of course be changed but comes with trade offs of its own. 

In practice I haven’t found it to be at all an issue that windows slightly (it *is* very slight) reposition themselves automatically. I suppose there are others that feel differently but I honestly believe that a lot of the people complaining about this haven’t given it a fair shot (or even any shot at all). In either case, I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple eventually allows arbitrary positioning of windows - but i sure hope they leave what they have currently in there as an option.


There are lots of windows 2 in 1 laptops that they can copy from, most have a hinge and you can fold the keyboard to the back of the device.


Yea, so a MacBook? Only thing I can think of is that it doesn’t have cellular or Apple Pencil support.


So then buy an iPad if that’s the stuff you prioritize. I just don’t think it’s feasible to have a single device that does everything an iPad AND a Mac can do without alternating between both operating systems, or without having a weird mesh of macOS and iPadOS. It just doesn’t work, at least not without some serious changes to how things are currently set up.


Like I wish my phone didn’t look nearly the same as it did 10 years ago


>It’s almost like they are different devices

I never said they weren't.

Yet they advertise it like a Mac replacement or alternative.



Priced like a Mac, same chipset as a Mac. May as well be a Mac if they’d stop trying to hobble it with the same stupid OS restrictions applied to the 300 dollar base model. Apple went down this path on their own, they just need to climb the fence instead of sitting on it getting splinters.


Why?

A tablet form factor is inherently limited.

https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/form-factor/amp/


Just like a phone is. If you want to do desktop tasks, then you need a workstation form factor.

If you want to do basic mobile 12 inch tasks that don't require a physical keyboard, then an iPad will work.


“Hun”? What are you, a South Carolina diner waitress?

The feature is a revived early 2000’s Mac interface feature that got shelved. It was designed for the Mac, so saying that it’s trying to turn the iPad into a Mac, especially since it’s designed for a keyboard and mouse/trackpad, isn’t far off.


Which didn't even fly


I absolutely do. I will just avoid bloatware for as long as I can hehe


I have no idea. I work in production and I still haven’t yet wrapped my head around HDR completely and why HDR has such a wide representation of different results. The best being real HDR content being viewed on a iPhone 13 with the XDR screen. That stuff is like night and day. Then there’s HDR computer monitors that look like total shit when you turn on HDR mode in display settings on the Mac/iPad. I think a lot of it is “simulated” hdr that’s just increased contrast and saturation. Or the HDR signal isn’t triggering the display go into HDR mode. I know there are levels/ratings of HDR compatible monitors.


Most external monitors offer HDR to check a marketing box, but the hardware isn’t even close to being able to show HDR. The results are predictably bad.

There are some real HDR monitors on the market, but you’re looking at $1000+.


It's a combination of two things:

1. HDR support implementation for ideal conditions on the OS.
2. HDR support of displays ranges from garbage (edge lit LCD) to mediocre (FALD with <1000 zones) to good (OLED, mini-LED >1000 zones).

Because the displays are less than ideal for HDR, a simple "HDR on" toggle like Windows and MacOS use is not a good implementation. Most HDR monitors would be more suited for something like "enable HDR in fullscreen" where it is only enabled for movies/games and otherwise runs in SDR. This of course would cause windowed HDR to not work but would be an acceptable compromise for most.

Instead what the OS does is just run everything in a HDR container and since this puts the display in HDR mode, you end up with this washed image because LCD backlight is now at 100% raising black levels. 

An OLED handles this situation just fine because each pixel can be dimmed individually. In Windows you can also adjust the brightness to match SDR mode but I don't think MacOS has anything comparable.


[removed]


An SDR-only display that gets sent an HDR image will look washed out because it can't read the HDR metadata basically because... well, it doesn't know what to do with it.


The issue has something to do with the color data, when content is shot for HDR specifically it has a much wider range of colors. Typical monitors made for something like rec709 don’t have the same range so you end up missing out on a lot of color data. That and the brightness standards for HDR on SD monitor are completely different with the HDR content requiring specific levels of peak brightness to fully realize the color it’s displaying. In the end you’ll get a more muted image until you playback on a proper HDR display. Rec709 became a standard for color work because most displays could get it in range so if you corrected to a 709 display you’d at least get close to accurate color for your content. But it’s extremely limited by today’s standards.


I agree. I’ve not used the beta yet, but it‘s really unusual to me that an Apple-designed system would require you to dive into menus in order to move something.


While I agree it’s not the most intuitive method it still accomplishes the same thing. My guess is some future update to continuity will allow you move an app to another one of your devices and these are the building blocks for that feature. You can’t easily drag a window to another device, but it’s easy to choose one from a drop down menu so with Stage Manager Apple is setting the groundwork for this feature by changing the way we manage applications between displays and in the future between devices.


Not only reason, it was pretty buggy in other aspects (which I figured going in) but just wanted to see what stage manager was about. The external display support was nice thoughZ


I downgraded because I hate the notification system and the music/video player UI changes.


Stage manager is pretty garbo. I got it just for that and I'm extremely disappointed. It's absolutely useless. The 16gb ram support is nice and definitely noticeable


I help people build PCs and it's unfortunate watching a company do something that I tell so many people not too. I help them build PCs that match their needs and the things they are doing to run on it. I try to keep them from spending too much on higher spec parts if they won't need it now or in the future. On the flip side Apple went the opposite with their pro devices. Went and shoved in powerful hardware on a device that can't even run heavy enough software.

I really hope apple has some multi year plan to get them to be much better but it doesn't seem like it so far.


This is legitimately why I fucking hate modern day Apple and Tim Cook. They are intentionally vastly holding back progress by about a decade if not more simply in the pursuit of profits.


I’d love this too. I don’t need the built in trackpad or keyboard of a laptop because I have better peripherals. 

But the iPad is so limited that I won’t bother buying another iPad Pro 12.9” for my next device but am looking at a MB Air instead.


[deleted]


They have a product for that.  It’s called the MacBook Air. 

I like the iPad being different from the MacBook Air.


> And a convertible MacBook Air/iPad seems like a product the market is ready to embrace and would be a much better solution I think than the iPad + Magic Keyboard.

Doubt it ever happens because of the insane markups on the Magic Keyboards.


> And a convertible MacBook Air/iPad seems like a product the market is ready to embrace and would be a much better solution I think than the iPad + Magic Keyboard.

I don't know why people keep thinking that this is a good idea. MacOS has matured to the point that shoehorning touch is the absolute worst thing that Apple could do. iPadOS still has plenty of room to grow. I can understand people's impatience at the slow progress they've made there but it doesn't justify Apple making the horrible decision of putting MacOS on the iPad or whatever hybrid monstrosity that some people want to see.


I think you missed the *to them* part of that comment.


I agree with you disagreeing. I think it’s that the average user will happilly buy an ipad, but arw far less likely to buy a macbook. They check emails, watch content, maybe draw a bit, maybe edit a bit. A tiny percentage of “power users” who need mac os on an ipad exist in my mind….most of them likely come to this sub which makes it seem like everyone wants mac os on an ipad


What does the system that was designed and produced by Samsung have to do with an Apple product? Eh? Especially in this conversation XD


You got it wrong, it’s actually a mobile chip in a desktop. But either way just because it can run it doesn’t mean it should. My iPhone is more powerful than some windows PC, doesn’t mean it should run a desktop OS.


Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I got this app got *Rectangle* (it's free) and it recreates Windows 10's window snapping shortcuts. I use it a lot when I want to have 2-3 windows side by side (for example when I'm drag and dropping files into apps or folders)


[deleted]


Thanks for the suggestion! I feel like I got some productivity back after switching from Windows :)

For the unaware, I had to search safari for it, but for the others that want to try, https://rectangleapp.com/


I'm going to echo this point. Rectangle is better than the default Windows window management system imo.


Is it better than Magnet?


Rectangle and fly cut are the first two apps I download whenever I set up a new max


...and I remember that time. Holy shit, what a trip down the nostalgic lane... and it's not a pleasant one lol


For real. I have my Mac set up for pretty much identical behavior for window snapping as Windows and it feels so natural I can’t believe it’s not native


I grew up using Windows and Mac computers often (Windows at home, Macs at school and friends houses), and it's honestly always been perplexing to me that the green button enters this full screen mode. Like, why? Red and yellow correspond directly to all other major OS systems, close and minimize respectively, but green is full screen??? 
Nearly twenty-five years of using MacOS and this behavior still seems weird. Maybe not "useless" like u/Kagemand suggests, but definitely weird.


I came from Windows to Mac in 2004. That green button puzzled me at first but I like it so much more now than mindlessly maximizing windows to the full width of the display.


[deleted]


Yep it's different, and it sucks.


This sub is basically just people that are here to complain… not sure why I even bother reading it.


I've daily driven Mac OS for work and my personal computer for the last 6 years, and find it superior to windows many aspects, but even I think the way window management is handled is fucking atrocious, particularly when it comes to full screen. 


Let's say I'm in a notes app or something and I want to drag in a photo or file from finder/explorer into the app. 


Windows: my notes app is maximized. I click the windows explorer icon. It opens a small instance of explorer on top of the notes app. I drag and drop my file over to the notes app, then minimize/close explorer. 3 clicks. 

Mac: I'm using the *incredible* full screen mode. There's a few ways I could do this. 
1.	Three finger swipe over to a new desktop. Open finder. Grab the file, and awkwardly hold it near the edge of the screen so it will move back over to full screen notes. Drop the file. If I want to be neat and tidy, swipe back over, minimize/close finder, swipe back to notes. 3 clicks, 3 three-finger swipes, 1 hold and wait at the edge of the screen for 2 seconds. 
2.	Click the green button to exit full screen. Open finder. Longpress the green button on notes app to bring up the split screen menu. Click tile to the right. Click finder to tile it to the left. Drag and drop file. Close finder (which automatically puts notes back to full screen). 7 clicks. 
3.	Click green button to exit full screen. Click to open finder. Because my notes app isn't maximized/full screen any more, finder opens on top of it and completely/mostly covers it. So now make at least 2 clicks to get the windows out of each others way so I can actually drag and drop. Drag and drop the file. Close finder. Click green button to full screen the notes app again. 7 clicks at least, possibly more. 


To be fair, most of these things are fixed by just having my notes app maximized instead of full screen, *which is exactly why maximize should be the green button's default!* And at the *very* least, if apple really wants to push the full screen thing, there should be a setting that allows you to change maximize to be the default. It's ridiculous, and that's not even considering the fact that you need a third party app (or apps) just to get some reasonable window management even when you *aren’t* using full screen.


I love Dex, but wouldn’t call it “perfected” in any real way. It’s definitely more functional than Stage Manager, but it still has a ways to go.


[deleted]


That's what the current multitasking is. 2 Tiled apps with a resizable split with an optional floating window


Tiling already exists. If that’s what you want, you’ve had access to it for years and it isn’t going away with the introduction of Stage Manager


Right?! Swiping workspaces is the same power user concept as iPad OS’ dedicated-ish GUI


I really wish they'd bring back the ability to have a grid of Spaces/virtual desktops, rather than just a horizontal strip.


I’ve never gotten into using Spaces on Mac or virtual desktops on Windows. Context switch is too much. Also I forget about the apps I have on other spaces. 

Regarding Stage Manager taking up screen real estate: That was my first reaction when I saw the demo. 

But then I thought about it more and realized how much wasted space there is with most apps on a large high res external display. For example maximize your web browser window and on most sites or web apps there is a huge amount of unused white space

So when you shrink the window down tot he Stage Manager size, you really don’t lose a lot.


there's no way they will make stage manager on mac the default any time soon. it's terrible on the mac. worst of both worlds.


> I think people are really overreacting here.

Maybe... but it's absurd that years after we had an ipad with enough power to be a laptop we are still crippled by iOS. 

Years after they split the operating systems apart so ipad could have their own OS.

(almost) Years after the ipad literally has the same internal hardware as their laptops. 

People are (rightly) upset that apple seems to be keeping them seperate just to sell more.  My M1 MacBook Air is actually less useful now than it was when I bought it. When I bought it I could side load iOS apps, several of which I use for work. Apple deliberately disabled that functionality for some reason, and have made zero effort to get ios and M1/2 apps into one ecosystem. 

They are literally like a day's worth of coding away from having a ipad that can dual boot OSX and ipadOS.  They just won't do it, because it's more profitable for them to sell the devices seperately.

So I don't think it's overreacting when apple tries some half ass window manager that kinda sucks and pretends that will make the ipad functional for real work.  What it is is kinda insulting to be honest.


It is about responsiveness. They want enough RAM for each active app so that it doesn't freeze like it would on Mac OS.

The iPad and Macbooks/iMacs have two different design philosophies.


Look at 3rd party options or try the magic keyboard before buying it. It is nice and does add a good bit, but the balance is super janky and that detracts a lot IMO.


Deprecated*


Are you suggesting they’re gonna force you to run multiple overlapping apps at once?


I’d be surprised if it was TBH. After all on the Mac you can put two apps in full screen split screen or have them overlapping. The only difference might be if they decided to take away slide over which I doubt they were at that point.


It's fine to want that. But it doesn't exist yet. In the meantime, buy a laptop


Huh? 

Multitasking exists on iPads today. Touch those dots on the top, you’ll see.

Stage manager is not multitasking. It is a window manager, and it supports virtualization, which is not possible in A series chips. 

Apple really screwed up by forgetting that non-technical people pay attention to WWDC these days.


[deleted]


Yeah that is all fucking annoying. 

But those things don’t prevent a device from being used professionally


Not sure what you mean by this exactly. Changes in direction are part of honing in on the right course.


If iPads became pro tools, pros would use them as such. That doesn't mean it has to be any less capable as a consumer-level product.

For example, I am a filmmaker who uses a M1 Max to cut Arri footage. I have to lug along my MBP with me on a shoot (along with the iPad I already had with me for script, storyboard and schedule) to collect footage from my DP at the end of the day. What if I could just use the iPad for that, to save and view the footage from a drive, and even do come cutting in Final Cut or Resolve to see how things are coming together?


Then why are they selling a $1000 tablet


If they want to stop iPad revenue [from being mostly stagnant](https://images.macrumors.com/t/CfHYmGs61HgjbmEEVcHktkbx04o=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2021/07/aapl-3q21-line-chart.jpg) then they need to make it appealing to more users then those who “just” want a tablet - because they’ve already saturated that side of the market.

Pro users also tend to spend a lot more money on things, which Apple is obviously a big fan of.


I'm almost 6 years in (still using a 7 Plus and a 2017 IPP), losing imessage/facetime doesn't affect me since everybody here uses telegram/whatsapp/whatever. I almost switched to the S21 Ultra but then Samsung decided not to put in a SD Card Slot which is a huge plus for Android so i stayed a little longer with Apple. I'm just frustrated because i need mostly 2+ trys to get the airpods working, don't hear the incoming call when using airpods on the iPad only visual cue and if the phone is too far as i said can't hear it. 90% of the Time accepting a call with the iPad works don't know whats happening with the other 10% because they are not far from each other and a few other things.


I switched after 30 years. First to Windows, then to Android. Apple world just doesn't appeal me anymore. It all feels gimped.


There's at least support for it in iPadOS, if rudimentary. MacOS just doesn't support touch.


It is for me, I daily drive one and it’s really a great little tool, way comfier than lugging around a laptop plus you retain more info if you hand write vs typing your notes.


In before words like "brave", "revolutionary" and "first of its kind" are thrown about.


And touch screen


>I just don’t think it’s feasible to have a single device that does everything an iPad AND a Mac can do without alternating between both operating systems, or without having a weird mesh of macOS and iPadOS.

I think a decent proportion of people who want both iPad and Mac capabilities would be fine with running both OSes and switching between them as needed, e.g. if an external keyboard is connected.

Most of them will probably like an "iPadOS" that is identical to macOS but with SpringBoard, support for all iPhone/iPad apps\*, and probably a few other minor changes. This option would result in the same apps and interface as the current iOS-based iPadOS, as long as one keeps to iPhone and iPad apps. The advantage of a macOS-based iPadOS is that one can run Mac apps unmodified. Sure, Mac apps aren't optimized for touch, but currently they wouldn't run on the iPad *at all*. Given the choice between an app having a suboptimal experience on the iPad versus no experience, I think they'll pick the former.

\* Devs can currently choose to have their iPhone/iPad apps opt out of the Mac App Store. If iPadOS is based on macOS this option shouldn't exist (for iPadOS).


I love the 13’s boxy shape, but we should’ve gotten a ton of features YEARS ago. At this point apple just wants to say “the best XYZ we’ve developed”. I miss when Steve kept pushing the product beyond what it could do


It’s never been advertised as a Mac replacement. 

 Alternative, sure


Personally, I find a workstation inherently limited. You can't carry it and operate it like a clipboard, you can't draw or sketch on it and it's hard to do mathematical formula.

It sounds like your definition of a computer is "whatever is useful to you, specifically". That's a little self centred. What about artists, graphic designers, teachers, salespeople, airline pilots, stocktakers, contractors, doctors, nurses, editors and mathematicians? Don't they get a vote too?


Floating, resizable windows is a early 2000’s Mac feature?


HDR is for high dynamic range, usually done by having local dimming zone or individually lit led (like oled) if your display doesn’t have that, it’s probably backlight and my guess would be that it doesn’t help to have single light source for high dynamics range content, doesn’t sound very dynamic when it’s on or off.

Also personal guess but since the brightness is separate in hdr, the colors themselves are encoded differently, when you render a non hdr image, the colors have the lighting brightness in them which would make the colors darker or brighter compared to their counterpart in hdr


[deleted]


That’s actually a pretty good perspective. I’m writing this on an iPad Air 5, but right next to me is a 10th gen Core i9 PC running Windows 11, all speced out to what I use it for, very custom, everything particularly chosen. This iPad is supposed to be fast enough to compete with that PC, but there’s things I simply can’t do on the iPad, and not because of the hardware, but the lack of software support. It’s ironic that they seem to have these magnificent processors in the devices supposedly to make it a one-size-fits-all, but really it’s still just a “personal computing” device and definitely not a “pro” device.


Yeah that’s the problem


Well, not really, an iPad would also allow me to read books, draw, fill out forms… why would I need to buy two $1500+ devices with almost identical hardware, each loaded with different software so that they can function only in their own limited capacity? Apple is limiting the capabilities of the iPad Pro by design, and of course that’s their choice, it’s a formula that works well for them obviously. But they are also missing out on a market segment that’s looking for something a bit more versatile.


I want apple to turn the ipad into a surface like device.  

It'd replace all my laptops immediately


Maybe, but that is the cannibalization effect that Apple has already dismissed as not being a factor in deciding on new products. 

But also the Magic Keyboard makes the iPad more laptop-like, but it's still just a band-aid accessory, not a solution. A convertible solves Apple problem of having to make the iPad OS like a laptop because then users have have the best of both worlds.

A MacBook Air/iPad convertible would certainly have a $500+ premium over a non-convertible, so it's probably more profitable and better sales volume than the Magic Keyboard.


I don't know why people think this is a bad idea. No one is talking about shoehorning MacOS. The iPad uses the M processors now so there is no compromise in performance. The keyboard portion hold's the Mac guts just like any other Mac laptop, except for the processor. The screen has double-duty -- when it's attached to the keyboard it functions as a dumb monitor. When it's unattached it's an iPad.

As someone who travels a lot, I frequently have to choose between bringing the iPad or the MB. It would be nice to have a single device that allows me to have both without additional weigh or storage requirements. Yes, it's not for everybody, maybe even a niche product, but then again, many of Apple's products are niche or at least sold at less than mainstream volumes.


> I don't know why people keep thinking that this is a good idea. 

Because the surface line is fantastic for productivity, and iOS is not. 

Using a surface in a classroom it literally "next gen", and nothing apple has comes close to the experience.


I mean, they literally call some iPads “pro” so you can’t really use the casual user excuse.


This is correct, can confirm, i work there.

Lots of features that people don't have or complain about how they work -- is a common thing at apple. Sometimes its a good idea, other times its a shit idea. Either way -- its a loud, vocal, small percentage of dingus' that think everyone wants what they want.


i mean, i've practically run businesses off of an iphone. (art gallery, restaurant) i would really only open up my computer for photoshop, or if a website just refused to work. i used to do tip sheets every morning on an ancient ipad mini with a terrible keyboard case. it wasn't… that bad. better if i needed to pop out like a dozen emails, cause i can type faster than i can on the iphone.

most people don't really need desktop/laptop computers at all anymore. i know a lot of people whose only computer is their work-issued one…


Agreed with this. I also think iPads are frequently bought for children, who definitely would have no use in Mac OS software.


Op made a comment that multitasking only really works with a mouse and keyboard. I pointed out that's not the case. We're talking about technology, right? 

Why you so mad? Jealous type that you can't even hear the name of a brand that isn't yours? Chill bro. There's more to life.


I mean eventually a Dex style world of computing is where this is all heading.


I'll reiterate my comment from another macOS non-existent feature. "Thats fucking stupid I have to pay $10"


Or use Spectacle for free.


Unrelated but I had a similar search experience after I was put onto this new band called SALES. I really liked their song Chinese New Year. They had no publicity then so it took ages to sift through results for "Chinese New Year SALES song." I guess they, and Rectangle, attended the school of Overly Common Words used as Proper Names.


yup, glad I could help


win10 or win11? there's been a few nice changes in the latest win11 builds and it's even better with fancyzones.


They are the same.


Marketing hasn’t had enough time to come up with a catchy name for it so Apple can introduce it as a revolutionary leap forward for computing.


can you show how you set up the snapping like windows, that sounds awesome


It even used to be “maximize window” until they replaced it with full screen which sucks because it will make a virtual desktop of the app and cram it at the end of your virtual desktops.


Why is that useless? It’s the same as windows.


Sounds like user error.


Windows users who don't know anything about Mac OSX


How so?


Is Dex even usable with touch input?


Good thing apple has keyboard and touch pad support


so make it a proper tiling wm instead of this half-assed split+floating.


It's very limited, and doesn't give you a fraction of the features of stage manager that Apple thinks is so important. No virtual desktops, limited in the number of apps open both on screen and in the background

Why can't Apple provide this with stage manager?


But if you use Mission Control you can easily check on all your spaces and have basically the same view as stage manager. With the only thing difference that you need to enter the space fullscreen to do something in it.


Describing “I can’t 100% overlap my windows” as “crippled” is exactly the kind of overreaction I’m talking about.


I forgot to mention that I picked up the iPad Pro + magic keyboard combo last Friday from the apple store to try at work (they said I can return the whole thing if things don’t work out for a refund). 
I tried iPadOS16 beta bits way too unstable for work so I went back to 15. 
The only way to make it work I found was to use GoodNotes for everything (typing+Apple Pencil use) which is fine. I’m gonna give it a proper try this week and if it doesn’t work then I’ll just return it. 
I’m curious though, what did you mean by 3rd party options? Did you mean apps?


I mean it wouldn’t surprise me if the old multitasking user interface is end of lifed after all of Apple’s current iPads have M series chips.


I mean, it's not that big of a muscle-memory change to move your finger ever so slightly further away from the edge of the screen. There are plenty of issues with iPadOS but you're reaching (no pun intended) for an issue here.

I get your point, but it's just a reality that a portable tablet will not fulfil the same usecases as a dedicated pro workstation / laptop. They're both meant to be used in different scenarios (the tablet in the field like in your example would be great for quickly reviewing footage for example, so the apps for that solve a different need than if you're editing it on your home workstation).


The airpod thingie gets on my nerves as well.


What phone computer did you move too? I feel like the m chips from apple has changed the game in terms of efficiency and power for laptops.


What do you think alternative implies?


Work on Stage Manager began back in 2006: https://techreflect.net/2022/06/rising-from-the-ashes-stage-manager/


Totally follow you. I understand the concept of HDR, I shoot on cameras with 13-16 stops of DR and I understand what “real” HDR looks like thanks to my HDR TV and displays like the iPhone. 

But then we have these shitty HDR implementations that make no sense. I have a BenQ monitor that is rated for HDR and is advertised for HDR but to be honest I have yet to see anything “HDR” about it. When I enable HDR in my Mac’s settings, the colors are completely ass.

yes, and that's exactly why it is setup like it is. right now they got you spending $1500+ on the Mac, another $1500 on the iPad Pro, and so on. it's a money thing like everything else. while we would all love a single device that 100% did everything...it ain't gonna happen.


You, my friend, are but a very small part of a group that wants these things. The rest of the world uses a laptop to do actual work. For everything else, there are other solutions. Like an iPad(mini). 

Both have their specific use cases. Just because on paper, the iPad could theoretically run Mac OS, doesn't mean they should as that would hinder their user experience. It's not only because they want more money(they do) but the way it is now, they just haven't figured out how to make a profitable machine that does everything and work seamlessly


Considering it’s been a decade now and they haven’t means I’m probably gonna just give up all hope entirely of this ever happening.


Why? There’s a surface product already.


They wouldn’t come out and openly admit if cannibalization was a factor, though. That wouldn’t benefit them. And clearly they haven’t actually followed through yet, despite making promises about a pro iPad experience every year since the iPad Pro was launched.


A lot of Surface fans out there but also a lot of people who find the OS experience to be quite clunky and that's considering how long they've been working on a hybrid solution. And Microsoft ≠ Apple. iOS not being fantastic for productivity isn't a good excuse for Apple to try and integrate touch into MacOS. The ones who want this think that it's a simple solution that would work fine, which couldn't be further from the truth. They don't realize all of the numerous elements that would not only need to work but work well. Apple hasn't gone and aren't going to go this route because they know it doesn't make any sense and that it wouldn't actually add any value. It would do the opposite. It's like wanting flying cars. Sure, it sounds great but it makes more sense to improve ground infrastructure and public transportation.


But a) they make up a relatively small percentage of ipad sales and b) even of those people using them, a smaller number is actually doing anything “pro” on there. Don’t get me wrong, i think ipad with m1 should do more, i just don’t think slapping mac os on it is the answer. I think stage manager is a step towards mac os and ipad os being closer but like always with apple, it won’t happen overnight. Maybe it should happen quicker. Even xcode and fcp on ipad would signal their intent a bit


Hey, I’m a load vocal dingus. Can we have a first party version of yabai/skhd on macOS? I don’t wanna (and don’t know that I can) disable rootless on a corp device, but I’ve gotten used to the workflow that i3 allows on Linux and I really wish I could have that on Mac.


Your point is absolutely valid.  

The other person makes it seem like Apple doesn’t do it because it is impossible to make finger controls work.

You poonted out, Samsung has made it work, so Apple can too if they wanted to.

He - wrongly- objects to Relevancy.


Yeah I agree. My point is more about the form factor of devices and all of them having different purposes. But I agree dev type things will be future of computing.


The solution to lots of UI issues on macOS seems to be third party software.

Dang, lol. I can imagine the sheer frustration and mad laughs, trying to look that up via any modern search engine, especially without the band being famous or known in any measurable (on a scale of the world wide web) capacity :P


Great band


i have not updated to win11 yet cuz im lazy. but that's interesting; i didnt know they updated window management. That's something to look forward to Lol


Rectangle is free and gives me more options for padding around windows and customizing hot keys than magnet. Rectangle can almost make macOS look like a tiling window manager (except you’re doing the tiling manually).


Jokes aside, I thought the real reason behind why macOS lacks window snapping is because of patents? I am told that’s also why Windows’ virtual desktops work so awkwardly/differently to macOS’ Spaces (especially how app windows behave between those desktops).

I am fairly sure I read somewhere that Apple can’t just copy/paste that feature in as-is without trigger problems from Microsoft’s legal team. Microsoft doesn’t go after small third-party devs offering the same feature because it’s not worth the team/effort.


Option green gives you maximize

Because fullscreen isn't what anyone wants, ever. And no one wants to combine a keyboard shortcut with a mouse button for a task they do all day, every day.

I want a window to fill the screen, and still see my taskbar.


Seems like it as well as a bunch of android users lol.


Yes.


One UI already has free form multi-window support without Dex. That works perfectly fine with touch input. Dex is really the desktop experience, meant to be used with KB+M.


[deleted]


Stage manager is just as limited in terms of number of apps. That’s an overarching OS thing. Yes, you can have more apps on screen running in “normal” (I.e. not slide over) mode with stage manager, but that, in my opinion, is because the displays that are targeted are so small that the UX just isn’t good if you dice that up into 4 pieces. 4 apps works in stage manager because they’re overlapping and still of good, usable size even when there’s 4 of them. I don’t see them ever providing the ability to divide the display into 4 pieces for that reason.

Not sure exactly what you mean by “virtual desktops” in the concepts of snapped apps, but you can have as many snapped app groups as you want and can switch between them just as if they were a single app, which is close enough to virtual desktops for me and really just exactly what the “virtual desktops” in stage manager are as well.


There are a couple other brands that make keyboards. I haven’t tried any of them, and the apple one does some nice stuff, but it doesn’t have the polish their other hardware does. You can’t really control the angle and the iPad Pro is a lot heavier than the keyboard so it doesn’t sit well.

https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro Here’s an example. I haven’t had my hands on it, so don’t know if it resolves anything. My complaints just weren’t things I was aware were going to be issues when I bought it.


Will it surprise you when they dont?

What a stupid take


[deleted]


Oh, I slightly misread your comment. Yes it does seem like with the intro of iPadOS there is an intent to go this way.


When Apple starts selling larger iPad sizes than 12.9 inches, which they’re apparently working on, I don’t see what would make them an unappealing alternative to a MacBook Pro for many professionals, if the software reached a threshold of sophistication.


I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Love it. Backup Galaxy Note 10 and for podcasts and music on wifi I have a Motorola One 5G. I have several laptops: Dell G5 SE for gaming. Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1. Dell 3120 2-in-1. Asus 17.3" Chromebook. Acer 2-in-1 11.6" Chromebook.


That it can be used instead of. 

Which it can

They are literally both computers. 

Both can run software. 

You know the difference between alternative and replacement?


As someone who has the iPad Pro m1, likes it a lot, and uses it every day I would say that having a luxury sedan that can’t carry more than a small suitcase because the trunk is deliberately welded shut is very disappointing.


What a ridiculous analogy. Apple has been trying to push the narrative for the better part of a decade now that an iPad is a laptop replacement. Need I bring up the “what’s a computer?” ad? Apple released a Land Rover that can’t accommodate a trailer hitch and can’t go off road. A total waste of the hardware’s potential.


Yes- such a device would certainly canabalize their own sales, so it’d for sure be less profitable. I’m not sure how small the fraction is of people who want more out of their iPads, but reading reviews, it’s quite a common complaint that the device is too limited to warrant the price tag. If you buy the cheapest $300 iPad, sure, you get what you pay for, but $1500??

If they really wanted to tho, I have no doubt they could make such a device. If they would make a device that behaves practically like an iMac when plugged in to a screen/keyboard/mouse, and don’t change anything when it’s not, they’d have a pretty good POC.


not a mac os one


Why is it so hard to accept that there are people who generally like Apple products for their quality and aesthetics, but dislike certain choices that they make in terms of versatility (and repairability I might add).


[deleted]


This is the ravings of fools. 

Apple and Microsoft both have an enormous amount of patents on various elements of computing and mobile devices. Hardware and software. 

There’s cross licensing deals in place between lots of companies to deal with this. You use mine and I’ll use yours. The belief that window snapping is special enough to prevent an agreement like this is foolish.

You also can’t patent a feature as I understand it, you patent how you achieved that feature. So the whole thing doesn’t hold water. Add in the fact that there are third party applications providing these features on Mac. The explanation for that here is “they’re too small to sue” makes it seem like Microsoft doesn’t have an entire law team on retainer explicitly to go after people who violate their patents. 

Apple doesn’t see this feature as a priority or they are doing exactly what I implied. Delaying a great feature so they have another thing to talk about for release 1X X years from now. 

Just think about the fact the iPhone couldn’t dismiss phone calls without sending to voicemail until the last big update. Was that a patent issue for 10 years?


Good to know. It's pretty undiscoverable though.


Oh do you mean the snapping to half the screen? Yeah I’d love that. I hate their snapping implementation on MacOS because it’s just scaled-up iPad. I was talking about using the green button to fully expand the window the max size across the screen.


Microsoft has a patent on it, which is why it's not built into macOS. Apple's a big enough target for Microsoft to sue, the rest (Rectangle, Magnets, etc) are hopefully small enough to fly under the radar.


Yes that’s what I mean by full screen if you hold command


I've said it before in another thread, but the real "pro" Apple users don't even come here to complain these things because they have other things to worry about. Like actual performance of a device.

I've never ever heard someone doing real work complain about their Macbook in terms of usability. Because it does everything they need. "Pro" people that use iPads don't either because they know what they're using it for.

A lot of people on here buy things they don't need and then complain that it doesnt do that niche thing they want to do. It's mind boggling

If you really wanted to multitask on an iPad, you can do that. You don't need free-form windows resizing nor Stage Manager.


With usable I mean usable in a nice way.


Dex also works fine with your fingers.

The size of the input has no bearing on the concept. Borders and hit zones can simply be enlarged.


At a certain point, you are the issue, not the world around you


Old man yells at clouds.


Ironically the hardware might be the limiting factor (relative to previous generations of iPad and iOS/iPadOS) this time. [According to Ross Young](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/apple-ipad-future-product-updates/) last week: 

>Among the key new details is the fact that Young no longer believes that the 14.1-inch iPad rumored to launch early next year will feature mini-LED technology, with the display effectively being the same LCD that is in the current iPad Air.

So the rumored 14" iPad would have a worse display than the 14" and 16" MacBook Pros. 

Maybe that's the reason why the 13" MBP is still around, so people can "upgrade" from it to the 14" iPad next year without going backwards on display quality. ^(/s)


So I can use my IPad as an alternative to replace a Mac right?

Just like it's advertised only they force it too use a different OS despite the fact the CPU are nearly identical now.


>That it can be used instead of.  
>  
>Which it can  
>  
>They are literally both computers.  
>  
>Both can run software.

Then this definition of "alternative" is not useful; any computer from the Apple Watch to the Mac Pro is an alternative for any other computer.

It seems that the iPad is so much less capable than the Mac (overall) that a definition of "Mac alternative" that includes the iPad ends up being broad enough to encompass all computers.


It’s not that the trunk is welded shut, it’s that Apple refused to sell a sedan the back of a pickup welded to it.

An iPhone 13 is 1200 bucks. A Sony A7iii is around 3000 bucks. The latter only shoots pictures and videos.

At the same time, the iPhone can't do the same things the Macbook does. Far from it.

Pricing is relative. An iPad Pro is only 1500 when you want it to be. But just because it doesn't do certain features the same, doesn't mean the price is unjustified. 

They give you options. It's on you to identify your options and find a solution that best suit your needs with the available hardware.


Not needed.


>	Why is it so hard to accept that there are people who generally like Apple products for their quality and aesthetics

The surface is not even a good product to begin with. It’s a half-assed tablet and a half-assed computer that is not good at being either of both


>	Almost everyone in my med school uses surfaces.

I know a lot of educators and people that work at different companies that were assigned surfaces and they absolute can't stand using it. So it being technically better than an iPad, since you're comparing a desktop OS against a tablet OS, doesn't mean it's universally loved. 

I don't know how old you are but Microsoft has been working on touch for a long time, before they even considered integrating it into Windows. As soon as they started, though, they quickly realized it was going to be a lot harder than they initially thought. Go back and look at the UX design of Windows 7 and then run through the different releases over the years to see how they kept trying to figure out the touch/mouse experience. And they're *still* making changes today as you can see with Windows 11. That tells you that they're still trying to sort it out. 

>	but how often are you having to adjust settings, and when you actually need to how often do you not have the keyboard/mouse handy?

No company should ever design anything that's supposed to be quality product with the excuse of, "but how often do you really need to do this thing or that thing that's not as intuitive or easy with this other method we implemented and that you have to use if you don't have the hardware that makes it easier?" It's lazy and nonsensical. 

Apple failing to make meaningful improvements to iPadOS is not a good enough reason to make some type of MacOS on iPad disaster of a decision. And luckily, when it comes to that, it's clear (they've said as much numerous times already) that they're not interested in the slightest. It's not gonna happen and for good reason.


You’re equating one thing with something completely different. And this is true about MS having the trade dress patents for Aero Snap. Apple and Microsoft have a far deeper licensing deal than most will ever know about, including the secret billion dollar deal for Apple to not sue Microsoft for stealing QuickTime tech. 

But Aero Snap is a well-known MS trade dress patent and Apple is making many different ways around it. It’s not ravings of fools. 

If you want to learn more, there’s a huge expose on the infamous Microsoft / Apple “$150 million investment” deal 

http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/592FE887-5CA1-4F30-BD62-407362B533B9.html

that lays out the case that Microsoft actually paid out $500 million to $2 Billion to Apple for the rest of the patents Apple was able to sue for. The deal made Microsoft look like the good guys for “saving Apple,” with a paltry $150 million, but their balance books over those years magically has an extra $2 billion that materialized from somewhere.


Gotcha. Appreciate the insight into this, as I’m genuinely not aware of what the actual reason for missing/delayed features is at both Apple and Microsoft.

I guess, then, my only question is why some features come so much later to each respective platform, yet get implemented in a crappier way. Surely they could’ve just copied the way the feature works to the end user?


I mean yeah, the pros and cons of the whole apple philosophy is simplifying the ui for 80% of the use cases, but tons of secret handshake power features.

For example, command space is how I access almost every app or file


Most Linux DEs have that functionality.


If I hold command and press the green one (tried just now), it goes fullscreen, not maximized.


Here's a video I made elsewhere for another user.

And this is very much that point!


>	So I can use my IPad as an alternative to replace a Mac right?

How on earth am I supposed to know the answer to that?

It depends entirely on what you use a computer for.


You are aware that everyone’s needs from a computer are different right?


For a great many people *any* ipad is a suitable *alternative* to a Mac. 

Sorry if that upsets you

It seems obvious enough to me that apples goal for the iPad to make it a good *alternative* to for people who want a simpler or more portable personal computer. 

And would you really want it another way. If they were designing it to be a replacement for the Mac that would mean a very different set of goals. 

personally I don’t want apple designing anything to replace the Mac


So you’re using a Steve Jobs quote from when? 10/12 years ago? If you wanna use that analogy you have to accept that many trucks in 2022 can carry cargo as well as drive in luxury, fairly easily. Therefore, iPads of 2022 should also do both—at least to an extent. And that’s based off yours and Steve’s analogy. 
Steve Jobs was a revolutionary thinker. He would have updated and tweaked his thought process over the years, just like the engineers who design vehicles have been able to make upgrades and bring some “best of both worlds” options to them in the recent and coming years.


I’m extending the analogy by saying that a luxury sedan that has the capability of carrying much more cargo but is deliberately prevented by the manufacturer from doing so is disappointing.

It seems like you’re trying to make Mac and iPad abilities mutually exclusive when there could be much more overlap.


The iPad Pro is sold as a “desktop replacement”, while the iPhone isn’t.

Although I must say I would love it if also my iPhone would plugin to a screen and act as a portable workstation (it’s a lot more powerful than a raspberry pi for instance), I understand this is way too niche to be profitable.


Maybe not for you. But everyone has their use cases. 

You know what’s not needed though? An iPad that’s as powerful as their laptop line. But can’t even use half the processing power due to the limitations of being app only.


> I know a lot of educators and people that work at different companies that were assigned surfaces and they absolute can't stand using it. So it being technically better than an iPad, since you're comparing a desktop OS against a tablet OS, doesn't mean it's universally loved.

I'm not in love with the front door on my house, but it does the job.

Yes, the surface Pro is technically better at doing real work, including schoolwork than the iPad Pro.  And that "technically" is completely irrelevant because it is better at doing it. I would love it if an iPad was actually functional. The sad reality is it is not. 

>And they're still making changes today as you can see with Windows 11. That tells you that they're still trying to sort it out.

Okay.  But they are making a product that people use.  That is better than anything else on the market. 

>No company should ever design anything that's supposed to be quality product with the excuse of, "but how often do you really need to do this thing or that thing that's not as intuitive or easy

Are you kidding?  That is the definition of Apple / iOS. 

Try to download a PDF from an email, edit it, save it locally, then send it to someone.  It's a fucking nightmare on iOS.


> Apple failing to make meaningful improvements to iPadOS is not a good enough reason to make some type of MacOS on iPad disaster of a decision.

And.. to be clear... you think it would be a disaster because.... you think that some of the menus are too small to touch. 

This is like them saying they just can't release a weather app for ipad because it wasn't good enough, and when they finally did after a decade it was just the same weather app. 


lol.

>It's not gonna happen and for good reason.

Again, the entire surface line, the line that forced apple to try and copy the apple pencil after, disagrees.


Launchers like spotlight, raycast, or Alfred are just a way better method of navigation than using a dock.


In addition to secret power user shortcuts why can't there just be a fucking setting that changes whether the green button is maximize or full screen


Like this. Excuse the sideways-ness, it's 4am and I can't be arsed to go back and rotate it.

https://i.imgur.com/ycaOE4v.mp4


Thanks for not arguing the actual point and moving the goal post.


Yeah that looks pretty useful. Wouldn’t mind if they implemented that in iPads at all


Whatever bro, iPad has never been advertised as a full replacement for the Mac

And it’s literally always, since the first generation been a viable option as an alternative.


Firefox with actual ublock origin support would be amazing. Please.


Maybe because EU is pushing for sideloading and alt stores?


Good, it's a stupid requirement.


What alternate timeline are we in?


Feel bad for the developers of Orion, their unique standalone feature was supporting FireFox and also Chromium extensions in WebKit.


This is the one that matters most, IMO.  A lot more than offering alternative stores and sideloading.


Finally, FF can have Gecko as it should.


Shout out to the EU for doing what our paid off politicians refuse to do in the US.


Please! This is one of the biggest things i miss from my android days.


I hope they do because all iOS browsers are another version of Safari.


I'll say the one upside to this requirement I feel has been the holding back Blink from completely dominating the market, as we absolutely need healthy competition. That said I can't say the ends justify the means and especially having Gecko on iOS would be nice.


What’s next, letting us rearrange the icons on the home screen however we want?


I would have once cheered for this; but if you think it through, it's going to expand and cement the sad dominance of Chrome. Safari is really the only thing staving it off.

Welcome back to "This site works best with..." bullshit.


Choice is good, but I am sure this will lead to a further monopoly of Chrome/Chromium, which at the end will be bad for everyone (when Google will push more bullshit into Chrome like breaking adblocks).


Apple finally realized the fines were going to be too much of the continue to resist eu not mention being straight up not able to sell iphones. EU means business from all the headlines


Am I the only one who thinks safari is great on the iPhone and iPad? It’s my favorite by a mile. I use chrome on my P.C.


Now let's get USB C/USB 3 speeds


I miss real mobile firefox from android.


Although I support this. I am afraid web developers will drop WebKit support and push Blink/Chromium even more.


Likely because EU wants them to or will force them to


I’d be so flippin happy to have *real* Firefox on my phone. Especially if it means add-ons!


while i use chrome daily on my other devices (Android, MacOS, Windows) i would still use Safari for iOS.

Webkit on iPhone is just so smooth and reliable for me.

Edit: i am not even disagreeing with the headline yet the downvotes, sometimes this sub is so


RIP every browser other than Chrome. 

Devs already don’t bother making sites work with safari or Firefox, we’re in for Google’s IE6 forever now.

Buuulshiiit no way they're doing this voluntarily.


Good. I don't see how anyone could argue about this being bad, yet people are


It will be really nice if we can have the choice of browsers, as opposed to what we have now, which is basically a different skin on top of Safari.

Anecdote: A website I use on a daily basis for work was updated a few months ago, and this ended up breaking it in Safari. Basically, it was impossible to login. On my desktop, I could obviously switch to a myriad of other browsers, but that wasn't possible on iOS/iPadOS, as every other browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) all exhibited the same issue because of it's reliance on WebKit. 

While I was able to implement a workaround (using a Safari Extension that fixed the glitch), that was a lot more complex than the average iPhone/iPad user is going to be able to do, as it required writing some custom javascript code. Think about how many times a website has some issue with some browser and the solution, or at least step #1 in troubleshooting, is "try another browser". Apple makes that impossible in their mobile OS's. 

While I understand there are some concerns with loosening the reins here causing some issues, I think those could be mitigated by still requiring embedded browsers in unrelated apps to still use WebKit, but allow exemptions from apps specifically built as web browsers. Give people the option of what they want to use.


Are we actually winning? Between this and 3rd Party app store(which I want but I know would probably not end up using a whole lot anyway), we are getting huge changes.

Damn didn’t know EU was the hero we needed


The fact that this requirement existed to begin with, is mind-blowing to me

All this news about apple opening up iOS today. I literally cannot believe it. Would love it though.


Shit man this would be awesome.


Cool, now chromium can complete its domination and hold a monopoly on the web 👍


Finally. Excellent news.


Well praise the Lord.


Yesterday I read the rumor of allowing alternate stores and I say "If apple goes thru with this, move to USB-C  AND allow other browser engines, I would consider getting my first iphone ever".

And here we are, so let me start saving pennies for my first ever iPhone.


Does this mean we'll finally get proper webM support! since Apple wants to sit on their ass w/ Safari.


Are we gonna get individual articles for each requirement of the Digital Markets App?

Next is gonna be "Apple to allow changing default voice assistant".


If Apple does this, Safari is on its way the same as the old Edge


Greaaaat [let’s make everything Chrome](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/5b/21/a95b21796d8c2edd6d6d707692a01b87.jpg) (sigh…)


Holy shit, this is great news. Specially since I am more of a user of Firefox because of Linux.


I for one can’t wait for all the lazy web developers to just start throwing up “works best with Chrome” banners instead of taking an extra few minutes to support Safari.

The web on the desktop is bad enough and the saving grace of mobile was that stuff just worked and I didn’t have to eventually install a Chromium based browser to get a site to render properly because some lazy didn’t bother to add support for Gecko or WebKit.


I’ll still keep using Safari.


Being able to use Chromium on an IPad would be great.  It has Web Serial API features which Apple will never approve for Safari


Pls pls pls do this. I’m sick of having to use two apps just to have subpar ad blocking


Rule #1 of Apple: don’t believe rumors.

Rule #2 of Apple: first learn rule #1.


Apple has been uncharacteristically pro consumer recently between this and the rumor that they’re gonna allow sideloading. At this rate tomorrow they’ll announce T9 dialing and I’m here for it


So does that mean web Bluetooth???


Do it. Webkit sux


I think this would be a horrible idea, the main reason they did this was for optimisation (power consumption) and also privacy (when they refused to implement a dozen JavaScript APIs because fingerprinting) 

I really hate the whole idea of 3rd party app stores on iOS it’s going to make the platform less secure and allow companies a way of dodging privacy features and core iOS functionality (windowing, slide over, basic iOS SDK support)

I think both of these changes will honestly harm iOS massively.


I would never use a Apple Device ever, just because its basically a prison where they tell you what you are allowed to do with your overpriced phone.


Apple considering allowing real alternative browsers AND (possibly) alternative AppStores (in Europe, maybe). What happened?

Anyway, a good day for Apple users and their freedom to choose the programs they want!


Good. It’s a weird hill to die on.


FINALLY!!!


YES PLEASE


That should also enable proper mouse and keyboard support for GeforceNow in the browser, right?


I've left reddit because of the API changes.


Now Apple, please make the physical dual SIM support available in SEA and India.


About time.


This…would…..be……AWESOME!!!!!


Wooo yeah baby, that what I've been waiting for.

This could be especially nice for older devices giving them an actual up to date browser.


Oh thank God, fuck Safari's WebKit. 

I've had one too many issues using many sites with buttons straight up not working, and being locked into one scrolling direction when scrolling annoys me to no end, especially when I often use Desktop sites on mobile, I like the full circular scrolling I can do on browsers on Android, rather than needing to take my finger off the display to switch to scroll horizonally, or vertically.


uBlock Origin is possible with Orion Browser on iOS.


This. It’s the biggest thing missing from the iPhone and main thing keeping me from buying an iPad. (For my use cases, ymmv).


Why is this better than Safari with AdGuard?

Genuine question. I don't know the difference, but AdGuard works fine for me on iOS.


Firefox is dying though 🙁

Edit: To the downvoters. Why? I'm a Firefox user, but that doesn't discount that it has been in a very serious decline in user-base and market-share for more than a decade that has put it in a precarious arrangement with its mission and financials.


Regulatory pressure works


Exactly because of this.


Thanks to the EU for actually trying to do some consumer protection in tech. Seems like the US has mostly given up.


Exactly. Aint got nothing to do with Apple really wanting to. They are being forced to.


Right...can't believe people are looking over the obvious


Apple “considering” dropping WebKit requirement.

Apple “considering” allowing alternative stores…

Apple isn’t “considering” anything unless they’re talking about allowing it worldwide


Probably!

Glad to be European and pushing for bastards to be nice!


They probably don't want Google to be actively encouraging iPhone users to figure out how to sideload a real version of Chrome.


Yeah, I feel like I'm an apple apologist for most of their strange decisions, but this one feels unnecessary.  If it's an app that fulfills all the other requirements then let it in the store.  What are they afraid of?


The main reason they tried it is because JIT compilation is required for any fast JavaScript performance, however, JIT also enables running code that could extremely easily break out of the app sandbox, whether that be because the website you’re visiting has a zero-day exploit for Chromium/V8, or because the app developer themselves uses JIT to break out of the sandbox and do something like pull PII from other apps using an iOS sandbox escape zero-day.

Currently, this is all protected by the fact that JIT is disabled for apps submitted to the App Store, so the attack Surface is extremely small and Apple’s binary analysis tools can examine every part of the app. 

So they either allow JIT and open users up to exploits that break out of the app sandbox, or disable JIT and these alternate browsers will be handicapped by having to use a slow JavaScript interpreter.


Stupid? Absolutely. A necessary evil to prevent Google from completely controlling the internet? Also yes.

I don't know why people are celebrating the Chromium engine potentially getting to dominate yet another platform. For the sake of web freedom we should be advocating for the exact opposite to happen.

Edit: In an ideal world Gecko, Webkit, and Chromium would have an equal 33% split between the three of them

The convenience iOS security has provided has been nice.  Beyond a few very targeted attacks iOS has been nearly immune for over a decade from malware.  

We’ve just been laughing when android users get 0wned.

But that’s going to end now. One way or another.


It's what funds Safari development and testing.  So I am for them keeping it.  I prefer Safari over Chrome.

Where are all the anti-socialists now.


Getting sherlocked by legal compliance


It's still a really good browser, and I'd continue to use it even if this were to happen.


I think it depends if Apple allows Chrome/Firefox to use JIT compilation, which is still an unknown as currently iOS apps other than Safari aren't allowed to do so. If they now allow JIT compilation, it's actually a significant policy change, but if they don't, then Chrome and Firefox will be much slower than WebKit on a lot of modern websites.


That's still their thing, at least on macOS where Safari/WebKit is far more efficient than anything else


Is it Orion by Kagi?

It was kind of an artificial problem to begin with no thanks to Apple. Like I appreciate the effort but this wouldn’t have been a solution that needed to be made in the first place


Does Orion support custom extensions on iOS? Can we upload a file?


I tried to like Orion, but it was so buggy for me on my Mac that I had to give it up — I never realized how much I took Chrome's stability for granted



I'm gay btw


[deleted]


You're not wrong, this is something that directly affects day to day usage on a phone/tablet more so than rare cases of needing to sideload something.

Not an Apple fan at all but I'm glad they're slowly adapting a more open mindset on these things.


Alt stores can also provide this benefit so no, just this one doesn't matter the most.


Why?

And you realize that, in the end, this will most likely reduce browser variety and lead to more regression toward "This site works best with..."

The demise of Safari will mean everyone will be subject to the whims of Google, via Chrome.


EU politicians are still pretty corrupt and take a lot of bribes (“lobbying”).

Right now WebKit is inferior. Hopefully some competition spurs Apple to actually compete. I don't like the idea of the internet being dominated by any one engine, but it's a very good engine.


> like breaking adblocks

Currently there are NO AD BLOCKS except on Safari because of Apple's policies. Different engines means I can start having an ad blocker on other browsers.


No, Safari is perfectly fine, and we can continue to use it.

Choice is better though


no one says it's worse. people are happy about getting more options


You should try Aloha Browser then for sometime.


“This site works best with X” should be illegal for the top browsers. In the UK public sector, it’s a regulatory requirement to support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari — which covers the 3 main rendering engines.


Why is that a bad thing? Let users decide.


>Webkit on iPhone is just so smooth and reliable for me.

But we have nothing to compare it against. Not saying it's bad, but we don't know how much better it could be. Competition from Google and Mozilla will be a huge win for users


>Webkit on iPhone is just so smooth and reliable for me

Wha... There are not even alternatives yet for the comparison


FireFox > Chrome

That might be the reason for disagreements.


My main gripe is that "request desktop website" on iOS never works like it does on Android. Some websites have awful mobile websites that like features on the desktop version and this just never works on iOS no matter what I try.


>Webkit on iPhone is just so smooth and reliable for me.

Than...use it???


>Devs already don’t bother making sites work with safari or Firefox

As a developer I am confused where you get this from. My company forced us to support fucking Internet Explorer even though it was deprecated for a year. Also there is nothing special about sites, a div tag is a div tag, there is no special browser specific things to do. Except for Internet Explorer, because it did not implement more modern things we had to do weird things.

The only way a site will not work on Safari is if Safari does not implement standard functions, which is Apple's fault not the site developers fault.


I really doubt it will make much difference, being the default on a device is a barrier to switching.   For example Samsung Internet browser has traction in any survey tracking mobile browser use just because it's the default on Samsung Android devices.

A bigger possible change might be if EU makes Apple make a browser ballot on device setup which they already have on Android devices.


[deleted]


Especially since Firefox now has the very real possibility of being allowed to use the Gecko engine iOS.


this is awful news for the web. Everything is going chrome now.


At the moment all "web browser" apps on iOS are just rebadged Safari. They can't change how the actual web page rendering happens, because Apple forces them to use WebKit (the core of Safari) to do that.

If this changes, you could get the "real" version of Chrome/Firefox/Brave/etc. with the same features as the desktop version.


The thing is that basically any browser uses the same webpage rendering engine- safari WebKit

So any browser you use on iOS devices is essentially the same as safari at the core, but just wrapped in a different skin (chrome, Firefox, whatever). Besides some possible optimizations, they’re the same performance level, similar engine bugs, etc 

Dropping this requirement would mean other apps can use their own engine, increasing competition and potentially meaning better performance and features to the end user down the line.


No difference for a non technical end user other than arguably more accessible extensions. Huge difference for technical users and developers.


If you use a non-Safari browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.) they'll be able to support features beyond what Safari does. Stuff like progressive web apps (PWAs).


If this goes through, you will have "real" Chrome and Firefox and massively better web surfing experience.


Virtually nothing.


Very little 

Currently, making certain websites work in safari may require some extra work from developers, depending on what features they use. Some features are entirely missing in safari or are more complicated.

Developers often put in this work, because there’s enough people using safari to justify it - or if they have a dedicated app they might just push people to that instead.

If other browsers become available on iOS, and you’re using safari, you might see certain websites telling you to just download a different browser (usually chrome) to view their website, that way they don’t need to put in the extra work to get it working on safari.

For more advanced users, the option to use other browsers would allow for things like extensions and adblockers, which are currently severely limited in safari as it doesn’t support all the features required. This is the part that most people here are excited for

iOS does have other browsers right now, but these are actually just skins for safari. It’s still safari, just with a custom UI. The topic here allows for actual other browsers instead of just skins.


They aren't. They're doing it because they're being forced to. But same result either way.


There's a sizable contingent on this sub that get very mad at anything that might threaten Apple's profits. That's what it boils down to.


I still remember trying to help someone narrow down an issue. They used a set of “browsers” on their iPhone and Safari on their MacBook, and concluded that since the issues was consistent across them that it was the website, when no one else reported that issue. It literally took months of helping them on and off to get them to try a different web browser on their MacBook before they could get the website to work, never did get them to clear their cache.


How? PWAs will still require OS support that apple doesn’t have to (and likely won’t) add. 

How does a different browser engine enable PWAs?


But Apple is already reversing its current stance and will allow side loading and other app stores on iOS.


This is a pretty significant change.


Not *necessarily*.

Right now, most of the world uses Chromium and the only other browser that has a relevant marketshare is Safari because it's the only browser on a large share of devices. I'm a Firefox user myself, but our market share is what, 5%?

Now with a bunch of people on iOS probably switching to Chrome, there's really no reason for anyone to explicitly support browsers that aren't Chrome. Any time Google decides to do something that isn't in accordance with W3 standards, web devs can go straight to using that because their whole userbase, save maybe a total 10% of Firefox and Safari users at that point, is on Chromium.


I'm a web dev who can't test in Safari because I own no (current) Apple devices.


Safari and chrome should adopt a standard. It’s 2022, there is no excuse for something to work on chrome but not safari.


As should be your choice! That's what makes this great!


How?! What have you been watching or listening? these changes have only come about due to eu regulations literally dragging them kicking and screaming. I swear people see Apple though some very thick rose tinted glasses


Don’t forget iCloud e2ee.


And this is why people should be thanking the EU. It's because of the EU that Apple's considering any of these changes.


I mean yes, but a lot of this is being forced by EU laws.


I think they are just trying to preempt the EU anti competitive stuff. Which is good. That is exactly how it should happen.

I've started to go all-in on Orion on the desktop (even if it still has some small rendering bugs), but I couldn't get used to the interface on the iPhone. Somehow it bugged me that it's somewhat like Safari but certain things are different, like the tabs button not being in the bottom right.


Been trying it out since I saw this yesterday, it's great!


AdGuard>Ublock and is OS wide


Exactly the same for me, too. It might even entice me to make my next phone an iPhone, too. Maybe.


Mostly so that I can sync my 10+ years of saved bookmarks, history, etc, with my non-apple devices that I have!


Because I cannot use Safari on my Windows Desktop and my Windows machine at work. But Firefox, yes. I hate how if I want to sync my web history across all devices I need to settle for no Adblock on iPhone…

>	What are they afraid of? 

Competition.


Browsers need Just In Time Compilation. Apple has restricted that to just themselves since forever and would need to open it up for other web engines to exist. With JIT, you can also run unsigned code, which is a big no-no to Apple.


The same thing MS was afraid of when they tried to make the web proprietary with Internet Explorer etc. If everything you do is done through a portal in a web-browser, why would you need Windows? The truth is you don't and this is exceedingly true, even in the enterprise with Google Workspace now. They don't want the App Store on iOS to become like the Mac App Store on MacOS. Something that few support because it's not required and the 'default' way of downloading and installing apps is sitll to go to the app website/github etc. and devs don't have to give 30% of their cuts to Apple etc.

As a consumer this has pluses and minuses. Obviously less choice and competition is one of them as is well documented. However with the app store I know that apps can't do annoying things like popup windows that ask to rate the app in the app store. Things like that are often outright not allowed and I LIKE THAT! A new one is apps are starting to ask for always on location for extra rewards like the Dunkin' app when you buy coffee etc. Apple could ban that practice with a flick of a switch. You can't do that with a decentralized system. That has incredible value for me as a consumer and until there are laws and regulations protecting digital privacy that the types of exploitations like the Dunkin' app try to pull over on people, I don't want the iOS experience to be compromised by those annoyances. 

I also don't want to have several different app stores installed like on my PC with all the gaming storefronts. Right now I have to manage Steam, Battle.net, Epic, Ubisoft UPlay, EA Origin, GoG Galaxy, & Xbox/MS Store just to manage my PC games. I don't want to have to do that on my phone. No thank you.


Competition is what they’re afraid of. Namely Apple doesn’t want web apps to get good to the point that it could suck money away from App Store sales. One way to achieve that is to always keep mobile Safari just sucky enough that it prevents that while still being decent enough so customers don’t complain.


My guess is security. 

A lot of jailbreaks for consoles or even iOS involve the web browser.


Competition and loosing control over which web standards get adopted


[deleted]


fellow apple apologist here lol

honestly, non-webkit browsers have a lot more access (in theory complete access) to what you’re browsing, and collect whatever data they want from you.

as a web dev, webkit is pretty good, but not perfect. however, i can see companies like meta and tiktok having their own in-app browsers not based on webkit that just collect a ridiculous amount of data on you, whereas it’s much more difficult using apple’s in-app browser support.

not to mention the security risks of JIT/other technologies that break out of the sandbox. honestly seems like a huge security risk with not a ton of gain to the end user imo.

regulatory pressure is great for things like enforcing USB-C, but it’s kind of awful to force apple to introduce security risks on their operating system


You are right, though I don’t see why would JITted code be any more dangerous than AOT-compiled. There is no reason why a “normal” app can’t just use a zero-day to break out from the same sandbox for the exact same results.


This is just an excuse though—jit is literally a setting you can flip on or off in the advanced config section, Apple could just say to Chrome/Firefox “you can be on our store, but you have to turn the jit off by default.”


Yes, forcing Webkit is on iOS devices is not ideal, but it's also the only thing stopping Google gaining an Internet Explorer style monopoly over the web.

Microsoft have abandoned their own web engine, and Firefox continues to circle the drain due to Mozilla's ineptitude. Keeping Webkit in the game, by any means, is all that stops Google controlling the web.


Why does everyone here have a hate boner for anything google produces. Just let people use what the fuck they want. If it's better people will use it. You're basically just saying that safari is shit and it's good that people are forced to use it.

(im a firefox user btw)


Then maybe Apple should make that browser actually useful?


>	I don’t know why people are celebrating the Chromium engine potentially getting to dominate yet another platform. For the sake of web freedom we should be advocating for the exact opposite to happen.

Idk, the current state of fragmentation seems to be doing more harm than good as we try to keep things standardized. Example: new CSS feature dropped? Hooray, now we (devs) wait years for it to get enough adoption to actually use it. 

Chromium is usually decently fast with feature adoption, Gecko takes ages for things they deem unimportant but at least the updates trickle down to older platforms, WebKit is sometimes way ahead of the curve but is often coupled with the OS which means legacy platforms need support for painfully long. 

As long as the popular option is actually open source I don’t see it imposing on anyone’s freedoms.


Google’s control of the browser would be fragile. They’re not even the default browser on any major desktop platform! They have to stay on top by making a better browser.

Meanwhile Apple can simply drag its feet implementing support for new features in Safari and very effectively keep the web platform from competing with apps (which they make money on). And iOS users have no recourse.


>  A necessary evil to prevent Google from completely controlling the internet? Also yes.

Lmao, imagine claiming to care about competition while actively campaigning to ban competition. 

News flash. There've been multiple browsers since before iOS existed. If Apple wants people to use theirs, maybe they can actually make it worth using?


You have some fundamental misconceptions about iOS security. There have been numerous major breaches in the past decade.


the owning already occurs.   [https://www.macworld.com/article/1435224/16-1-2-update-zero-day-vulnerability-webkit.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/1435224/16-1-2-update-zero-day-vulnerability-webkit.html) In a twist it was Google who pointed this out and not for the first time.

Really some “rules for thee but not for me” there. No wonder they’re drawing so much regulatory ire.


Yup, that’s the one - they also have a website.


Yes. Did you make one?


AppStore is pretty much fine.


It will need to expand other features than just relying on extensions support.


That is a good point but not ideal.   You really just want Apple to do what Google does with Android in terms of browsers.

Allow the user to use whatever browser they want and let them install it from the Apple App store.


They are not choosing to do this.  They are being forced to do this.

Google has allowed other browsers on Android since day 1.   Same with sideloading and other app stores.


>


Today it is a security issue. When there is zero days found in Webkit there is no way for the user to avoid.


No, ending Apple's. You're free to keep using Safari if you want.


If something is free, it's the best option available, and people choose to use it willingly, it's not a monopoly. Maybe if apple improved WebKit and made it open to other platforms it might be used more. Until then, I will always prefer Chrome or Firefox

That's fine if you want to have a subpar experience, but most of us don't


Ok? Thanks for letting us know?


This is the mail in the coffin for anything that’s non-blink including Firefox/Gecko.

With this, there’s no reason for larger websites to avoid just telling people to switch to Chrome.  Much cheaper than supporting multiple browsers.

Apple was keeping Firefox alive since you already needed to support WebKit. Supporting Gecko isn’t much extra.

But now you can reduce to one engine.

Not sure this is the clear-cut win for users that it initially seems. While I’m certainly not a fan of the current situation, the desktop landscape is essentially dominated by Chromium-derived browsers. Mozilla (my choice) simply hasn’t been able to compete effectively. 

If iOS follows a similar trend of Chromium-domination, the overall quality of the web experience gets worse in the long-run


> Competition from Google and Mozilla will be a huge win for users

There's no competition in the browser space on desktop irrespective of what you've come to believe. There's just chrome (and it's derivatives) and insignificant *others*. That's it. 

The only thing keeping Chrome from absolute domination was ironically Apple's stupid (?) move of keeping iOS browsers locked down to Webkit which gave Safari a healthy market share to challenge stupid shit that Google tried to push through as standards (look at WebP)


I use chrome/Vivaldi browser on my Redmi note 11. The amount of Ads and app directs i get are much much more than i get on Safari. Even with popup blockers installed. (using the same site of course)

I cannot list out every item but everything adds up to great experience. Even from simple ones such as the intuitive gestures on Safari.


That's probably because websites use browser detection to force you into a mobile site anyway.  I see that on iPad quite a bit where a "mobile-like" page pulls up or the "your in mobile use our app" still shows up.


I remember “best viewed in ie” banners or warnings about missing activeX plugins from ie. that includes every government website and back in the day. 

I see no reason we don’t end up back there because someone can say “works on chrome” and shrug off proper accessibility to a banner. 

Right now you can’t do that because is not accessible on a large portion of devices people use. 

I’m also not looking forward to every Google search or map out YouTube video not supporting safari the way Google chose to drop edge on windows phone.


So Safari is so terrible that everyone will flee to Chrome at the first opportunity? Sounds like nothing of value was lost then.

PWAs will require additional iOS support that apple isn’t likely to add. Can you explain how just a difference in browser engine is going to enable that when the rest of the platform support isn’t there?

That would go against the advertising narrative that most people eat up like candy.

Remember kids, USB-C is the future and good enough for MacBooks and iPads yet simultaneously bad for iPhone because reasons!


Webkit updates stopping after os updates stop, and it being the only way to browse the web was certainly part of apple's planned obsolescence, so it's a win either way.


Orion looks amazing, but none of the extensions i tried (unlock, dark reader...) worked.

It has potential, and i love what the dev is doing but it isn't as fluent as safari, sharing the same design though.

Sadly stuff like keyboard shortcuts and the like aren't as well thought out rn.

I can't wait until it gets out of beta though :3


It supports all FireFox extensions surprisingly well.


Yeah


I think Apple will choose AppStore over Browser now.


Check the settings in the latest version if you discover anything new, how’s your experience so far on desktop version?


I am using AdGuard but still get tons of ads.  I must be doing something wrong.


Mozilla is on life support and very very badly needs help. I'm saying this as someone who loves FF


Developing a browser that can compete with Microsoft and Google is very expensive, and Mozilla for various reasons including losing users and being unwilling/unable to monetize them as successfully as Microsoft and Google can just doesn't have the resources. Following the same trend we've seen 1000 times before in tech, the advantages of scale are just huge.


It may not ever totally die, but it might just reach the point where it is financially destabilized enough to become a clunky browser that is a shell of its former self. I say this as someone who is a user and hoping for its success.

You just aren't brave enough to truly appreciate Apple's genius.


Yeah I know. I’m just saying this likely only happened because the EU actually pursues this stuff and Apple isn’t likely to make separate versions of iOS for EU vs rest of the world. We all benefit from such a massive market giving a shit about consumer protection in tech.


Not exactly competition but AppStore aka web apps. 

Speaking of competition, Chromium is just a monopoly out there and this doesn’t help.


Web apps, the easy way around the App Store.  We don’t need apps, all of these can run in the browser with a better WebKit.  Apple was pushing them when iOS first came out and then silently killed the web App Store.


On contrary, chromium dominance need apple engine as competition.


There’s a reason Safari is always the slowest to adopt feature for progressive web apps (other than their once-a-year update cycle).


I would also argue they’re afraid of unleashing the tracking abilities other browser engines may open for the platform. That’s at least something the general public should be concerned about.


Or, taking them at their word - they are worried about security on a device that was designed to be an appliance. A third party engine running arbitrary code loaded from the internet *could* be problematic


Browsers don't "need" JIT, you can do decently fine with just an Interpreter


#I no longer allow Reddit to profit from my content - Mass exodus 2023 -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/


which jailbreaks use the ios web browser? The only one i can think of is totallynotspyware, which only supports iOS 10.


This is the correct answer, browsers have an absolutely massive attack surface, and also need to perform some very risky operations which can and have lead to full exploitation. Needing to use a just in time (JIT) compiler to execute JavaScript efficiently means that the browser needs to allocate memory which is essentially indirectly writable by an attacker, that is also executable by the cpu - a recipe for remote code execution vulnerabilities… because JavaScript is literally remote code execution from untrusted sources. The use of garbage collection can also introduce other memory corruption bugs if done improperly; use after free attacks, buffer overflows etc. are all possible.

Basically browsers are a security nightmare, and Apple have put a lot of effort into making WebKit secure, and they probably dread the thought of being able to allow others the same low level access needed to pull of the same performance and security. 

The major browser vendors also have incredibly good security teams and practices, but that doesn’t mean they are perfectly secure, and Apple have always had a strong stance on protecting their users; at least they can own up to exploits in WebKit and get them fixed quickly, they can’t force others to do the same.


Other browsers would have less access to the system than safari.


[deleted]


[deleted]


It’s not. Apple doesn’t like JITs because it allows apps to change behavior after going through review. This is already possible with embedded runtimes so the point is moot but they cling to this for whatever reason.


Because with JITs you have to allow code in memory to be mutable. With AOT you can scan the code and at runtime the code can’t be changed.


I think it may be an excuse, but at least following the  logic, users using Chrome and Firefox will end up having a subpar experience and probably will think "iPhones are slow" rather than "Chrome is slow" since they may not be switching back-and-forth between Safari and Chrome.


If Safari is so terrible that no one will use it unless forced, then the worst case scenario has already occurred. 

Or maybe Apple could actually invest in their browser and make it *desirable* to use?


So, because apple can’t compete, they force your users to use your shitty WebKit? 

Maybe if they made safari better, people won’t use chrome?


Chromium just killed JPEG-XL for example and that seems mostly because Google has a case of “not made here” syndrome. That is kind of a problem. Open source means nothing if the guys that run it do whatever the fuck they want anyway and control the market.


[deleted]


Sure, Chromium is "free and open source" by the letter of the law. However, have you ever seen any project contributors outright reject changes made by Google? So far not one of the major Chromium contributors has rejected Manifest v3, nor promised support for JPEG-XL when Google has not.

You do realize how isolated that is.  It was discovered as part of a highly targeted attack (read: likely a government entity involved).

Android users are dealing with malware apps on a regular basis.


Free markets need regulations. 

In unregulated markets, competition eventually dies off as big players threaten, bribe, buy up, or otherwise eliminate smaller competitors from the market until only one or only a handful of big players exist.

Having a market where a multitude of competitors exists and where participants have to innovate rapidly in order to be competitive is beneficial for everyone.

And don't let the Austrian school "economists" tell you otherwise, because they're wrong. Their utopian "free" market where no government exist is a fantasy, and their ideas are just a repackaging of edgy, Ayn Rand type high school libertarianism with fancier words.

Yes, now there are actually options on iOS. If people choose Chromium, that's their prerogative.

Good. It was a flawed format and not even production ready yet.

> There’s no stopping it. Google can snuff out every whiff of competition on the web, and all the technology that it runs on, all while portraying themselves as an open source loving corporation.

They also killed their own WebP format ... What's your rebuttal here? Both file formats were flawed and need to be relooked at.

I use FireFox so I don't know what you're going on about.


Also every single law passed by the EU effects Google in an equally massive way. Especially related to their messenger protocols.


I'll check it out. I like Orion for the privacy features. Is Aloha similar?


Yup, of course it is JIT'ed. Interpreted JS is pretty slow.

It also used to be the case that you couldn't use the JIT compiler if you embed a web view in your app until they introduced a newer API called WKWebView which runs the embedded web browser in a separate process.


It’s not just a senseless “rules for thee and not for me” approach or an arbitrary rule they’re doing “just because they can”. 

No apps on iOS are allowed to use JIT because it’s a security risk - basically allowing the generation and execution of arbitrary native code. Right now, apple has it down pretty good that the only *native* code that can run on the platform is code that has been signed and analyzed by apple. They have some fairly sophisticated binary static analysis tools to detect developers doing nasty things. Of course, those aren’t perfect, but they’re better than nothing. All of that is completely bypassed with JIT, fundamentally weakening the security model on iOS.


No. Just wondering if I can use extensions that are on GitHub only


Do we need to pay for Orion?


I know they're being forced to do some of these things stemming from outside the States, but they have shown an odd willingness to change their ways in some aspects that wasn't the case before.

If Chromium is allowed on iOS, the lazy-ass web devs who hate using technology older than last week will make all of their websites require it, *forcing* me and others who despise Google and Chromium to adopt it as well. The same way they update sites on the desktop web while changing absolutely zero user-facing functionality, causing them to break in Safari when they worked the day before. And frequently, when that happens, they won’t work in Firefox either. I have all three browsers installed on my Mac, but I only open chrome as an absolute last resort. It is in fact possible to make a performant, modern website that runs in all browsers, you just have to give up whatever bleeding edge features google forced into chromium in the last few updates.


I'm letting EU know, you living in US are just powerless corporate slave


> With this, there’s no reason for larger websites to avoid just telling people to switch to Chrome

People don't switch browsers on a whim. There's stickiness.


> Much cheaper than supporting multiple browsers.

Supporting multiple browsers is easy when they actually follow standards. It's Safari that usually fails to do so these days. It's the new IE, in many ways.

Multiple browsers have existed since long before iOS did.


Honestly, I feel like this is fine, so long as we both have the option to use other engines, and Blink remains open source and free to use. 

Between that, Webkit, and Gecko, we really don't *need* a million browser render engines if they all fundamentally do the same thing and aren't fundamentally different from one another. Three is good, and as long as Google continues bankrolling Mozilla as a get-out-of-anti-trust card, two will remain.


That doesn't mean the same applies to iOS. 

Besides, Chrome scores better in terms of speed compared to Safari. 

https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/07/chrome-faster-safari-speedometer-benchmark/

Safari is definitely more efficient in terms of battery, but that's also partially attributed to the very limited add-ons functionality compared to other browsers.


That's also partially because Apple gives Safari deeper OS integrations that others can't have. It is another way Apple is artificially holding other browsers back.


You're right, Apple holding back the web is much better for consumers.

> In almost every area, Apple's low-quality implementation of features WebKit already supports requires workarounds. Developers would not need to find and fix these issues in Firefox (Gecko) or Chrome/Edge/Brave/Samsung Internet (Blink). This adds to the expense of developing for iOS.

Use FireFox and add uBlock Origin extension or try Aloha Browser.


Which is why "request desktop site" should also spoof the user agent to appear as a desktop user.


Google actually supports (and actively drives) open standards. IE's biggest issue was proprietary everything.


nothing to do with it being terrible, just cutting development costs. if you can target 100% of users by supporting a single engine, that’s what you’re going to do.

Chrome currently has 65% market share, edge (which is chromium based) has 4% and Opera (which is now also chromium) has 2% - so that’s about 71% chromium, while safari has about 19%.

Do you genuinely think chromium having an even larger market share is good? it’s not like it’s an objectively better browser. All this is going to do is give Google nearly unilateral control over web browsers.

I just feel like the benefits of letting other web engines on iOS are outweighed by the problem of a chrome monopoly.


Do you fucking work for Google or are you just a fanboy?

This is a huge loss for browser diversity because 99% of the people choosing their browser don’t make conscious decision. Their choice was an illusion. In reality they pick the one with most accessible to them or the one that advertising has told them to use. That’s it. And all of those people don’t care what browser engine is working behind the scenes.

All they care about is they their tabs sync, the colors are pretty, and the features are there. None of that requires a different engine. 99% of people don’t care because ***they already have Firefox and Chrome on iOS***.

We devs had a great understanding — write your websites in such a way that they conform to the broad set of features shared by all browsers. And now that’s gone and replaced by the Blink, puppeted by Google.

You're perfectly free to keep using Safari if you want. You just can't force others to do so.


> Remember kids, USB-C is the future and good enough for MacBooks and iPads yet simultaneously bad for iPhone because reasons!

Am I the only one who remember the uproar and outrage when Apple dropped the 30-pin connector for the Lightning connector?  How angry so many people were when all of their docks and cables and speakers and other accessories (many of which had been around since the introduction of the iPod in 2001) suddenly become e-waste?

I can understand Apple's reluctance, even if I'd much rather have a USB-C iPhone myself.  But there are roughly eleventy-bazillion Lightning cables and accessories out there in this world that are perfectly functional, but which will become obsolete e-waste once Apple switches, and they know they're going to take it on the nose.  The only thing that will soften the blow will be that they can point to legislation and say "Hey, they're _making_ us do this!".

TBH, IMO the best thing for Apple to do (from a consumer perspective) would be to offer both Lightening and USB-C based iPhones for each model for two generations, and give people time to migrate.  That would complicate things for Apple somewhat on the manufacturing side however, so I doubt they'd ever do this -- but they're going to get less backlash if there is an overlapping migration strategy in place, and they'll make people like you and I happy by making USB-C iPhones a reality (I _love_ USB-C on my iPad Pro, and use it every day for everything from networking to video out to using USB thumb drives to plugging in gaming controllers, never mind having a great selection of devices I can charge and charge from).


Is there a way to get it to sync bookmarks/history with Firefox on desktop?


Last time I tried it React Developer Tools didn’t seem to work (either the Chrome or Firefox version) which made it a non-starter for some work I do.  It’s pretty impressive what it does manage to support but it’s not flawless.


Ublock menu doesnt show up properly…same with bypass firewall


That’s likely the case. You can also add custom block lists. Here is a list of well known lists (see below). You’ll need to get the RAW text link and add it under DNS filtering > DNS Protection > DNS filtering > DNS Filters

Make sure you also go to Protection > Safari Protection > Filters and enable the filters listed there. This is also another place you can add custom lists. 

It’s not the most intuitive to set up but once done correctly, you’ll hardly ever see ads. I’d have any questions feel free to ask.

Correct


Are web apps different than PWAs? GeForce Now and xCloud work well with PWA right now.


Chromium isn’t a problem. It’s open source and others can branch off it and change whatever code necessary. 

The open source World is actually kind of weird. Companies like Google and FB put out really good open source stuff, trusted by the entire industry.


Probably not just the fear of competition, but also the instability that comes with alt-stores and an open software ecosystem.  

This will mean more malware and buggier experiences generally, but the questions is if all that is worth it.  Personally, I think so.


Chromium may be a monopoly but it has all the features people are looking for. Webkit is perpetually years behind on adding api support. If webkit were a competent competitor this wouldn’t be an issue


Safari is literally the only reason Google doesn’t de facto control the W3, Chromium browsers make up about 82% of desktop traffic and 70% of mobile traffic


Because web apps suck compared to apps developed with native technologies and designed with native UI paradigms in mind. Just look at how macOS is infested with terrible Electron apps.


Web apps suck compared to native apps. I’ve been a mobile developer since saving web apps to the Home Screen was the only option. The performance and flexibility just isn’t the same.


I’m curious about the hate for safari other than extensions, closed source and exclusivity, and by extension WebKit. Could someone kindly explain it to me?

WebKit is typically the slowest of the three major browser engines to fix security bugs

Yeah, I know. But even fucking Powerpoint is Turing complete, so there really is not much point. iSH is a full blown x86 emulator and is available. It is just prevented from being faster.


I don’t know about the internals of ios, but this is not really how it’s done on other OSs. This is called the W^X problem (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX ), and you basically write your compiled code to a memory page, and set it later to executable, while disabling further writes.

Also, as many things it can be easily circumvented by increasing abstraction. Like, just write an interpreter and then you can just change your to be executed program’s byte code on the fly during execution.


Anecdote warning, but I had macs and Android phones for years, and then when I got rid of my Android phone for an iPhone, I ditched Chrome so hard and never looked back. The smoothness and lack of revving up my MacBook fans and hours of extra battery made it easy. Safari is certainly desireable to use for me at least. I don’t know why I would go back to Chrome unless I had a Windows PC or Android phone.


I willingly use Safari. I like it.¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯


Normal people don’t give a fuck what engine powers their browser. They see an icon, a familiar UI, familiar features, and that’s how their choice is made. To 99.9% of the world, **they already have Firefox and Chrome on iOS**.


Android comes pre-installed with Chrome neither Microsoft had a browser traditionally for users of Windows.


There’s not a “market” of browser engines. Nobody is making money based on which browser *engine* people use. They’re all free to the user, and the data collection and stuff you could monetize doesn’t depend on the engine. So it doesn’t really make sense to talk about competition in a market sense in this area. 

This whole thing is a complete non issue. What part of the user experience of using the chrome or Firefox apps on iOS is degraded because the engine is different? All the engine does is render webpages. Nothing more. Changing it will just mean…the webpages are rendered in 99% the same way as before. It’s not like any new capabilities like PWAs are going to be enabled because that requires additional OS support that Apple’s not going to add. So why are people so incredibly invested in different rendering engines that will make almost 0 impact on their browsing experience?


No one else seems to really care. *You* probably never heard of JPEG-XL before, but since Google thinks it should be deprecated, I'm sure you're now an expert.

Sounds like someone gets their "knowledge" of Android from /r/apple.


That is ridiculous.  I personally carry a Pixel 6 Pro and an iPhone and never had a single problem with malware with either phone.

But on the Pixel I get to use whatever browser I want and that is not true wwith my iPhone.

But the bigger issue is the security problem on my iPhone.  When there are zero days found in Safari (WebKit) I can't avoid.  Where if that happens on my Pixel I can.


Lmao, what? It's Safari that consistently has more compatibility issues than any other browser. This is because Apple is *years* behind in feature support, and generally underinvests in Safari's maintenance. 

And nope, Firefox is pretty close to Chrome's level of compatibility. And it *just so happens* they're also much closer to Chrome in feature support. 

https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/

If you want to use Safari despite all this, no one's going to stop you, but you can hardly complain if other people don't want to be arbitrarily held back.


I'm from EU too you m8, your comment was simply out of place. This thread is about the iOS and not "which OS do you prefer".


They do when websites simply put a error telling you to switch browsers.  It's worked in the past.


The only “standards” safari doesn’t follow are the ones that Google has nearly unilaterally come up with that fix problems that Google has with the other standards. There’s been limited collaboration and input from other companies - Google basically comes up with something, calls it a standard, and then asks “why aren’t all the other browsers supporting this?”. 

Tons of their standards are for stuff that doesn’t belong in a web browser anyway - turning the browser into basically its own OS but a whole lot shittier. 

Safari supports all the standards reasonably necessary to render modern webpages and web apps that should actually be web apps. And grudgingly supports a good bit of the other junk as well.


Gecko and WebKit are dead when this happens.

A lot of engineering effort can be cut by telling customers to just use Chrome.

WebKit is what’s been holding this back. Now you can cut down to one.

I can’t see many companies not taking the savings here.

Firefox only lives on if it adopts Blink as it’s rendering engine.

Pushing for new standards like “web speech recognition” is just Embrace Extend Extinguish under a new guise. 

Nobody could feasibly make a new from scratch browser anymore, and that’s a huge problem for the browser ecosystem.


> nothing to do with it being terrible, just cutting development costs. if you can target 100% of users by supporting a single engine, that’s what you’re going to do.

But people aren't going to switch browsers just to use a random website. So this scenario is only possible if everyone abandons Safari, which itself would only happen if Safari is particularly terrible. 

Also, on a more practical note, supporting multiple web browsers isn't that hard. If anything, Safari is far more difficult than it needs to be directly because Apple deliberately keeps it stunted. 

> All this is going to do is give Google nearly unilateral control over web browsers.

Chromium is not Chrome. Chromium is open source, so in addition to active contributions by companies like Microsoft, if anyone is annoyed with the direction it's taking, they could freely fork it. 

> Do you genuinely think chromium having an even larger market share is good?

Having competition in the market is absolutely good. If Chromium gaining share is a threat to Apple, then this means they actually need to invest in Safari to make it a desirable alternative. That's how Chrome became popular in the first place.


>if you can target 100% of users by supporting a single engine,

That is not how web development works. You don't target browsers, you just write CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Each browser handles them roughly the same way. There is nothing special.

For sites to ONLY work on Chrome than the developers will have to spend extra time and effect making that happen. Why would they?

Though the only other scenario is Apple refusing to implement some standard JavaScript functions, for whatever reason, so if a site uses those functions than it breaks on Safari. But that is Apple's fault for being lazy. And the amount of sites that use super specific ultra modern APIs that might not be implemented yet on Safari are like 0.001% of all sites.


> In reality they pick the one with most accessible to them or the one that advertising has told them to use.

In that case, it would be Safari, as it's been the default on iOS so long. 

> We devs had a great understanding — write your websites in such a way that they conform to the broad set of features shared by all browsers. 

And they still do. But Apple has been deliberately crippling Safari to hold back web progress, as they see a capable web browser as a threat to the app store. So it's *Safari* that needs special handling, not Chrome. 

Again, the only way people would abandon Safari is if the alternatives are that much better. Just as people abandoned IE for Chrome. In which case, Apple has no one to blame but themselves. 

Tell me, are you made that Chrome killed IE as well? Do you long for the days of IE6?


>We devs had a great understanding — write your websites in such a way that they conform to the broad set of features shared by all browsers. And now that’s gone and replaced by the Blink, puppeted by Google.

Actually its Apple who is bad here. They specifically cripple WebKit so that developers are forced to use native apps instead of making a purely web based app because they get their 30% cut on native apps and not on web apps.

And users have no choice in web engines because Apple forces everyone to use their crippled web engine.

Yet despite this, Apple made the change and it was a near universal improvement. Same as when they lead the charge to ditch serial ports, for USB, and ditched floppy drives for CDs. Apple is no stranger to changing things to make a better product, it's only recently that they've gotten so stubborn about things like this.

It's a significant factor for why I ended up on Android for phones.  Still Mac on the desktop, but the iOS/iPhone platform restrictions vs. benefits tipped in Android's favor 3 years ago and it's only moved further in that direction since then.

*Real* Firefox with extensions on iOS would start tipping things back, though.  Enough that I might finally get a modern iPad, at least.

"It's open source" doesn't mean much when Google is in charge of the project. What they want dictates Chromium, not the community. As a whole, companies have been abusing open source to dictate technological norms under the guise of altruism


except that google basically dictates what the future of web is going to be like. take the new extentions limitations. google is basically killing most ad blockers because their Floc plan failed


In the same spirit and logic, WebKit is actually open source as well.


This isn't a computer though.  The OS is still going to be their only giving rights that the app asks for and the user gives, being sand-boxed and all the other stuff iOS does.


And then you’ve FireFox 🔥


Electron apps are a plague


And yet plenty of those Mac apps wouldn't exist at all without modern web technologies. And they can be performant too, like VS Code.


yeah, I think the reason it sucks is because only webkit and that's what this is about


Apple purposely cripples the adaptation of web standards to keep progressive web apps crippled. It is because modern progressive web apps on a browser with full standard implementation can basically replicate 99% of the functionality of native apps. Thus it would hurt Apple's strangle hold on having apps only through their App Store.


Well it would not be great for power efficiency thats for sure.


Firefox user since version 1.5 if not 1.0 here.

No, I've never had those issues, minus some REALLY old websites that required Microsoft Silverlight or ActiveX. Online banking has always worked (for my Estonian banks anyway). Hell, banks for the most part even supported IE until recently at least, if not still. Netflix and Prime Video both work flawlessly (Okay Prime has crap UI, but that's on them).

Teams or Zoom meeting? Idk, first time you just have to allow it to launch the Teams or Zoom application and second time it's automatic if you checked that. I've also used Teams and Google Meet in-browser without issues, Zoom has been in dedicated client mostly because I used it at least 3-4x a week so I preferred having a dedicated client.

New Reddit? Well it's shit anyway, I avoid it like the plague and have since release. But I don't recall it having issues loading. If it did, that would've been the reddit devs' fault, considering Firefox follows web standards and Chrome is the one that occasionally tries to bend them, much like IE back in the day when it had dominance.

Technically Firefox IS a bit slower than Chrome according to Browserbench, but then again you might want to use Safari if speed is all you care about, it blew them both out of the water when I first tested on my M1 at least.

But exploiting an app like this (where you don't have the ability to generate new executable code) is much harder. There are known techniques like [return to libc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-to-libc_attack) but they are more involved and harder to set up compared to just being able to generate whatever executable code you can. If the app's executable parts are fixed, there is a limited amount of attack vectors for the attacker to use.


If you allow JITs in 3rd party apps that’s useless because the app decides what to write to the code page before setting XO. Once there you can’t enforce security policies that rely on AOT code scanning.

Right now even if you write a byte code interpreter, the interpreter itself has to be compiled with the tool chain of Apple and then scanned before they accept it.


iOS goes beyond W\^X; effectively a page that has *ever* been writable can never be made executable (nor can you map in something new as read-only but with dynamic content)


Firefox on macOS absolutely dunks on safari feature wise, doesn't use Chromium, is open source and has never spun up my fans either. Unless you really care about safari's design language, there's little reason to use it over FF and other open browsers. It and similar projects are absolutely held back on iOS though by the webkit requirement.


And if people like you willingly choose it, then Chromium won't gain a monopoly.


And the chrome they have will be significantly better than what it is currently. So I don’t see what the issue is


You do know how shitty and archaic WebKit is right? Or are you just talking about something you know nothing about. 

Also there is literally a market for browsers. The engines are an aspect that could greatly improve user experience. If they are not restricted to WebKit, they can actually improve their browsers to be better than safari which means more users which means more revenue.


I have actually used it quite extensively, it's a pretty darn awesome format. A go read that chromium issue, the way the communication went was also classic Google. Not really a good way to go about it while a bunch of other large corporations try to convince them to not drop support this early.

Yes, having choices is indeed counter to monopolies. Glad you're coming around.


Kind of like right-click but with haptic-touch instead, even the media player is good like a standalone app not requiring a separate VLC player for example.


It’s just some amazing extension I use to bypass paywalls on certain sites on my Mac and was hoping I would be able to add it to Orion. I’ve tried to add it but unfortunately it doesn’t seem to work


[deleted]


Part of the reason Mozilla has so much trouble is that they have to constantly work around the clock to keep up with Google’s stupid additions. And yes, Safari is behind, but it’s behind in things that don’t actually matter to the web. Nothing that Chrome has, that Safari doesn’t, is in any way necessary to run a website. It’s just new versions of things that were arbitrarily changed in order to force everyone to use Blink/Chromium.

And again, the point that dozens of people have pointed out to you throughout this thread, that you continue to ignore and refuse to address, is that if developers do not support older standards, without forcing completely unnecessary new changes, then I cannot use whatever browser I want, and I will be forced to use Google’s. Currently, I can use Safari on Mac, because enough websites work because of the developers supporting iOS. That will not be the case in the future. I have definitely, multiple times, had the experience that a website that was working one day in Safari will suddenly stop working, but when I open it in Firefox, or if that doesn’t work, in Chrome, the website looks and functions exactly the same way as it did the day before. Sure, occasionally a refactor could be necessary for security, but that’s definitely a minority of cases where this happens.


Plenty of people will just leave the website. That only works if you're like Netflix levels of importance.


And yet Firefox, independent of Google, has implemented far more than Safari. It's *only* Safari that lags behind, and it's *Safari* that suffers the vast majority of compatibility issues. 

https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/


WebKit says no to a lot of really shady features that everyone else says yes to. We should be lucky to have an engine being developed that ACTUALLY takes consumer safety seriously.


What's the actual loss here, though? Is there something about Blink that's harming the web space as of right now?

I just struggle to see what is actually being lost here other than a nebulous idea that having one render engine is bad just because.


[Here's a very in-depth battery comparison](https://singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-video-power-consumption-pt-1/#power-consumption-measurement). Notably:

>Chrome’s power consumption is higher than Safari’s while both are decoding hardware decoding of VP9 codec

And the reason:

>chrome likely isn’t using the OS low power video pipeline for security or lack of access. 

>For example, Chrome doesn’t have access to Safari / Mac OS EME pipeline because different DRM systems.


> Pushing for new standards like “web speech recognition” is just Embrace Extend Extinguish under a new guise.

What? Literally the only way that feature would have an impact is if devs actively want to use it. And again, it's not proprietary. You can even use the code written by Google engineers. 

> Nobody could feasibly make a new from scratch browser anymore, and that’s a huge problem for the browser ecosystem.

Chromium is open source. You could fork it and create your own browser anytime.


Most websites won't use those chromium features though? They would only need basic web viewing experience.


> And they still do.

Hm I wonder why.

> are you made that Chrome killed IE as well? Do you long for the days of IE6?

You should be mad that Microsoft abandoned IE because of Blink's market dominance. Having 1 major player in an industry is never, ever healthy. Note: markets are larger than 1 platform (i.e. iOS).


While annoying to some at the time, I feel those situations were different because:

0. They affected a much smaller, and much more technical group of people.  Apple didn't even break 10% of the PC market when any of these occurred anywhere in the world.  They've sold many times more iPhone/iPad/iPod devices with Lightning connectors than they ever did Macs back in the 90s, and
1. You could pretty easily work around any of these changes.  If you needed a serial port, there were relatively inexpensive USB to Serial adaptors available.  If you still needed a floppy, it wasn't a big challenge buying a USB floppy drive (and you still can today if you really want to), which goes hand-in-hand with...
2. Other than being a connector, Lightning is also often used as a physical mounting point, preventing any sort of adapter from being usable.  Anything with a dock can't really be readily "adapted" for USB-C use from a Lightening connector, so vehicles with car mounts with Lightning connectors (as is still needed for CarPlay in many models of vehicle) don't have an easy solution to just adapting to USB-C.  Neither do clock radios and speakers and other devices that use the Lightning connector as a physical mounting connector.  That wasn't an issue for serial port devices in the 90s, and wouldn't apply to different disc drives.

I stayed in a 4-star hotel last month where all of the rooms had a clock radio with a Lightning dock, both for charging and for outputting music.  A switch to USB-C makes these perfectly working devices, which were likely at least $25 - $30 each (assuming the hotel chain gets a bulk purchasing discount off retail) in 1300 rooms -- that's around $45k in clock radios for just _one_ hotel in a global chain that would become useless if iPhones moved to USB-C.

That wasn't anywhere near the case when Apple dropped all of their proprietary connectors along with parallel and serial ports to move to USB.  The scale of the change and who it impacts are drastically different -- there is a difference in an order of magnitude, and it will affect devices people (many of whom aren't technically inclined) aren't used to replacing every few years.

When the change is made, the headlines will be _extremely_ unkind.  Apple is no longer "Apple Computer" with devices aimed at techies and creatives alone.  They make general consumer electronics now, and the iPhone is their cash cow.  I can't blame them for being reticent making this change.


China: Quick let’s build them another White House.


I can’t use Safari on Windows. That alone makes me want proper Firefox with proper extension support on iOS.


I hadn't used Safari in many years but with Google's latest decisions I decided to ditch them and moved to Firefox on Windows and was going to use Firefox on Mac but gave Safari a trial and it really surprised me. I wish the extension support was better but otherwise it's been great and I'll likely continue to use it. Not sure why Safari gets shunned by Chrome for so many Mac users, maybe because it's just what they are used to doing with Windows? Shrug.


I use Firefox over Safari on my 2018 Mac Mini. When I use Safari it’s pretty snappy, but it’s also not loaded up with all my bookmarks and customizations and whatnots so I dunno. Firefox is plenty optimized.


Safari on the MacBook runs great, yes. However, you have the choice to use it or whatever else you want. Choice is good, even if you ultimately choose the default option.


how is it proved if no other web engines are even allowed?


Yes and it’s not even close


Yea it is. Also way more efficient with memory. Chrome eats your memory like crazy.


uBlock origin for me


I've left reddit because of the API changes.


Orion kind of gives me sketch vibes right now. 

I'll probably feel better about it if they ever open source it though.


All about the developer. The Corsair iCue desktop software is heinous lol


[deleted]


Yet people don’t choose it for browsers for various reasons. 

Open source software dominating its space is… not a bad thing at all. People make the Chromium situation out to be worse than it is.

It’s in no way a monopoly, it’s a free resource with free competitors. This would be like saying “Wikipedia is a monopoly.” So what? They’re free, their competition is free, everyone uses them because it’s the best experience. There’s no downsides.


It is a computer, despite what the little girl in that commercial told you.  

Apps are sandboxed, but you never really know what you'll get once you open a platform up.  In Apple's case, it's mostly going to be the abject horror (from their perspective) of apps with ugly interfaces being more common.


[deleted]


On every platform.


It’s sad that VS Code is touted as performant. It’s like everyone was either born after or never experienced fully native compiled applications on PCs. To those who have, the latency in response to actions alone (on these electron apps) is enough to annoy, much less how slow everything else is. Our computers are orders of magnitude faster than they were, yet application responsiveness is far worse. It’s maddening.

I know why companies do it, but I have no idea why they are rewarded for doing it, specifically for paid or subscription products. Clearly the money is there, so I must be in the minority, but I’d sure like to get back to expecting a good user experience that isn’t MVP in responsiveness.


WebKit doesn’t suck.


I’ve tried plenty of web apps using Edge and they never compare to a native app when it comes to features.


[deleted]


These kinds of exploits only give you access to the process at hand, the sandbox is still intact.


And what exactly can you scan it for? Besides absolutely trivial things like never calling instruction X (which should be then hardware limited, so no point again), you can’t really state anything (Rice’s theorem), apple claiming to check apps is just marketing.

The sandbox is the responsible party here that can add meaningful security measures.


Maybe I’m naive, but I have an adblocker on Safari, and I never used any other extensions on Chrome outside of the old Google Gears stuff that has since become standard. I’m happy with my browsing experience, but what am I missing out on with Safari? I don’t see any extensions that appeal to me.


Do you have specific examples of what you would call “shitty and archaic” behavior in WebKit? What exactly is wrong with it? And are you aware that Chromium’s Blink is just a WebKit fork, and likely has plenty of the same “archaic” code that it does? Or are you just on the mindless WebKit hate train?

>	improve their browsers to be better than safari which means more users which means more revenue 

This is where your argument falls apart. Do you pay for your web browser? No, they’re all free. Any kind of user tracking for ad monetization is possible to the same extent regardless of browser engine, since the engine isn’t engaged in that at all - that’s the code around it. All the engine does is render. So please explain how a better *engine* drives more revenue.


Oh… I gotchu now. I use [this](https://www.removepaywall.com/), you’ll have to inspect a lot deeper if it’s from GitHub (say… for Windows only?) but there should be some Shortcuts as well.


There's a difference between malware *existing* and and being "a cesspool of malware and complete garbage apps since day 2". 

Also, don't quote installation numbers like they mean anything. Even legitimate apps pay to have their numbers inflated (i.e. they're not all real people). Malware apps undoubtably do so as well.


> Part of the reason Mozilla has so much trouble is that they have to constantly work around the clock to keep up with Google’s stupid additions. 

If you actually clicked on the link, you'd see that Firefox is close to Chrome. Safari is far worse than both. And Mozilla is a relatively small non-profit, compared to Apple.

> And yes, Safari is behind, but it’s behind in things that don’t actually matter to the web.

If that was actually the case, then no websites would be using those features, and they wouldn't matter. Clearly not the case. 

> And again, the point that dozens of people have pointed out to you throughout this thread, that you continue to ignore and refuse to address, is that if developers do not support older standards, without forcing completely unnecessary new changes, then I cannot use whatever browser I want, and I will be forced to use Google’s.

As I've pointed out several times now, it's not a problem for the vast majority of websites. But if you want to use a website with features that Apple refuses to support, then you would indeed need to use a different browser. That's no one's fault but Apple's, so maybe you should encourage them to stop neglecting Safari?


History strongly disagrees with you.


You must be too young to remember when IE had a monopoly and what that did to the internet.


This is mostly speculation, which is pretty dumb considering that the code for both browsers is largely open source and available for review.


But now it’s in the specifications it’s my point. 

And yes, you could form blink or WebKit or gecko, but that’s not from scratch.


The point is they’re in the web specifications, despite the fact that basically no app needs them and any app that does should use a 3rd party api. 

But if you build a browser it needs to provide these features now.


> Hm I wonder why.

Maybe because the web is based on standards that Chromium abides by? Really that hard for you to accept? 

> You should be mad that Microsoft abandoned IE because of Blink's market dominance. 

And yet the new Edge is a way better browser for it. When you have competition, uncompetitive offerings will die off. Nothing bad about that.

> Having 1 major player in an industry is never, ever healthy. 

It's not one major player. Chrome is not the only Chromium browser by a long shot, and anyone can contribute to or fork the code base at will. Just as Microsoft has. 

Do you think Linux VMs should be banned from Macs because Linux is too dominant?


I just need a cross platform browser and in general i like safari, but as you said windows is lacking.

I also don’t find chrome or firefox good ios alternatives to Safari


Since the ability to set another browser as default on iOS, I haven't touched Safari

I haven't given Safari a chance ever, even when forced to use it, as I can use it on all my devices

Until Apple recognise Windows exists, then I won't give Safari a moment's consideration before the competition


spez is a greedy little pig boy


If you have multiple pcs and multiple macs it’s a huge pain to have different browser settings/bookmarks/history . I like safari better than chrome but eventually I just.  Couldn’t keep up with it.


A lot of that hate comes implicitly from the techies who have to make stuff work with it. It's always behind on standards and features underneath, stopping developers from making better stuff.

Firefox and Chromium remain the standard, Safari is the annoying Karen filling in for IE these days.


I don't see any significant performance or power benefit of Safari vs. Firefox on my MBP2019, personally.  And lack of good extension support and other things makes Safari a pretty tough sell for me.


Presumably by "Apple products" they mean "Mac".


Then Orion should do just lovely.


What other browsers do you have on the AppStore?


That's the naive assumption of it, but all of the "open source additions" to Chromium are almost entirely Google creations. It's no different than MS with Internet Explorer functionally, as developers of sites must abide by standards that *only* Google came up with rather than standards created by the larger web community as a whole

Like you said, Google forked WebKit and did their own thing with it. They decided to control the internet through their own standards


[deleted]


Your browser won’t work if it doesn’t match Chrome’s specs because developers won’t give a shit about you. 


“Just fork” is nonsense.


There's a huge difference between browser engines and Wikipedia.

If a browser (or engine) dominates beyond a critical mass, then developers will develop solely for that taking choice away from users.  Chromium is very close to that level.  

There is a very real concern that allowing Chromium on iOS could result in sites and services being developed solely for it, further eroding WebKit/Safari usage, and snowballing into less being developed for it.

So what if Chromium becomes the sole standard, since it's free?  Nothing if that's your preference, but everything if it's not.

Chromium, while free and open source, is still largely driven by Google, just like WebKit is by Apple.  Each one of these two companies have incentives to steer development towards their own interests.


I’m sure tons would.  

iOS’s HIG are a godsend.  

And generally well adopted outside of niche apps. Even Google moved to iOS HIG on most of their iOS apps. 

Losing that would be awful and I’d be frustrated using even more apps that aren’t intuitive (like Pokit).


Damn… at this rate what if Apple becomes the new Microsoft but maybe we'll start to see gaming first time on a mac eventually.


yeah you're right but it sucks that we only have one choice, that what sucks about this situation


[deleted]


Restricting JIT compilation still prevents third-party code (e.g. a website with JavaScript code) from being able to hijack the host process (e.g. a web browser). It also prevents app developers from being able to sneak in un-approved code like tracking or using private APIs (with the way Objective C works the only way Apple can prevent you from using private APIs is actually via the approval process rather than something more restrictive). If you cannot dynamically generate native code, it's actually a lot harder to call private APIs sneakily.

Also, sandboxes are not perfect. Lots of vulnerabilities require the ability to break out of sandboxes as part of the chain. Preventing dynamic native code generation is a defense-in-depth protection against vulnerabilities.

Obviously some of the above points can be litigated (e.g. WebKit has JIT because of practicality, so in a way Apple is already ok with the tradeoffs with having it, and sandboxes can be strengthened; and maybe Apple needs to relax more regarding private API usage). But there is some logic to restricting it.


You’re right that the sandbox should deal with it, but as we’ve seen time and time again sandboxes fail. You prevent apps from calling private system APIs, prevent apps from taking advantage of CPU errata (it happens a lot more than you think), mitigate ROP/JOP by ensuring all code is protected with hardware pointer auth. I’m sure they do even more that I’m not aware of.


If you are happy with one extension and one OS then you aren't missing much.

Loads of other people are though.


Thanks mate. If you can somehow get [this](https://github.com/qnoum/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean-magnolia1234) added to Orion please let me know. This extension covers pretty much every premium site that you can think of that doesn’t work on sites like the one you sent me


[deleted]


So how did Chrome become popular in the first place? It started from nothing. By your logic, it should be dead.


IE was run on a proprietary engine that Microsoft was sitting on, and they had exclusive control over that experience. 

Blink is an open-source, collaborative project run by both individual contributors as well as all of the corporate giants that would otherwise be homebrewing their own thing.

These two aren't the same situation, even though they both involve highly prevalent browser engines. Blink can be adapted and changed to meet people's needs and has a much greater chance of moving with the demands of the market. One entity can't just squat on the code and tell people to follow along, or people can and would fork the project. Google and Co can't block people from modifying the engine to fix something that a group doesn't like.

To ignore the open source and fundamentally different nature of the project would be as ignorant as calling the server industry dead because they all use variants of Linux.


Whatever Chromium decides is a standard turns into a standard. Chromium is unilaterally controlled by Google. You're a fool to believe otherwise.


The iCloud application for Windows has a Chrome Bookmark Sync extension. It’s a huge lifesaver because Chrome will sync anyways with my account but now safari on my apple devices is happy too.

Personally I don’t want history synced across devices so I don’t have a solution there.


I use the iCloud app on Windows to sync with whatever browser I’m using. Not as convienent as using the same browser on everything but I spend 90% of my time on macOS anyways.

You just expressed my thoughts much better than I did. :)

>If a browser (or engine) dominates beyond a critical mass, then developers will develop solely for that taking choice away from users. Chromium is very close to that level. 

Ultimately services are developed for users, not the other way around. If users like Safari/WebKit then they will keep using it and developers will target that. If the only way Safari/WebKit has users is because it is forced, then maybe it's not a very good product to begin with.


Agreed


I’ve developed for both browsers. Comparing standards compliant WebKit to IE is just ridiculous.


Calling private API is pretty trivial and Apple is unable to prevent you from doing it. This is why they rely on entitlements to gate access to sensitive data rather than requesting apps not call private APIs.


I still don’t see it. If you can call a private API (and that is not prevented by insufficient permissions), you are already lost. And browsers can just use separate processes for each tab, as they do on desktops, let the OS sandbox do its job. 

Preventing JIT is only meaningful for in-process “security”, which is not meaningful in case of every program, so it is not defense-in-depth, but an orthogonal issue. Like, what can happen with a JIT-enabled gameboy emulator? At worst it can corrupt my save, which it can do just as well without JIT and is not scanned by Apple at all.

Oh, and well-behaving apps should just themselves drop the privileges they don’t need.


Apple keeps their CPU errata private. Apps can already abuse it on macOS where there are no restrictions against this kind of thing. Their microarchitecural security posture is effectively to wait for their next generation of chips to roll out and silently fix it in that.

Also, apps already can call private APIs. Pointer authentication is not available to third party apps.


Loads of other people are happy with one extenstion? Or loads of other people are missing much? 

I was really asking what other people like on other browsers that I’m missing out on. Do you have an example?


Here, try [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypass-paywalls-clean/) and let me know.


So you're honestly going to tell me you don't believe that scam apps would fake their download numbers? Really...?


Google used its Search dominance to aggressively push Chrome. Every time you went to google.com, guess which ad you saw right in the dead center with big ol’ scare tactics. Works 99 times out of 100 on moms and people that don’t participate in threads like these.


Read your history books.  This stuff is covered in most business classes when discussing monopolies.


Blink is not as open source as you think. It’s staffed by none other than, guess who, a bunch of people from Google. It’s essentially regulatory capture. You’d be a fool for believing the best idea wins. No. In reality it’s: whatever *Google* wants to win, wins.


Google is not the only contributor to Chromium, and as I said, anyone who disagrees with their direction can fork it at will. Nor are devs forced to adopt any particular features.


That seems like a low blow. Whatever you think of webkit, it’s a far cry from what IE used to be lol.


It works on iOS last I checked


You think I don't know this? It's not a gotcha


"if people are sick of google search engine they can make a new one"

"if people are sick of youtube they can make a new one"

"*if people are sick of android they can fork it and make a new one*"

None of this happens because Google wants to control the internet


[deleted]


Well yes, and???


Do you remember IE?

Ultimately developers with limited resources will develop based on the number of potential users.  If share of a market is 90%+ then that very well may be worth focusing on and ignoring the <10% regardless of which product is better.

It's even worse when it's not at the platform level.  Telling users to switch to use Windows instead of macOS is a tougher proposition as compared to "Download Chrome".


yeah I agree, webkit is super safe.


Calling private APIs is trivial in code but App Store policy explicitly disallows doing so (see 2.5.1 under https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/). If Apple scans / runs your code and find you using them they could reject your code from App Store. I guess even without JIT, you could find ways to sneak in private API calls past the review process if you are smart but it’s much easier and trivial if you could distribute / generate binary code dynamically.


It depends massively on your requirement. That's like saying you only play apple arcade so why does everyone say macs aren't good for gaming.

Cross platform support is the major feature missing, it is why I don't use it on mac.


Working perfectly mate! Thank you. Didn’t realise it was on Firefox


> guess which ad you saw right in the dead center with big ol’ scare tactics

What "scare tactics"?

And lmao, you think *Google* was aggressive? Safari has shipped *preinstalled* on every iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Likewise for IE/Edge in Windows. That Chrome was able to overcome that inertia says a lot about how horrible browsers were before it.


You're not answering the question. And for that matter, you're *defending* Apple's monopolistic behavior.

You apparently don't know what open source even means.


The hell are you talking about? Google working on it (alongside half a dozen other major entities by the way) doesn't suddenly make it not open source.

‘It’s an iPad’


Like this iPad because of the price, but still tempted by the Air only because of the A12.


I’m debating picking one up as a side monitor for my MBP with the new sidecar feature in Catalina.


“No competition”

“7.5/10”


I absolutely love my iPad Pro, with IPadOS it handles most of what I need from a day to day


I used a PC for decades. Switched to Mac about 7 years ago. Bought an iPad about a year ago. 

I now find I can do about 90% of my work comfortably on an iPad. For the first time, I now travel with an iPad rather than a Mac - it’s a bit of a risk but usually I can get done anything that is urgently needed. 

The iPad is truly amazing and I’m excited to see where it will go.


quite literally 0 competition


would this be better than the 2018 Pro for notetaking as a student? ik the price difference is huge but do the advantages of the pro outweigh the price increase?


Big Ole' iPod Touch


My iPad Pro 11” got me back in to iPads. I try and use it more than my laptop. At home I’m purely on my iPad. The apple keyboard case helps so much. So does FaceID.


iOS 13 is a train wreck.  I have 13.2 and I’m still experiencing problems.  I should have waited a few months to update.


This is my first iPad and I love it. I couldn't refuse the selling point. I did a lot of research and was contemplating the Air. I wanted the faster processor but the .3" screen difference was a moot point. I like that it has 3GB of RAM and it seems to do everything I want it to do very fast. I've been impressed with it being my first iPad I've ever owned.

oOOoOh
-iPad mini 2019


I think everyone has ceded the tablet space to Apple. It's their market to lose now. And going by the looks of it, they're doing a bloody good job of alienating users with their iOS 13 update for the iPad. 

As for competition, I think Microsoft is redefining the future of computing. And while the iPad is still the best portable "computer", in a few years time as the platform matures, I think the surface will take that crown from it.


I remember when that used to be considered a bad thing. I love the new perspective that Apple invited when it got serious with the iPad Pro line.


Undisputed King of Tablets


If that’s your main reason for buying it, I would just get an actual monitor. You can get something decent for the 300 range.


Id highly recommend the iPad Air over the regular iPad. I just picked up an Air and its insanely impressive compared to my old 9.7” iPad Pro. The bigger 10.5” screen is crisper than my old Pro, A12 processor is stupid fast, and battery life is excellent. If you have a couple hundred more, id definitely get the iPad Air


make sure it works with non Pro ipad.


If that’s your main reason for buying it, I would just get an actual monitor. You can get something decent for the 300 range.


I mean you could get a way larger real monitor for cheaper


Honestly, I’ve been using Duet with my work Windows 10 laptop & it functions great in this capacity. Even responds to basic touch for scroll & zoom (usually use that screen for Adobe Pro DC) & you can even use the Smart Keyboard for input on either screen, which I believe are both features of 
Sidecar.


I’ve used mine for ad hoc sidecar for a while, having it next to my Mac while I’m working and using it for text messages or watching videos. It’s really handy, and I wasn’t even using it as a “true” second monitor.


If you have the cash to splash, hell why not !!


You should look into Duet Display. I’ve been using an iPad as a second monitor for the last 3 years or so. I love it when I’m working away from my desk.


It can have no competition and still have room for improvement


I mean, it’s technically not the best tablet out there. Apple itself has better options. They gave the Air an 8.5/10


Fucking love my 2018 ipad 9.7. Great value for your money and a very good secondary productivity device.


That should show you a lot about apple in the tablet space.


In many categories there is little completion and as a consequence even products that are not that great are the best thing you can get.

I’m currently looking for a digital photo frame and none of the choices are ones I particularly like, even that ones that are pretty unique and without competition and fulfill many of my requirements.


"No competition outside Apple"

I think the iPad Air has better value for money than this one.


>No competition*

*Except the iPad Pro


Which doesn’t make much sense

Older processor, yet completely capable 
Expensive accessories, okay get 3rd party 
32GB? I stream and use iCloud. easy. Or external.


I bought one, used it for school and stuff and I returned my MacBook Air. The iPad did actually everything I need.


I never thought an iPad Pro could be my daily driver. But damn, if iPad os didn’t make that happen very easily!


Took a business trip last week and like an idiot forgot my laptop. Luckily I had my iPad and keyboard with me and it handled everything really well.


Yup I’m daily driving an iPad Pro too. I’ve only needed my MacBook to update my phone to an iOS beta.


What’s your job?


There's a lot of PCs out there that function as tablets, though. Not something to brag about just yet but I think it's important that Apple not rest on their laurels lest Microsoft continue to improve the Surface and Windows as a tablet OS.


Nah man, I got this 7 inch android tablet with a cracked screen and outdated OS. iPad does not even have SD card slot. WEAK SON


I have a 2018 iPad (non-pro) - the 2019 is super similar. 

Note taking is quick and super responsive.  I have the Logitech Crayon (because it was cheaper than an Apple Pencil) and while it doesn’t have all the pressure sensors so drawing isn’t as good, for pure WRITING it works nearly as fast as actually writing on paper.

So if you’re just note taking, a base model is fine.

But use case will determine whether you should actually go more toward a pro.  Especially if you’re trying to use a tablet more in place of a full laptop/desktop as opposed to just something handy to take with you to class.


> would this be better than the 2018 Pro for notetaking as a student? 

I would advise you to check with your professors about note taking and use in exams. Some courses may/can be open notes exams, in which printed or electronic notes are forbidden. If those courses are frequent, it might not be the reason to buy one.


It'd be neat if this classic iPad insult still worked but unfortunately they don't keep the iPod Touch on the latest processors anymore


2019 version is basically a mini version at 10". 2018 is the real deal at 12".


That's an iPad


It's different. iPad almost has no competition because no other brand cares about tablets as much as Apple does. But in terms of phones, there are a lot of companies who try to innovate and compete with Apple's phones.


I think that could be a matter of preference for some in the phone space. But in the tablet space it’s pretty much hands down for the iPad.

I can’t remember the last time I saw someone using an Android tablet of any kind.

For me, it’s the integration. My favorite Apple product is honestly the Apple Watch at this point. So I’m not leaving the iPhone anytime soon (not that I’m unhappy).

I had moved away from my MBP to a cheaper laptop with Linux but recently went back to a 2019 MBP for development work just because it’s too good to have everything work together.

Taking conference calls with AirPods on the Mac, listening to music on the phone and being able to adjust the volume casually with my watch, using Siri to play a song on a whim, HomeKit for my Hue lights, and dock my MBP to a Vega64 eGPU when needed.

Apple may not be the best in each sector, but it’s damn convenient and usually does “just work.” MacOS Catalina is going to bring some really nice additions there too (Sidecar being the main one for me).


How is iOS 13 alienating iPad users? It’s an amazing update for iPad users...


I don’t get it. What’s wrong with ios13?


Lol what? iOS 13 is the biggest iPad update ever


Uh, what? You think it's overcomplicating matters, but those feature additions are what move it closer to the Surface, which is what you seem to prefer. Confusing to say the least...


>	As for competition, I think Microsoft is redefining the future of computing.

I think you haven’t used a Surface. It’s still Windows, and as a result, it’s still a great portable laptop, but sucks at any form of tablet usage.

Microsoft doesn’t even seem to push for making such apps.


As for competition, I think Microsoft is redefining the future of computing. And while the iPad is still the best portable "computer", in a few years time as the platform matures, I think the surface will take that crown from it.


I’ve been hearing that repeated every year, yet surface remains flat, while the iPad keeps rising.
Microsoft doesn’t seem to be doing anything special with the surface pro X either.
That’s the closest they have gotten to the iPad Pro.


> alienating users with their iOS 13 update for the iPad. 

This is true...because I have an iPad Air 1 and the iPadOS doesn't support it :(


[deleted]


It’s a fair tag line. The Verge just recycled the same line every year. It’s just lazy.


Not even Huawei can be the prince


Eh, can’t you use it as a drawing tablet in sidecar mode? I’d be interested in that


You can get one for $20 seccond hand, and it works perfectly.


“Decent”? For $300? 300 would get you a pretty high-end computer monitor.


You can't use an actual monitor on the go, though.


I’ve yet to see one with the resolution and quality of the iPad screens.


The iPad Air uses the A12. Still much faster than the A10 though.


I completely agree with you. The biggest deciding factor for me personally though on getting the Air is the laminated display and True Tone (over everything else including the A10 vs A12). I absolutely love True Tone as it’s much easier on my eyes.


Fair enough, but you can always get something better if you just "cough up a few hundred bucks more". The Ipad Ipad is a really good deal for the money, and honestly - for straight up tablet use -  movies, browsing, note taking, some gaming etc. i have a really hard time noticing any performance differences between the A10 and A12.   


The biggest drawback with the Ipad 2019 is 2 GB of ram, it does cause some reloading pages, especially when desktop browsing.


Yeah I thought about that but I also have a Mini which is basically the air but smaller (and I personally enjoy the mini for media consumption over the larger tablets).

But I agree the air overall is a much better device.  I wouldn’t recommend this iPad over the Air for someone who wants a tablet and plans to use the tablet as their main device.


Isn’t the iPad Air, the old 10,5” Pro?


It works with any iPad


It does


I saw somebody using it with a Mini in a beta test(I think anyway). I have a mini already just don’t know is the screen size on that would make working in excel files for work or photo editing productive haha


But it’s still an iPad. A backup device or something you can use on airplane rides. As a monitor though, iPads kinda suck. I’ve been using Duet for a while and the screen is just too small to be very useful.


Space really. I don’t have a work desk or anything, I just work at my kitchen table when I work at home


Try carrying a large monitor in your backpack around all the time. There’s a reason why duet and luna display existed and actually made money for years even before sidecar. Those portable usb monitors suck ass in terms of color, brightness, resolution, pixel density, and portability.. let alone draining more power


Looking at you, sports games.


But that isn’t what they’re saying.

The review goes out to say it is the same great thing as before, it just isn’t an air or pro. So it must be punished for that.


8.5 for the time it was released. I wouldn’t compare a score from 2013 to a score from 2019 as this iPad would’ve gotten a way higher score in 2013.


Or tablets in general


weeps in web developer


What changed in pad is for you ?


Work in a sausage factory


They haven’t been improving Windows as a tablet OS since 2015. It’s basically the same buggy tablet mode with janky animations. If I were Apple, I’d be more worried about ChromeOS convertibles.

This iPad has the same soc as the latest iPod


[deleted]


Pretty sure he's saying that it's nice to have your phone and tablet in the same ecosystem so the dominant position of ipad is an argument to choose iPhone.


Loads of ways. Everything is so complicated. Multiple versions of Safari in slide over is incredibly complicated. Moreover, even the basic task of selecting text using the cursor is so weird now, the magnifying glass is gone. These are just a few of my major annoyances. Minor ones exist all over.


Sorry but *iPadOS*


Vista was a BIG upgrade in windows history too. Doesn't mean it was any good.


Then we'll have to differ on this one. The surface devices are great because they run genuine desktop OSes which doesn't need me to relearn the functions of basic computing. It comes with a solid keyboard too. 

The iPad on the other hand was never designed to be this complicated. Safari tab switching in slide over is confusing to say the least. Apple has changed slide over functionality every single time single iOS 10. This is getting ridiculous at this point. A genuine surface competitor should simply run macOS or iOS with the same two or three finger gestures.


I think that's kinda the point, though. Steve Jobs refused to make a "mobile" version of the Apple website for a long time because he believed the experience should be uncompromising in features. He was selling pocket-sized devices that were expected to handle the same tasks a desktop PC could. If your computer could handle it, your iPhone could handle it.

Since it's inception, I've always felt that the iPad was a compromise between the hardware limitations that existed at the time and the full computer people were used to. It started out literally as just a large iPhone that couldn't make calls or take photos. Over time Apple has made improvements to iOS to improve its potential in the productivity scene, which has now become its own iPad OS, and that's fine. But now, since we're over the hardware limitations and the iPad Pro is as strong as your average laptop, I feel like they should have been more focused on how to bring macOS to a tablet instead.


It came out in 2013 and only has a gig of RAM. It had a decent run, but the memory limitations are real.


Did you read the entire comment.
He is hardly a fanboy.


What else there to say?


~~Yes, it'll have full touch support as far as I know.~~

Sorry for the misinformation, apparently it only works with Apple Pencil and some basic touch controls for now.


Help a fella understand this.

&#x200B;

is it for drawing in certain programs on a Mac? I do t own a Mac or indulge in any real art. I have a pro 11 and love it and like the idea of sidecar, and want my first Mac, but sidecar is limited to newer macs and.....I can just draw on my tablet without it being in this new mode...what’s the gain here?


There are third party apps which allow you to use the apple pencil on mac os. I’m not sure about the latency though


Does it have touch screen? Is it ultra portable? Does it double as a tablet? $300 is a great price for a ultra portable monitor that also doubles as a great tablet.


The cheap iPad doesn’t even have that good of a screen lol


The lag with Duet was pretty bad when I was using that a few years ago. I could basically only use it for ambient displays. Interaction was too painful. 

 Is sidecar going to be better?


My bad. The A12, as you say, is still leaps and bounds better than the A9X in my old 9.7” Pro and even the A10 in the regular iPad.


The display was a major deciding factor for me too. I didn’t want a downgrade from my 9.7” Pro, which the regular iPad would certainly be. True Tone is certainly a feature I love too and have on my iPhone, MacBook Pro, and now this new iPad Air. I think it’s pretty silly to not get the Air with the many benefits it has compared to the regular iPad. The regular iPad to me seems more of an education or bulk purchase type of device, since it really won’t have the longevity with its chipset and its lack of “modern” features.


I believe the latest base iPad has 3GB of RAM.


[deleted]


Too bad the opposite isn’t true for macs that can run Catalina but considering that forcing it to work on unsupported models looked and work horribly............yeah.............


It works with any iPad that supports Apple Pencil (1 or 2) so this new iPad is supported (6th gen) but not the previous one


You can also buy small portable monitors that connect using a single USB-C cable. They’re pretty sleek.


“It can have no competition and still have room for deterioration.” — Fifa career team motto


I remember "issues" from last years iPad Pro saying it doesn't do everything a laptop does.....well no duh it's not a laptop


Isn’t he talking about the new Air which was released recently?


It’s definitely not perfect but it works. Like some things can’t be clicked with the pencil and other things can. Sometimes I wish you could make it function like a full stylus.


Get work to buy you a MacBook for that.


On my side:

-	Multitasking is so seamless now. It works very similarly to traditional desktops. I can have multiple safari instances open, each with their own set of tabs for different tasks. 
-	I love the new grid and desktop view. Much less chunky, more task oriented. 
-	Files is just so well executed. Being able to save to any cloud storage and easily within any app is wonderful. 
-	Copying isn’t awful! It makes sense and is actually easy to use. When I make a mistake I understand why, so less frustration. 
-	The new screenshot and markup interface is insanely elegant. It’s light years ahead of desktop. I can markup a website or capture competitive info in a second. 
-	The mouse support is pretty great. Sure, it’s a hack. But in the few cases where I need it the thing works. 
-	I love, love, love the ability to have two apps open at the same time. Most apps support it now, so I can always have Youtube rolling on the side.
-	Shortcuts is like classic Automator on steroids. You can build a simple “if this, then this” task in seconds. What started as a neat toy is going to be supercharged in a year. Even today, I’m using multiple times per day. 
-	EarPods just work. This is less an iPad Os thing, but it is so nice to have a computer that doesn’t treat audio like a strange stepchild. Hopping into Spotify takes two seconds.
-	All of this, and I never see a stutter. Meanwhile I turn on my MacBook Pro and everything is just so slow. What takes 3 minutes on my Pro takes 1 on my iPad. 
-	I also purchased a new non-Apple keyboard. That is a big realization - Apple’s folio is just fine. Logitech’s keyboards are amazing quality and they have keys for search, home, volume, and light up keys, just like a laptop. 

My two cents!

my old lazy ass so i can sit in bed and read old people shit that i can't really see on my iPhone


iPads are super nice because there is a lot of good apps optimized on iOS. I just prefer to use iOS (I guess iPadOS now) for most of my computing


And this is where you read your comment again, bud.


I mean an android phone and tablet would share an ecosystem too. I agree Apple does a better job with this (mostly because google kinda gave up on their tablet os) but if you have a galaxy phone and tablet and you prefer android as an OS I’m sure it’s fine


Yeah, the new windowing takes some getting used to (and is a little hard to figure out TBH), but nothing is stopping you from using the iPad as it was in 2010. Tap an app, go home, tap an app, go home; so no one is being alienated. Haven’t had issues with the text selection features.


Dude what??? iPadOS allows for way more productivity. 

How is that a bad thing??


13 is the best iPad upgrade ever.


There would still be UI issues if you just straight up put a desktop OS into tablet device. A friend of mine uses a Surface Go, and navigating Windows 10 in desktop mode is absolutely horrendous if you’re not using a mouse and keyboard.


I know i'm not really that upset lol. Trying to see what I can replace it with that's cheap (another iPad i mean)


[deleted]


Anything about iPadOS besides that one mention that says it's buggy?


[deleted]


From what I understand, it acts as a second monitor, and being that it’s an iPad you have drawing support as well. So you’d be able to draw in Mac apps on your ipad


Literally none of those things are useful for the purpose of a monitor. OP stated that he wanted the iPad to use as second monitor, not because he wanted an iPad. Those are two different things. Reading comprehension is important. 

Things that matter on a computer monitor are things like size, color accuracy, refresh rate, resolution, etc. not “portability”.


been using sidecar on the catalina beta with ipados beta as well. ignoring some obvious bugs with connection quality that got ironed out as betas progressed, the delay is imperceptible. something that i haven't seen mentioned much is that the ipad will also pass through its keyboard input, so my keyboard connected to my ipad works with my mac without additional setup.

using 2016 macbook pro 13" and 2018 ipad pro 11" with logitech slim folio pro


I would assume so. I have a Luna and it’s basically no lag even at retina resolution.


Sure its better but for a default iPad and a default tablet this is the model to go for. It has compromises but it's far from being shit. Besides I'd bet money that most people just use iPads for basic consumption.


And is cheaper. The 10.5" Pro was $649 until it was superseded by the $499 Air.


It makes sense as unsupported devices are using the CPU to encode HEVC since they don’t have hardware encoding.


The previous iPad 6th gen supports pencil 1, so yes it does. This is the 7th gen.


New is 7th, 6th was the 2018 9.7” model with Apple Pencil 1.

last time (about a year ago) I checked, these were pretty bad quality. would love one that actually had a good display.


If EA weren't "master of licences", PES would definitely be competition.


Those are issues in a product that's marketed as a laptop/computer, which is very much what Apple is doing with the iPad pro. 

It is a tablet but Apple wants to push it as a laptop/computer competitor, which should be pretty obvious when you look at their marketing. So if it falls short on what a laptop can do, then Apple is marketing it at the wrong crowd or they need a better product.


That’s what I use. Just wish it could be done on an iPad.


You'd have to download the Kindle app to read Kindle content no matter what, even on Windows. All Kindle e-book purchases these days are DRM encrypted and readable only through the Kindle app. Having a separate reader would only help for PDFs and other unencrypted ebook formats.


Whoosh? Pretty sure he's saying that it's nice to have your phone and tablet in the same ecosystem so the dominant position of ipad is an argument to choose iPhone.


Do you realise how many times slideover gestures have changed since iOS 10? It’s like Apple is designing a completely new gesture every time. Affects usability.


They’re doing a bloody good job of alienating users with their iOS 13 update.

I think the surface will take the crown from it.


oh? Maybe I got that confused. I haven't tried it yet but I thought it would allow for all or most iPad inputs. If it doesn't but it's a feature you'd like then Luna Display is a great alternative.


It’s only two finger touch control. That’s used for scrolling and zooming. But everything else has to be done in the Apple Pencil


Having a touch screen for Adobe is insanely useful. And how is portability not useful? You gonna carry a huge gaming monitor with you and find a plug in everywhere you wanna use it?


A pressure and tilt sensitive touch/stylus monitor is the entire conceit of the Surface Studio.


[deleted]


And doesn't have four speakers like the pro did


It was a hidden setting you could do from the terminal in early betas, did they remove it?  It worked fine with slightly lower image quality (but fantastic latency).

I don't like when Apple removes things that work, like audio sharing on older iOS devices - it worked completely fine and they pulled it towards the end of the betas.


>The previous iPad 6th gen supports pencil 1, so yes it does. This is the 7th gen.

ah thanks


[deleted]


They don’t work at all. Only Apple Pencil models.


Asus has an oled one for $4k. An iPad is one of the better quality displays you can get at a consumer level and it does a bunch of other shit. It’s worth it and way better than building up more single purpose tech junk. You wont regret it


Progress is being made. Juventus isn’t in Fifa 20


PES?


Well the way I interpret it is Apple is pushing it to replace MOST of what a laptop can do. They're not going to come out in the ad and say, it does these things, but if you want to do this, then no sir, go get a laptop.


Not a web dev , but would Coda not suffice?


Tablets are definitely not as popular as laptops!


Yeah, being able to airdrop things between the devices is nice.

And now you're copy pasting defense from your alt account.

How low do you have to be?


If my grandma can understand how to use the new gestures and you can't, I'm beginning to suspect that your username is a misnomer of who you really are.


Tried it on my Pro and it’s only for Apple Pencil which is weird. Touch works for the keyboard and pressing the buttons for command, option etc. on the left hand side. It’s like using a stylus on a windows tablet


[removed]


I use my iPad as a primary monitor. I have a Headless MAC mini that I plug in and in junction with Luna Display (Sidecar cannot activate without an already on monitor so Luna fulfills that purpose). I travel with my Mac mini and only plug it in when there’s stuff to do that my iPad can’t (programming).


Or the amazing 120hz screen. I'd still pick up the old 10.5 Pro over any of the new iPads since it's much cheaper now


It didn’t work fine though. The frame rate was terrible and ruined battery life. Software encoding HEVC will never work “fine” unless you have a desktop with a beefy 6-8 core CPU and are fine with lower image quality than alternatives like NVENC on Intel’s video encoding.


Yeah...........if you consider slideshow animations, grainy quality, color banding to be fine on before Skylake models.

It really made sure my 2012 dual core mini look like it’s choking on it’s own digital vomit. One of the reasons why i took the plunge and upgraded to a 2018 model.


That’s exactly what I just said.


He said the previous 6th gen supports Pencil and Sidecar. You’re the one who’s confused.


Yea true it’s an awesome display and you also get an iPad lol. I kinda forgot the 12.9 pro existed too. With a MacBook that’d be pretty amazing.


Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer. It doesn't have all the official licences so it's often overlooked, but it's a better game in my opinion.

Not to validate the opinions of that other user, but I think the days of "so simple, your grandma can use it" are long over. I can't even convince my own mother, who is not someone I'd call technologically illiterate, to upgrade to an iPhone past the 8 because she can't comprehend how to use it without a physical home button and fingerprint scanner. The average elderly person could probably figure out how to make calls and take photos and stuff with an iPhone, but I honestly wouldn't trust them to figure out how to use anything more complicated than that. Unless they were handheld through a sheltered experience, I don't think most elders would be able to figure out the newer iPads.


lol right. I bet my workflow is a little more complicated than your grandmother's. And I can bet you my entire wealth that your grandmother doesn't understand how multiple tab switching in slide over mode works in Safari. 

We should stop trivialising user issues.


Ooh, ok. Then I was completely confused. I held off getting Luna Display just to see how sidecar works but, for now, it doesn't seem to be the same kind of product or feature that offers the same feature sets. It's more of a monitor replacement than it is turning an iPad into a hybrid like device. Thanks for that info!


That is the benefit of using the iPad. I’ve already seen several people use Sidecar in public for duel monitor setups that are incredibly mobile. And like I said a gaming monitor isn’t going to let you use it as a drawing tablet, which is insanely useful.

I love the look of the latest Pro, but usability wise the 10.5 is exactly the same. Got a 256 for $450 I believe. A friend got a 512gb with LTE and apple care from amazon for something stupid like $350. Its definitely a much better investment. Oh I also got the keyboard for $40, a leather sleeve for $25, and a Smart Cover for $12.


Well, great. I bought it on launch (10,5” Pro) and haven’t been jealous of any of the newer ones. Good to know there are a lot of people thinking like I do 😄


Honestly, a beefy 6-8 core CPU still isn't going to save you. Encoding a HEVC stream in real-time is very demanding and basically requires dedicated hardware.


> Software encoding HEVC will never work “fine” unless you have a desktop with a beefy 6-8 core CPU and are fine with lower image quality than alternatives like NVENC on Intel’s video encoding.

While I totally agree trying to live HEVC encoding without a hardware encoder is asking for a bad time, Quicksync and NVENC are easily *worse* quality than software encoding.  They're just much, *much* faster.


Oof.. I'm simply asking for them not to go out of their way to remove the ability to ignore the blacklist like they did - I don't think that's unreasonable.


This whole thread has been painful.

"Lash out"

Guess who's mad getting called out? Certainly not me.


Does your mom still love her iPhone as is? If so, you're not supporting the opinion of the other user. Because you can still use the iPad just fine without the gestures.


> And I can bet you my entire wealth that your grandmother doesn't understand how multiple tab switching in slide over mode works in Safari.

OK, what's your PayPal? If she can't perform multiple tab switching in slide over in Safari I will send you 100 Euros. If she can, you send me 200 Euros. Fair?

> We should stop trivialising user issues.

This feature didn't exist before and people did just fine lmaooo no one is forcing people to use these gestures you could still use the iPad just fine. But I'm guessing you're too narrow minded to understand that.


Will you be now getting Luna Display then ?


Sidecar should work since it just needs WiFi open not connected to anything.

I downloaded it but have yet to use it. I use my Mac mini since I prefer to use Atom as an IDE.


I had the 10.5 pro till I got my MacBook pro and it was fantastic. The screen alone made it an absolute joy to use and just randomly scroll throught the pages


Which sale did Amazon have to sell the iPad pro 512gb for just 350. Are you in the USA?


3700X has decent ffmpeg performance when converting H.264 to H.265 over CPU. I thought that would apply when using CPU encoding for sidecar.


Actually for this one, i’m glad they did made this restriction. After all, it’s a feature that made use of a hardware accelerated process and one of the main uses for Sidecar is to be a supplementary screen for your art project and showing up with loss of quality is not a good thing.


No *you’re* painful.


Phone: (edit: MicroSD)~~SD~~ Card slot, benefits of more functionality that come with Android (customizability, versatility i.e. a real file system, default apps, much less "walled in" experience), plus some of Samsung's QoL features (edge screen, secure folder, scrolling screenshots) and Dex (which I don't use but I can see how it could be useful). I have an Android phone because iPhones just don't fit the bill for me.

Tablet: All the benefits of Android, but the shortfalls in app selection and updates are much more pronounced. I have an iPad pro because Samsung tablets are just not as good of a product for me. 

That said, android tablets can behave a lot more like an actual computer...iPadOS has almost caught up in terms of functionality but it's still not there. Sure, you can now have folders and copy paste, but that's it. It's an extremely basic file manager. There is no undo button or progress dialog/cancel button for file transfers, and you can't select multiple files when you search (as of 13.1.2), which is just ridiculous. I accidentally duplicated about 200 photos and there was no way to stop the process or easily undo it after the fact. Also, camera roll remains separate from the "filesystem" so there's no photo organization possible--not true on Android with an actual filesystem. That being said, though, imo there's really no reason to get an Android tablet because the apps just are not there. May as well get a Surface at that point so you have a REAL "desktop" OS to make up for lack of apps.


Andriod in general has many benefits over ios. My personal favourite is just how customizable it is. Or the built in screen recording on my device, or desktop mode from my phone


[Samsung DEX](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/samsung-dex/) alone is enough of an argument over the iPad. It'll actually transform the tablet/phone into a full fledged Linux desktop machine, rather than Apple's excuse of a "what's a computer?"


Can she perform these gestures? And more importantly, use them on her own? If you say yes, your grandma is in the 1% of tech users. In which case, her opinion about usability doesn’t matter.

>	This feature didn’t exist before and people did just fine lmaooo no one is forcing people to use these gestures you could still use the iPad just fine. But I’m guessing you’re too narrow minded to understand that.

Apple has changed the way slideover works every single time since iOS 10. Maybe you’re a new iOS user and haven’t experienced the mess.


Yes, I think I will go that route for now. I'm not sure what plans Apple has for Sidecar but it would be cool to get these kinds of features natively in the future. Building my Mac Mini iPad Pro hybrid.


It was a bit of a fluke. If you look at the renewed models, they generally have the rose gold 512gb LTE for around $400. The prices fluctuate constantly. She got 256gb, and received a 512 LTE, with AppleCare that had almost the full term left on it. So not exactly an easily reproducible deal, but if you keep a lookout on there you can get some amazing deals. And yes im in the US.


It is faster, but not fast-enough to keep up with a real-time stream at low latency.


I think just because you won't use something doesn't mean you should wish everyone else not be able to use it either, but to each their own.


I think you’re confused.

Yes, now link me your PayPal so I can send you a video. This is the easiest 200€ I've ever made lmao

And nah I just showed her a few times how to do it. She doesn't care much for it but yeah.

Lmao my first iOS wasn't even called iOS at the time. Try again.


Nice overview!  Is it a lot heavier than the Smart Keyboard?  Do you like it better so far?


This is not OP's review. We reached out the person in the video, u/MrExitStrategy, and he'll be able to answer your questions, make sure to tag him in your comment, so that he can be notified.


For me next to the price issue it seems to be too bulky and heavy for a leightweight like the ipad is. In price, weight and bulkiness i think you can also get an 13`` mba and maybe mbp. But of course: great 'magical' concept


Think I’m better off waiting for some 3rd party stuff with the lack of book mode.
And with it being heavy


Thank you for the video, u/MrExitStrategy! I saw your 10 minute video on the MacRumors forums showing how to control the keyboard backlight from Settings. Few extra questions:

1.  Is it possible to adjust the brightness from Control Center - either in the brightness slider or as a new button that appears in Control Center?
2. What about a keyboard shortcut to adjust brightness?
3. Finally can the backlight by turned off completely or just very dim?

Thank you for your videos and answering our questions!


can it be folded backwards for tablet mode?


Really nice, didn’t know it had it owns USB-C charging port. Makes it much more convenient. I currently own a keyboard folio and might replace it with this but I’m afraid it won’t be compatible with future iPads and that price is something to consider tho


I know you shook off that orientation issue there but it’s got me thinking that’s going to happen more often than we think. 

I constantly run into the issue now, could only imagine it being worse on that.


Nice. I will have my Logitech combo touch keyboard with trackpad for 7 gen iPad on Tuesday so also will give some feedback


Do you have the 11” one or the 12,9”?


[deleted]


I already ordered the 12.9 inch model for my iPad Pro. But after looking at these first couple videos on YouTube, I’m starting to think the Smart Keyboard Folio that I have now is better. The new magic keyboard is easily “twice” the weight of the Smart Keyboard folio. The keyboard looks like a full on MacBook Pro keyboard. I believe a MacBook Pro is going to be more “portable” than an iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard :/ Just my thoughts. What do you guys think?


Okay, so I went to the post office next door and finally weighted the thing... It is **590 grams**! So twice as heavy as the folio keyboard.


300 bucks for a keyboard?! man, let's summon Logitech engineers...


This would’ve been an instant-buy if it were around 250$ even.


Sweet! I was curious if it used the force touch trackpad but seems like it's a real click but can be clicked anywhere! How come Windows laptops don't have this yet?


In some videos it appears some form of corner protective case can be used with the keyboard.   


Is there any further indication that something such as a silicon case can be used in conjunction with the magic keyboard?


Wait, what happens if I need to lay the iPad flat on a table to take handwritten notes?


This is going to make the wait for mine even worse. This is perfect for all my use cases with the ipad. The smart keyboard has served me well, but my biggest gripe is when I'm using it for long sessions of writing, I have to use my finger to move the cursor around and stuff, and that just kind of gets old. So having the track pad next to me at my desk has been good, but that doesn't help me when I'm on the go. (Not that I'm going a lot of places recently). But even so, being stuck in the house is making me want to move away from my desk every now and again and this will let me step away from my work desktop and do personal stuff away from my main desk which has become a workspace for me. 

In other words, this is the ipad experience I've been waiting for. :)


Can you tap to click with the trackpad instead of hard pressing it like a button?


What are we to do with our old keyboard folios?


Kind of disappointing how this makes an iPad bulkier than a MacBook Air.


sweet thanks!


“The typing experience is...uh...prettygood”


when they announced it, i was genuinely hyped, because it does seem to make the ipad more macbook-y.

but seeing it in action i don't think i'll buy it. mind you: i already own a logitech slim folio pro, which gives me

a) a great keyboard (typing experience, backlit, extra row /w function keys)   
b) 3 different positions for my ipad (reading: flapped keyboard behind the ipad; ipad slightly angled on top of my keyboard (great when you're working with the pencil); and the classic laptop-like setup)   
and c) all that for a reasonable price (paid 99€ iirc).

what i would like about the magic keyboard: 

\- the trackpad and the keyboard, though the latter not necessarily more than the logitech's.

what i would not like:

\- no angled mode to use it decently with a pen,  
\- no book mode,  
\- usb-c port just charges and doesn't pass through data or video  
\- and a price-tag that's beyond what any person should ever pay for a keyboard (and i often shake my head at price tags in the (diy) mechanical keyboard category).


$350 and no force touch trackpad? Also doesn’t seem to be suitable for a tablet mode... its a good accessory but i expected more for that price.


Nearly 50% heavier than the iPad. No force touch trackpad. No angle adjustment. No way to fold the keyboard completely back. $300. No fucking thanks.


I love all things apple but I just can't justify that price tag. When an ipad pro and the keyboard cost the same as a macbook pro really hard to justify getting the ipad. I get the portability of an ipad (I have both) but that keyboard is just crazy expensive.


[deleted]


does the touchpad have tap to click?


Nobody complains that the price of a new 12.9” 256GB iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard is probably more than a MacBook Air with the same storage?

Or that the keyboard alone costs more than an entry level iPad?

I dunno, for me the above combined with the lack of the main purpose of the iPad (book mode) make me skeptical and hesitant.


I want this so bad but the price is ridiculous. €399 for the 12.9 inch iPad. Thats almost half the price of the damn device. I get its super innovative and all but I could never imagine paying that much for it.


The keyboard looks a little cramped for the 11" version


I don’t have an ipad pro but this is actually worth putting your money on. It’s really gorgeous, ergonomic, and just... wonderful piece of tech.


The only disappointment I see from this video is that the keyboard appears to be using the sloppier backlighting from previous generation MacBooks.  

As far the weight, I think the audience for this product would most likely use it on a desk, so not a huge issue. It’s nice Apple is listening to complaints about the Smart Keyboard, and continues to iterate on it, but these things don’t come for free, and we see that reflected in the cost and weight.


Hi, I have the iPad 12.9" 3rd Gen Brydge keyboard (non-touchpad), in terms of weight how does this compare?


Does it have support for right mouse button clicks?


hello, a stupid question : does it work using the ipad's battery or it has a battery in it? :p


Waiting for some artist's reviews to know how is it like to work on that angle, or if there's more angles at all, but DAMN pretty damn excited! Love that the hinges seems to snap super strongly into the different positions.


Backlit is the game changer for me.  I actually love the smart folio but desperately need it to be backlit.


Have you tried flipping the case around laying the top part on the table instead? If you do that , does it keep its weight distrubution even and can you write on it normally?


I was debating on whether to get an iPad Pro or an iPad Air 3. I picked the iPad Air 3 due to the availability of the [Logitech Combo Touch](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/combo-touch.html). Similar functions and also designed with Apple. Also contains a function row. Mine should be delivered early next week.


How totally fucked is it that I’m considering buying one of these for my 11” when I don’t plan to use it as a keyboard trackpad. 

I just want a magnetic powered charging stand for my bedside table. 



Why does no one want to make magnetic stands, or stands that charge the iPad over the smart connector. 


So frustrating


Hi u/MrExitStrategy. No questions about the keyboard but thanks for the review. My question is about where are you’re from. How long have you lived in Thailand? Do you like living in Texas or Thailand more? Why? I’m thinking about moving there from America, my job allows it, but this pandemic thing has been debating. Any help of insight would be greatly appreciated.


You stole my thunder


would you say that its rigid? always super scared of my ipad bending. cheers


Am I a laptop now?


I see it isn't just my ipad pro that has the rotation bug.  At least 50% of the time I have to turn it sideways then back again to get it to orientate correctly.


The thing that bothers me is the Folio keyboard is a solid sheet and so crumbs, spills, rainwater, etc don’t damage it at all. This is more like a regular keyboard. I hope they make an updated one like the Folio for the new iPads. It also looks really heavy.


Amazing features and incredible technology, except the price on the keyboard is disgusting.


[removed]


Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you're able to fold the iPad over the keyboard if you wanted to write/draw using the Apple Pencil.
  
I think if you want to use the Apple Pencil, you will have to write/draw awkwardly while the iPad is attached to the keyboard, or you will have to remove the iPad from the keyboard.
  
If you watch Apple's commercials for this keyboard, you'll see that every time the user goes to write/draw on the iPad, the user is removing the iPad from the keyboard. This is kind of a clumsy design imo.
  
Anyone have any thoughts?


So much effort to make it look like a laptop.. something that already exists.


Man, if the 11 inch iPad is 471g, I wonder how heavy is the 12.9 inch one... I know the weight has to be heavy to support the float, but fingers crossed it become heavier than my macbook pro lol


take my money? Bud, this is just over 5 bills CAD. That is nothing short of absurb. I have the pencil 2 and the smart folio,but there is no way in hell anyone should pay this. There is no difference between this and the $699 wheels from apple.


Glad I saw this. Canceled my order. No book mode os a no-go for me.


Looks awkward as fuck


The price is more ridiculous now lol . Why not buy a cheap leyboard and some smart folio to use if you will use it in desk (Heaaavy) and you can use smart folio alone , but with this you need to buy another folio if you carry it around . pointless


Still 3 more weeks till release here!


[deleted]


/u/MrExitStrategy any idea what’s the exact weight difference between smart folio and this magic keyboard?


Thanks for the quick review. Unrelated question tho, what screen protector are you using (I noticed it’s matte). Do you use it with an Apple Pencil? Does it distort the screen at all?


I really wanted to see some actual 2 hand typing on his lap to see the level of wobble lol


Thanks for making this video. Glad we didn’t have to wait all the way till May.


As a Galaxy Tab S6 owner (even though we've had the Book Cover Keyboard with the trackpad) I'm really jealous of that backlight keyboard, the passthrough charging and that awesome floating design. Especially the backlight keys and the floating design. That's something we definitely need. If we don't get the floating design, at least the backlight keyboard.

&#x200B;

I just wish that stand would lean back further. But other than that, love it. I wonder if that would be better for on your lap or no.


Damn. They really didn’t add an Esc key.


[deleted]


Does anyone have an idea as to why they couldn’t make the case fold 360°?


How fast does it charge with the new port?!


But does the keyboard flip all the way to the back? That’s the key point I want covered


does the trackpad seem small or cramped?


For work or entertainment? 

Workentainment?


Too expensive. If Microsoft Surface Pro can give good keyboard case with a trackpad, backlit keys for$150 why does Apple charge $350?


Ah. Gorgeous. I am still waiting for mine one to get delivered...


Hey there u/MrExitStrategy. Is there any way we can completely flip the case?   
I would like to completely flip the keyboard to the back instead of taking the cover on and off.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ndl1FMQ2A&t=

More Q&A


Where’s the Apple logo we were told would be on it?


I actually love it and am happy I ordered it (will arrive Monday)!

My work is heavily type-based (teaching, writing articles) and therefore I use my iPad in two scenarios only:

a) I want to use my iPad as a full laptop replacement with a lot of typing involved --> way better to type on vs. the smart keyboard, easier to carry around than my current setup (magic keyboard 2+ Fintie carrying case OR smart cover)

b)  I want to use my iPad as a tablet (e.g. when I walk through my class): It will be super easy to remove it from the case.

I can definitely see the issues some people have with this (e.g. folding flat, price, weight etc.), but for me it's perfect as I never liked the Smart Keyboard or similar solutions:
it is too heavy (or too cumbersome to remove the iPad from the cover) to really use it as a tablet only and too bad a typing experience to use as my main keyboard...

--> worst of both worlds vs. this case --> best of both worlds: a dock for typing and lightweight (naked) as a tablet


How did he get one already?!


Fam how are all these people getting these so fast! Give me a few more weeks to save up!!!!!


I was debating wether to get the 11” or 12.9” but chose the 11” because I had a feeling this magic keyboard would be heavy. Glad I went for this one!


same length of time at it’s my work machine. i have zero issues on mine. typing experience is sweet. would it survive a drop, no. but a very padded bag and care, it’s been rock solid. but is the new one worth half a grand, shit no. no keyboard is.


350 bucks.... oof I want to upgrade to a new pro so bad....


Looks nice, but far too expensive for what it is. I’m not going to spend more than a third of what I did for the actual iPad Pro for a keyboard case. It costs as much as a HomePod. Think about that...


This looks sooooo good 😍


I got my magic keyboard delivered today and so far so good the keyboard is great and feels super sturdy (much more so than the smart folio). One thing I didn’t realise is you need to go into settings and active the ‘tap to touch’ for the trackpad otherwise you have you physically click every time you want to select something on screen!!


Are there any cases that you can use with this keyboard that lets the iPad open and close with no hassle?


It’s expensive. It makes the iPad heavier. But, I love it. I have been using the iPad as my main computer for years. The keyboard erased a lot the issues I had with trying to work on the iPad. Could it be better? Yes. But, dammit, they did a real good job with this keyboard. Way better than the folio in my opinion.


They put a backlight in a keyboard for an iPad, but don’t make one avalible for the Mac desktops...


Can you still use the keyboard if your iPad is disconnected from it? I have my iPad Pro in an iMac-like setup right now.


Will the new keyboard work with the previous gen iPad Pro 12 inch? The only physical difference is one camera lens versus three.


Honestly, I would get the new iPad or the 2018 model just for that magic keyboard. This is a big step for Apple since they’re bringing the mobility of the iPad together with the workability of the MacBook. One downside though is the limitations on the iPad for apps... Surely Apple will allow third party apps to be installed. Once they allow that, the iPad will undoubtedly become a mainstream ‘computer’.


Instabuy!


Cool and all but I don’t need it because I don’t need a track pad.

That’s because I don’t intend to use my iPad as a laptop replacement.


If you believed that adding a pointer is all its needed to convert a mobile Os into a desktop Os


Bad news people.


Hard pass. Lifelong Apple devotee but the current Magic Keyboard has failed on me and been replaced 3X, it’s no loner working again. And that price is ridiculous. 

EDIT: It’s funny how Reddit works. I have firsthand valuable experience with the first generation of this keyboard. It’s a failed product imo and I am sharing that. And for that people downvote.


Honestly, the price point is not justified. If the logitech ones(for the air/older pro) were available for the ipad pros, i would much rather prefer those


Is there any « writing position » where you can lean it, to write on with the pencil or do you have to take it from the keyboard?


This keyboard is nice, but I think it is overpriced. Its price is higher than the some good logitech wireless keyboards.


Hope they implement a Touch Bar in the next version


I'll keep my notebook / iPad combo, thank you very much.


I guess now I know why my onscreen keyboard suddenly turned into an unresponsive piece of trash...


Take my middle finger. 300$ simply not worth it.


Desk is a mess...


How about, instead of putting all that money into a crappy laptop, why not buy an actual laptop for the same price?


I do like it better! but it IS a lot heavier than the smart keyboard! I'd say almost twice as heavy!


It's not his video, and he doesn't own one, hence "take my money".

But we'll contact the person behind this review and see if he has time to answer some questions.


He’s answering questions on macrumours forums


It's so easy to remove the iPad from the keyboard though. Either you have it in your lap or desk to use in "laptop" mode, or quickly take it off to use as a tablet. 

I guess transporting the full unit is a little harder because of the weight.


[deleted]


Totally agree.  Why did they have to make it so heavy and might as well get a MBP or MBA, especially for the price.   Very disappointing to hear about the weight.   Totally defeats the purpose of the iPad.    Sound like the Magic Keyboard is not that magical.   We shall see.


Anything with a hinge like this, a backlight, and more key travel is going to be heavy. You can’t beat physics.


I honestly think the best solution is a folio, combined with the magic keyboard + trackpad.

Obviously you wouldn't be able to use in on your lap, but it's perfectly fine in a coffee shop at a desk, etc. Toss them in a bag and away you go :)


An alternative would be Logitechs Slim Folio for the iPad Pro. Less than half the price, backlit keys with a row of iOS shortcuts and it can be folded to book mode! Only downside is the weight and lack of trackpad.


I’m pretty sure the book mode is just taking it off of the keyboard. It seems a lot easier to remove than on the current folio case.


1) I do not see an option to add the brightness adjustment for the keys in the control center
2) Nope, haven't found that either.
3) Yes, you can turn it off completely


It can’t


Doesn't appear to since it locks in. I guess your expected to remove it for tablet mode.


Nope


It would be fairly clumsy to use like that given how bulky and heavy it is.


> I’m afraid it won’t be compatible with future iPads

It would be really embarrassing for Apple if this isn't compatible with the next iPad Pro. Unless the next iPad/Air support it a bit like with the first-gen pencil.


You need to tag /u/MrExitStrategy so that he can be notified of your question. I believe that’s a 11".


According to his comparison video he put out, this is the 11”


My MacBook Pro has bleed through light on the keys. It’s a mid 2014 though.


I think this is intentional, all Apple keyboards do it


I had it ordered and canceled after watching these videos. No book mode is a complete no-go for me. I don’t want a docking station, I want something that I can use on the fly, anywhere. I don’t need a docking station, I have a MBP for long typing sessions on a desk. The Smart Keyboard Folio (which I have) is much more versatile imo.


Just wanna say i really appreciate and thank you so much for doing all the hands-on and review videos! i and for sure many other learned a lot more info from it 😀 Stay safe and healthy!


I wish Logitech would take advantage of the magnets though. Not a fan of how they make it like a wrap around cover as opposed to a magnetically attaching case.


My buddy works for apple and got it for me with his 25% discount, at this price it's def worth it but I don't know if I'd want to pay full price.


Jesus, how much does the damn thing cost?


The price will drop after the initial surge of “Oooo new shiny!” Buyers wear off. 

To be honest, I have one preordered. *guilty*


Some do! Or at least my Dell XPS 17 does


Windows laptops have had it. People **hate** it. Hopefully this is better.


I think I saw one review of someone using it with their coverbuddy case and said the magnets are strong enough to hold it


There's actually many cases and skins with cutouts for the three pins of the smart connector. Apple should have included a super light skin in the box for those who don't want to use the iPad with no case.


Take it out of the case it looks like


On top of that, there's now an actually decent keyboard with scissor mechanism and the same key travel as the 16" MBP. Writing should be much better than the folio.


that should work because it’s built into the ipadOS software as an option for any trackpad


I have this problem too. A perfectly good 12.9” folio. Slightly worn but not useless... surely I shouldn’t just throw it away or keep it in a drawer forever?


This. Does anyone want one?


seriously. wish Apple had a trade-in program for their accessories


Keep it as a lighter option to swap out when portability is more important than functionality.


Send it to me?  I’d use it.


put it up on ebay


That has been the revelation with these kind of devices from the beginning - by the time you make a keyboard that is heavy enough to counteract the weight of the tablet, you end up with a device that is a bit more bulky than the slimmest laptops - but that's only because a laptop is more naturally balanced - all the weight from the battery and chassis is on the bottom while the screen half can be made as thin and light as possible.


yeah but there ist no other way, because the case has to be on the front and back of the ipad.


Exactly. I love my iPad, but I don’t really see why I’d spend a bunch on an accessory that turns it into a ‘laptop’ rather than just using a thin laptop for laptop tasks. A laptop can generally can do more than an iPad anyway. An iPad is great for drawing, writing, reading, and general media consumption. A laptop is great for getting work done. This hybrid seems pretty cool, but it’s not as good as a laptop, and makes the iPad way bulky and heavy. Yes I know that you can remove the iPad from it easy, but then why buy the keyboard at all if you’re not going to use it?

Weird that it's not force touch right?  I expected when they advertised that it clicked anywhere that it definitely would be.


Why would there be force touch? There is no such thing as a pressure-sensitive iPad display so why would the trackpad support something that is not built into the operating system?


It's trying to be a full laptop replacement, the bottom needs to be heavier to even out the distribution of weight for the iPad, makes using it on the lap much easier.


I like how quickly we got over Apple slipping trackpad support into a dot update and we’re already complaining that it’s not force touch.

I have a Magic Trackpad 2, force touch doesn’t dramatically enhance my experience with it.


not to mention no media keys, bleed through backlight, and no way to fold back the keys


Keys are plastic. The screen is glass. Thus, under the Mohs scale of hardness, it’s impossible for the keys to scratch the iPad screen. Just don’t let sand or dirt onto the keys. For obvious reasons, regardless.


Yes


It isn't even really innovative, its just some hinges.


Yeah I think it'll be a normal size in 12.9"


If this would fold over all the way, I’d get it despite the weight. Now I’m not so sure.


Don’t the keyboard, but on my Magic Trackpad, it’s a tap with 2 fingers for right click


The keyboard case itself is powered by the iPad, no battery


You would probably have to take it off, which apple seems to communicate heavily in the marketing material. 

They seem to be portraying it as a very portable docking station rather than a full  case. I imagine alot of people might keep it besides the iPad in the bag even.


That seems pretty crazy, but to each his own. Certainly surprising that Apple hasn’t made a charging stand.


Seriously thought I had already replied to this, but doesn't appear to be so...  I'm from Thailand but have been living in the States for the past 18 years, Dallas is the latest city :)  It's hard to say which one I like living in more, Texas or Thailand. It's just very different. Overall, I like the more simplistic lifestyle and better living standards (in some ways, but not all) in the US more than Thailand.  

The living cost is quite a bit lower in Thailand and I love the food (not just Thai food, simply just so much variety) here, but some things are just frustrating, including some elements of the Thai culture.  I suggest you visit Thailand for a couple of weeks before moving here just to get the feel of it.


I think the point is, a 16” MacBook Pro weighs around 4 pounds. The point of the iPad is to be lighter/smaller than carrying a laptop around.


I almost envy the people that know you in real life; they get to be the first ones to read your obituary.


Yeah, you’re right. That’s just how it is.


While I don't see that as too much of a problem (I like the idea of popping it off and on as needed, not weighing it down while drawing), what I got kind of dissspointed by is that the second hinge doesn't go too far back. I'd hoped I could get the iPad almost parallel to the table for some of the more interesting quarantine poses (in bed, in a sofa, etc)


You can't pull a laptop screen off and use it as a tablet. This is a hybrid device. It's basically Apple's Surface, but without the full OS.


iPads are going to get full Mac OS support in some capacity soon I mean it’s gotta happen at this point


Well wheels roll so there’s that difference


Because "apple" thats why.  Apple convinces people to buy super expensive things all the time.


Yes it does as shown in one of the videos


Yep, just weighted it today, the magic keyboard is about 590 grams vs about 297 grams or so of the folio. this is for the 11"


Unfortunately he's stuck in Thailand without a scale so he can't give any numbers~


All matte screen protectors distort the screen to an extent. If they didn’t distort them, they wouldn’t be matte.


Don't worry, Samsung will copy that too.


you take it off lol


Because it floats I’m guessing. If it was like the original just with an added trackpad and better keyboard that would be great


Nope, unfortunately not :/


Because Apple. lol. I mean that’s the answer


Apple tax duh


Nope.


It’s there, just very faint


Logitech MX Keys and CREATE ftw!!


No, it uses the smart connectors on the back and requires a physical connection


What?


Yes


I intend to use mine as a laptop replacement so this is great!


Pretty sure this is the 2020 MacBook Air style keyboard.


People can claim this but there are literally zero other keyboards on the market that are magnetically attached and have a hinge that a) won't potentially damage the iPad itself, and b) will actually have a reasonable lifespan as I'm sure Apple's official model will. Those are like the two biggest selling points of this product, and it has been years yet nobody else has come up with anything that gets close on even one of those two factors, let alone both.


U can write on it I guess if you hold the keyboard side down with one hand so it doesn’t wobble too much


people already don’t like the $300 tag on this. implementing the most underused feature on the macbooks and jacking up the price would only make this worse lol


You have a giant touch sensitive display right there. Why?


They still sell both of those things, no need for snark


You are....welcome very much?


Who gives a shit


What a weird comment


I have a MBP for work. The iPad is way more fun to use as a personal device and I just use my work laptop for any heavy lifting needed


[deleted]


please put just the case on a kitchen scale. how exactly in grams does it weigh?


[deleted]


It doesn't seem like there's a way to use the pencil simultaneously like how to the fold-able cases are. In a manor that it makes a pyramid to write w the pencil. I hope that's clear. 

I'm a student, and would like to seamlessly switch between the mode you presented for out of classroom e.g. doing hw and switch to the pyramid style in class to write down notes.

Edit: Nvm, saw your video thanks for answering our questions!


that confirms it! they made it heavier so that the iPad is less likely to top over, so they made the keyboard a counterweight. thanks for confirming!


The desktop experience is kinda ruined by the USB-C not being a hub. It’d be ideal to leave it on the desk with an external monitor plugged in the Magic Keyboard as “desktop mode” and then just magnetically detach from it to just switch to “tablet mode”....


[deleted]


Think I’ll keep my knock off esr magnetic smart folio and Bluetooth keyboard and mouse  $50 combo over this. Granted, not the same thing at all, but in my use I’m happy to keep long-form typing to desk duty only.


When you take it off to use as a tablet...the keyboard just stays in your lap?


It is justifiable. Even if I wish it were cheaper. It’s the only thing like it. It’s a great backlit keyboard + one of the absolute best trackpad you could ever get, + its a front and back cover for your iPad + it adds a usb-c port + it’s an adjustable iPad stand. Plus tons of magnets to make it easily attachable/detachable, without the need of a battery/Bluetooth.  All in one.


I’m not so sure.  If it was the only option then maybe but it isn’t.

There’s the admittedly high priced smart folio keyboard and the smattering of other solutions form other vendors.

The fact the Logitech is making them for the air, 7th gen etc means there may in fact be the possibility that this format will come from other manufacturers in the future.

For me I like the flexibility that the standard 12.9 pro gives me when I add the smart folio keyboard and a Magic Trackpad.  And that’s what I think it comes down to, flexibility for the end user.


My guess on weight is it to give it more stability.  I’ve owned a Surface tab and the lack of stability was an everyday experience.  Can’t wait for mine to arrive!


Any time you use a keyboard you shouldn’t expect it to be super light as you aren’t using it like a tablet like you would holding it


Not sure what you were expecting. Take the original Smart Folio, add a backlight, stronger hinge, and more key travel. What did you think it was going to weigh?


I was expecting some comprises, but it being heavy + no book mode + $350 seems like too much.


Smartfolio + Pebble 350 + MX Keys here. Love it !


I would strongly suggest most people go a similar route - not necessarily the Magic Keyboard, but not using an integrated keyboard case. I got a Logi Slim Folio Pro only because I knew I would have to do writing on my lap (like I am now!) - if you can save your typing for flat surfaces, that frees you up to use any keyboard you like, and one that won’t become useless if you switch devices. A Magic Trackpad 2 seems like a decent pairing.


Yea. I have that combo but with a regular Microsoft mouse than a trackpad. I just put it in my backpack. 

BUT a Magic Keyboard + Folio thing won’t be bad. You can easily snap off your iPad and switch between the cases.


I have that one for like a month now. The W key is already starting to fail. Keys are pretty wobbly.

Another problem is that it's SUPER HARD to remove the iPad from the case when i feel like using it without it. Feels like i will break something everytime.


A trackpad version is probably coming soon. They have one for the air.


That one doesn’t have a track pad though


The slim folio is an amazing case, I have one for my 10.5 pro and I love it

A case that actually provides high quality device protection, keyboard with super useful function keys, it’s really an awesome case

Seeing that this new magic keyboard is probably just as heavy as the slim folio, but is so much less versatile really makes me wonder who the market for it is

Just wish Logitech had an option for this new pro, it would easily be the most popular, and in my opinion best option for a keyboard case


I had it for less than a day and returned it. I wanted to like it but I could tell after a few hours of using it that I would quickly be disappointed in its quality.


I prefer to keep a case always on, and a case also allows the iPad to sit flatly on a surface, which is nice when writing notes.


Thank you!


That’s really too bad. I use it as a writing pad a lot and being able to fold over the folio case makes it more stable because of the camera bump cutout and it protects it.


I’m so glad I found this out! I just cancelled my Amazon pre-order of the magic keyboard and got the regular folio keyboard instead. While I was kind of looking forward to experimenting with the trackpad, the lack of a “book mode” is a complete dealbreaker for me. I can live with the folio keyboard until some really good third-party option comes along. Such a shame…


Damn. The more I hear about this keyboard the less interested I am. I’m happy with the iPad I have with the Folio. Much better for my needs.


Thank you! I'm glad I could help answer some of the questions! Stay safe!


The Logitech folio keyboard case on my 9.7" pro was good, but eventually the plastic around the speaker holes got weak (even though I never took the ipad out) and the case became loose. Sugru helped for a little while, but failed quickly after.


Could they? Like legally? I would think Apple has some kind of rule that third parties can’t take advantage of the magnets or they would get sued. Sounds really dumb but I haven’t seen a lot of 3rd parties take advantage of the magnets. Took me about an hour on Amazon to find a seller that did.


15% *


300 $ for 11-inch 350 for 12


The price will drop? Hahaha

Apple *never* drops their price, and they never do sales


it does look fancy af but I just cannot justify buying this one. I'm leaning towards the regular smart keyboard as I'm getting my first 4th gen soon


They might click anywhere also but the more top you click the stiffer it gets.


Oh no. But I still want a case when I’m laying it flat, because the table might scratch the bare tablet or something like that. It doesn’t make it portable then.


Yep. While I didn't really "mind" the smart keyboard there is no doubt that I like my MBP keyboard much better. The real switches in this board are going to be a huge upgrade for me. What I love about working from the ipad is that it is 0 distractions. I have the app I'm using and only whatever else I choose to be on the screen. That is huge for me. So I'm pretty excited.


I wouldn’t say “any”, sadly

My 1st gen Magic Trackpad does not support tap to click :/


Where do you set that? I was looking for it to change it on my magic track pad 2


fwiw id take a 12.9 folio off yr hands. no way i can afford this anytime soon.


Send it over lmfao


Hmm okay. You have a good point. I didnt realize that there would be no functionality with a force touch trackpad. 

But maybe a force touch trackpad would allow a thinner keyboard than a mechanical one. It would also allow iPadOS updates to take advantage of force touch functionality. After all, iPadOS was supposed to be different from iOS... right? Then $300 or $350 would be worth it. 

Also disappointing that the USB-C pass through is only a charging port.


[deleted]


Because it feels better and the press and feedback can be modified.


This is a $300 keyboard we’re talking about here.


I’m siding with you on this one. I have the Magic Trackpad 2 as well, and I don’t care that this case won’t have it. I use Tap to Click anyway.


We always gotta complain about something. Even when apple gives us what we want


We can praise the update while bashing the keyboard product.


force touch trackpads are much much better than any other trackpads, even those Apple made in the past.


No scale could measure the hardness I get looking at this keyboard


I wish it folded all the way around too. Maybe in a future revision.


It may damage the keys and trackpad. Get a skin or just pop it off and rest the iPad on the folded cover


I think the point is that when it’s in the keyboard, it’s meant to be on a desk. And when you’re holding it you can just pull it off the keyboard and use it as a tablet. Can’t do that with a MacBook


I don’t envy anyone who complains about carrying 3 pounds!


The whole point of iPadOS is to NOT do that


this has magic in its title. so that’s the markup.


Damn that does suck. I already have the keyboard folio which does. Hard to give that up for £300.00. This keyboard looks amazing but I don’t really want to have to swap it out for another one when I’m travelling and want to draw etc when I’m on a train or something.


I see it now. Thanks!


All right. Thanks!


I’m aware. I’m just sharing that It’s precursor was one of Apple’s few fails and an awful waste of money. People should know that going in.


if it’s made of the same crap the keyboard folio is, the lifespan will be crap. those thing peel after about a year plus. So the second point doesn’t even apply to apple.

The magnetic connection is true, but this is the first ipad keyboard from apple with a hinge, so there is no proof it holds up yet.


That’s how Apple gets us. incrementally,  $300 may seem a lot now.. but down the line $400 now with a Touch Bar.. it will be totally worth it. /s


Yea but u expect us to reach all the way up there and touch it?! What are we ,peasants?


No one necessarily but that’s what I decided to comment and I don’t think it’s against the subreddit rules.


He put a second video up on YouTube recently

You can do in the settings, and it also adjusts automatically using the iPads light sensor


yes, through the settings in iPad OS. Additionally, it adjusts automatically based on the ambient light sensor on the iPad. check out this video: https://youtu.be/2vmGgZkFK40


I'm stuck in Thailand (and hence why I got it earlier), but I don't have a kitchen scale here... I do have one back home in Dallas though, but that won't help haha


Staggered that no one has done this yet. Honestly.


It is the same rubbery/plasticky as the smart folio unfortunately. I won't hold up well.


I would buy it in a hard beat if it was leather


That's a cool idea! If I had this setup I'd probably just use an external keyboard and trackpad combo. 

You could also just plug the USB C monitor adapter into the iPad instead of the keyboard. One extra step to plug/unplug the cable from the iPad.


Except you aren’t going to take off the keyboard and throw a naked iPad into a bag and go to a coffee shop. Most will want some sort of case. Hell, the iPad is almost designed with using a case in my with the camera bump.

I get what people are saying, but the fact is the case is on almost always for most people.


I don’t intend to buy one as I’m quite well set as it stands but the second usb c port would be the main draw for me.

I look at my smart folio keyboard and wish there was one on there....but then I think its heavy enough as it is.


Yes, I also think its for stability reasons. But for me that doesnt match to the iPads concept.


I want it to be as light as possible in my bag.


The weight plus the cost is what leaves me thinking getting a MacBook would be the smarter decision.


What’s book mode?


Ah darn it. Was thinking of getting one for my iPad Pro. Is it still covered under warranty and do you think the Magic Keyboard is better based on the reviewers video?


My Logitech Keyboard also sucked after about a month. Sometimes, the keys work, sometimes they just don’t. I have issues with the A and the space bar. I have babied it yet the number 8 fell off and it’s just cheaply made to me...


I don't think there's going to be one in the next months: Apple allowed Logitech to use the smart connector interface on non-iPad-Pro models, and also decided not to make a first-party one with trackpad. Almost seems like it's gonna be Apple for the high-end device and Logitech for the lower-end


damn I'm seeing a consensus here. What keyboard are you using now or will you be buying the magic keyboard case?


That kind of defeats the entire purpose of the case though.  The whole point is that you can easily pick it up and remove it for that kind of use, without all of the bulk.


[deleted]


I’m sure there’s at least a license they’d have to pay for a “Made for iPad” designation to use the Smart Connector. Logi made a SmartConnector keyboard for the first iPad Pros (where it was on the margin edge of the device... I’m sure this would require a new license, if Apple would allow it at all. They like control of their propriety... 

Logitech’s Folio keyboard for the iPad Pro 12.9 was a great device, but a bulky mother...


https://images.app.goo.gl/LXgzgPzUve2ctrmp7


400 cad and he got it for 300cad so 25% off, I think accessories are priced 25% off and also they get one discount a year for everything I think.


OH FFS.


Correct. The price won’t drop.


Best Buy does though 😏


I guess that’s why I got my 16” mbp for $300 less than their released price. 

Or my iPad Pro 11” for $100 off. But they never drop their prices - sales happen.


This. This is exactly my problem with the stand. I'm a student and take handwritten notes a lot so this might be a dealbreaker. Thinking about getting the regular folio and a Logitech pebble. Thoughts?


There is a thin case you can buy which is compatible with the keyboard!


oomph. 

yeah you’re right. They screwed that one over.


Settings —> General —> trackpad

Then tap to click should be an option switch


>	But maybe a force touch trackpad would allow a thinner keyboard than a mechanical one. It would also allow iPadOS updates to take advantage of force touch functionality.

Might be thinner, but it would be heavier. And Apple has removed 3D Touch from the iPhone line, so strategically they’ll be unlikely to want to add it back to iPad. Force touch is hard to discover and really imprecise - kind of a failed experiment IMHO.

>	Also disappointing that the USB-C pass through is only a charging port.

That’s probably a technical limitation of the smart connector. You can’t do high speed USB 3.1 with only three pins.

>	Then $300 or $350 would be worth it.

Yes, this is the nub of the argument - it’s crazy expensive. For me, additional features wouldn’t further justify that price. It is superbly engineered, but it is still just a keyboard and trackpad.

This is one for the market - if they sell well then we’ll know Apple has pitched it right. If they don’t then they’ll either have to drop the price or discontinue it.


No it's both. You need software to interpret the force of touch and act accordingly


But you need vibration motors for that. How would you fit those into this thin keyboard?
Plus, the real use for the force touch trackpads is that it can read different kinds of pressure. Apple is obviously getting rid of that feature on mobile devices (the newest iPhones don’t have it anymore), therefore, only „Haptic Touch“ would be reasonable and that, too, needs vibration motors.


seriously lol. Expecting all the bells and whistles is completely justified at that price point


That's not just keyboard. That's like saying iPhones are just phones.

It’s a great backlit keyboard + one of the absolute best trackpad you could ever get, + its a front and back cover for your iPad + it adds a usb-c port + it’s an adjustable iPad stand. Plus tons of magnets to make it easily attachable/detachable, without the need of a battery/Bluetooth. All in one.


I’m ded


iPadOS is basically still iOS. Think of something like Dex but a version of MacOS that iPads can boot into when needed


Yeah, agreed. However I do find that even with my smart folio (not keyboard) I take it off because I don't like the added weight. I imagine I'll keep the keyboard next to the iPad in my bag. I'll use both when I'm at a desk but will still be able to pull out just the iPad when I want to.


I’m not saying the keyboard wasn’t terrible, it really was. But as someone that really likes the keyboard on his Mac as well as the ones from my older MacBooks I don’t think I’ll have any problem with this one.


Well, I have to say I disagree. I've owned the Apple keyboard folio for the 11" Pro since release week, so nearly 1.5 years at this point - and it goes absolutely everywhere with me and gets constant use during most of my waking hours. The case is in perfectly decent condition.

As a general rule Apple makes their products - especially mechanical parts - to much higher standards than the third party companies who tend to make the accessories. I have high confidence.


[deleted]


This was so helpful, thank you. Now to wait and see someone with the 12.9” lol this really answered a lions share of my questions though.


Thanks for the video! What screen protector are you using on your iPad?


Someone ship this man a scale!


You guys have Apple store in Thailand?


[deleted]


I’ve had mine since day 1 and not even a scuff. It’s used as my primary design machine. It’s all in how you treat them


That is why they added the USB-C port to the keyboard. So you can charge the iPad while using the iPad USB-C for accessories.


That's not the point. Of course the keyboard will be attached when you throw it in your bag - but throughout the day - as you actually use it - on the couch, in the kitchen, in bed, at work, at a coffee shop, etc, the iPad is far more versatile in how you use it - and this keyboard only extends that versatility further. 

If this were a true case like most other manufacturers make, which is difficult to put on and off, I'd see your point, but with Apple's magnetic case system, it takes only a second to put it in or take it out. I switch between the current keyboard case and using it bare more times than I can count in a given day.


In one of the review videos it shows that you can use the keyboard with a case, this would be the ideal scenario for me as I like taking my MBA everywhere but sometimes don't need the full bulk, this would fit the space in between perfectly.


I have my iPad naked all the time and so does literally everyone I know


I don’t mind the weight tbh. Weight is only important when carried/used in hand right? So since it can’t even fold back you have to pull it out of the MK anyway. And when you’re using the MK, it’s either on your lap or on a table, and in that case weight doesn’t matter.


When the keyboard is folded to the back of the iPad/folded 360°.
Basically Tablet mode.


Yep, i'm sending mine back for repair/replacement, but i already regret buying it, specially considering how expensive it costs here in Brazil (4/5 of a monthly minimum wage).

The new one looks better, specially on how easy it looks to remove the iPad from it. The only thing i deslike is the camera hole when using a 2018 iPad Pro.


i've got one for almost 2 months now and everything is still solid on mine. removing the ipad doesn't break anything. love the typing experience, the extra row of function keys and the battery, which i haven't charged once since it was delivered.


Good point. I hope you’re wrong, even though I wouldn’t buy the Logitech keyboard since I remove my ipad from so often that the Logitech case would be annoying.


I have a k811 Logitech keyboard in my bag for now. I have a magic keyboard on order.


When I use it as a writing pad, it sits on a desk, counter, etc. How would the added ability to bend it over defeat any purpose?


Well I’d rather not have my iPad naked in the moment where it could be dropped the easiest (writing something with the pencil when I take it out)


There is no (or very slight) magnetic force on the back of the case, so it would not hold the iPad.


For real. no wonder apple's ROE is over 50% lmao .


With tax, almost $380... GTFO


Nobody was talking about the core product...


I'll just pop the iPad off the case, close the case and place the iPad on that. If that becomes annoying then I'll buy a skin.


Where?


I never used 3D touch... but i was talking about force touch from a mac user perspective. To my knowledge, i thought the new mac lineups were thinner due to the force touch trackpad. This was because mechanical clicks take up more space than the force touch, because you save more space where a physical mechanical click would happen. Tbh i never use force touch functions on my mac... but the feel and confidence i have with the trackpad that it will never break or get mechanically stuck with debris or dust is good. My pre 2018-macbook air with mechanical trackpad always got stuck due to that. Considering ipad is a much more “mobile” device, imo a force touch trackpad would be nice.  

Understandable that USB C doesn’t have enough bandwidth through 3 pin connector... thanks for pointing that out

This is Apple’s “i think Microsoft was right” moment with the two in one tablet game. Yes, we’ll see how market goes. Im a student developer, and i only use my ipad for reading/taking notes and viewing slides. I cant code on it or access terminal commands, so i will have no “pro” use for it. It’s not pro enough for me by my standards, but we’ll see how pro it is for others.

-	it’s a run of the mill keyboard and probably no better than a Surface Pro keyboard
-	it has a tiny trackpad
-	yep, the existing iPad keyboard doubles as a protective cover. Life-changing stuff
-	the usb-c port is charging only and I seriously doubt it can deliver 18W through those pins
-	magical magnets?


Yeah this is true. Maybe I will ditch the smart folio keyboard and get the magic keyboard. I have the normal folio so could keep that on when not using the magic keyboard. Such a shame still that it can’t be used with the keyboard behind.


you don’t have to agree. it’s already happened to others. 

This is the same company that game us the failing butterfly keyboard for 4 years straight. Come on man. I’m not giving any benefit of the doubt here for $300+


No worries, glad I could help

Ordered my first iPad and the magic keyboard the other day so I’m sat refreshing pages to scratch the itch until I get mine haha


We do, just one currently, but it's closed due to Covid.


I was kinda hoping the smart keyboard folio would hold up well. Does the keyboard still look decent after heavy use on the Smart Keyboard folio?


Mine had to be replaced because the plastic peels away from the edges, particularly around the camera hole. I hope they’ve improved the plastic adhesive because replacing such an expensive keyboard for cosmetic issues again will suck.

Just to add, I treat it with extreme care - the materials are shoddy, no question.


Doubt. Your telling me this can connect to a usb c dock for charging and data delivery? I highly doubt that.


I would contend that this case reduces versatility. To do anything other than laptop mode, you have to ditch the case. You can use it portrait. You can’t use it as just a tablet. You can’t use the Pencil (reasonably). 

Taking it out of the case would mean I have to find a place for the case. So in a plane, at a coffee shop, small library desk, etc that means putting in the floor, taking up valuable desk space, throwing it a bag, etc. It really feels like another case of having to alter your habits and go out of your way to turn the iPad into something it’s not.


Like most Apple products, I don’t think it’s gonna offer protection for the entire iPad. It seems to leave the edges open. I understand why, it makes it easier to take the iPad off and it needs to charge the Pencil, but it wouldn’t be my choice to use this keyboard as protection instead of a case. For people like me this keyboard is useless, so I understand the comments. However, I knew that from the start since none of the iPad Pro (keyboard) cases offered full protection before and they’re (logically) not compatible with cases. So I will always skip them. I can see the point of using it for people who don’t mind a caseless iPad. It seems like a nice keyboard. I’m not sure about the trackpad, but I’m used to a huge Magic Trackpad 2 and I get that they couldn’t fit that on this case, lol. The space just isn’t there. I’m curious if the trackpad feels better than it looks though. I find the price tag for keyboard a bit steep but if you see what it offers (keyboard, trackpad, stand and ‘case’) it’s not that different from their usual prices for devices and accessories. I was curious about the hype so it’s cool to have seen it in action now.


This case: https://www.switcheasy.com/Coverbuddy201911.php


Erg, I was afraid you’d say that. I have one arriving this week but just assumed it would do that! Guess I’ll try it for a week or so and see how it fits in my workflow.


I don't really use the iPad in "book mode", so I guess removing the keyboard fast and getting rid of that extra weight in tablet mode does make sense, at least to me.

Still I wish they included a very slim silicone case with cutouts for the smart connector, that combination would be great for me.


Any issue with your k811? I love the fact that its backlit but the frequent recharging is taxing and with micro usb of all things..


The iPad was designed to be ultralight.  Ultraportable.  So you get this beautiful device designed to be this light, portable, powerful machine and then slap a case on it and essentially turn it into a laptop, except with less power, and a mobile OS.   I dunno, it seems to defeat the original  overall purpose of what the iPad was designed to be.


At that point buy Apple stock it’ll probably go up faster than the keyboard depreciates


You make a good point though. The original keyboard cover hasn’t dropped at all yet.


Cover buddy by smart easy i have just ordered one this morning for my 12.9.

[https://www.switcheasy.com/Coverbuddy201912.php](https://www.switcheasy.com/Coverbuddy201912.php)

i use thew smart folio but alos use the ipad without a case so thout would give this a go as it protects the back and sides


It’s definitely ok for people to value different things, but when we are subject to the same premium price point, people definitely have to right to complain. It’s not like we have different tiers of trackpad enabled keyboards to choose directly from Apple.


Logitech released a few years ago a stand with charging through the smart connector, and it could deliver up to 12W (but actually even less due to the limitations of the smart connector). 

My guess is there hasn't been really an upgrade in terms of power delivery of the smart connector, so the port on the keyboard is going to be a "mantain charge level" thing. A bit disappointed honestly.


Yeah it is~ I think mostly this is a case of apple thinking of it as a completely different product than people did. 

It seems to be an insane product, but just not quite what people wanted it to be~


To be fair, the keyboards were only failing for some, and got better with each revision.

Not the keyboard, you use that to charge your iPad, you use the iPad usb-c for everything else


Feels like you are reaching here. So I have to leave it on a table, tuck it into the magazine pocket, or god forbid, put it back in the bag I pulled it out of?

The existing keyboard case, which I've lived with for the last year and a half is fine - it's the best case/keyboard combination I've used in owning iPads for 10 years, but without a trackpad, the iPad has always been really marginal to do even basic office tasks. This will fundamentally change things because when I use it as a tablet, I don't want any case attached - yet it should greatly improve the iPad's function as a computer replacement. That's hardly a downside.


Book mode = take it off. No need to lug a keyboard around with you.


Not really. Except with homeschool my kids all have iPads and are fighting over it. 

Seems to hold a charge for three or four weeks of regular use.


Nothing is gospel. 

I’m still curious how, all other things being equal, adding the ability to fold it back for use while sitting on a desk defeats any purpose.


It really sucks too because third party brands of the same type of product do go on sale

Like, Logitech’s iPad keyboards go on sale all the time. You can’t tell me that Apple sells there products at the lowest price they possibly can and that’s why they don’t do sales.. it’s just greed and a captured market


Will you have to remove the iPad to use the magic keyboard magnets reliably?


Agree completely it’s more a keyboard than it is a case with a keyboard I guess. It’s a great bit of kit. I just have to decide if I’m going to throw down the cash for one.


it was far more than for “some.”

It really isn’t an issue that is able to be downplayed. They completely dropped the keys one the newest models. It was a large scale failure.


Yeah, surprised by the lack of adjustability but I’d prefer a stable stand than an extra 20 degrees or whatever, I’ll only be using it for basic office work anyway

I think this will end up acting as a glorified dock that stays at my desk if I’m honest, can’t see me using it as a case unless I’m on a business call. Here’s hoping ours come a few days early too!


Oh fair.. yeah you're right that would work.


>The existing keyboard case, which I've lived with for the last year and a half is fine

The existing case allows the iPad to be quite a bit more versatile as you can put the keyboard on the back and use the tablet as a tablet and still have a case on it, this does not allow for that.


But then there’s no protection or stand if you want to set it down.


it doesn’t. People are doing mental gymnastics to explain the shortcomings as intentional features lol


[deleted]


I mean, should I copy and paste the same thing I just said? I literally just answered this.


Not sure it’s a captured market but it certainly is a boutique brand that puts a premium on its its product.


Last I knew, there weren't any hard numbers on how many had issues vs. how many didn't, so we really don't know how widespread the issue is/was. Some people absolutely had issues though. Not disputing that at all.


I mean, I use mine that way plenty - but I don't really see that as fundamentally changing what the device can do the way adding a trackpad will. It's simply a way that I sometimes happen to hold it. More often than not though I find myself taking the iPad out when holding it because the only thing the keyboard case does is add weight at that point.


Exactly, and that is the reason I canceled mine.


Don’t do that then. It could have a notch for the proper laptop position and then fold all the way around.

I get the engineering challenges. This tangent is because another redditer thinks having the ability to fold back would be a negative all by itself.


Maybe if you answered the question instead of being a blind fanboy? How does added extra usability hurt anything? The ability fold it back was a feature in the previous keyboard that allowed it to be a case and a keyboard in one, this costs twice as much and removes one of the benefits.


It led to them making an permanent extended warranty problem solely for the keyboard of those models what had it because they failed on people so much.

Based on that alone, safe the say the numbers were pretty high.


>the only thing the keyboard case does is add weight at that point.

And protection....


[deleted]


I literally answered the question two comments up, and for the record you seem to be having an imaginary debate here.   Your referencing me as a fanboy makes me think that maybe I'm not explaining my point properly.  

At this point you can just scroll up to read the conversation.   Having the case fold back upon itself for tablet mode doesn't make any sense at all since the iPad doesn't actually lock into the case.  It just slips right on/off, so why would you bother using the iPad in tablet mode with all of that additional weight, girth, and battery drain?  It defeats the purpose of the design.   Did you guys even watch the video?


I feel it's dumber that i can't use the apple watch with the ipad, forcing me to buy an iphone, because...

Apple Watch is a pretty capable independent device, i should be able to choose to go around with only the watch and come back to my home dashboard(on ipad) to check my daily activity.


Only possible with the power of the M4 chip


Sooo stupid especially as a lot of students use iPads, 3rd party apps suck.


They can't shrink an iPad down that small, silly


It took them 12 years to put the weather app on the iPad. We need to be patient.


lol. The interview with iOS guy on his reasoning is the only thing stupider.


I spent an embarrassing amount of time searching for “calculator” and going through my apps when I first got my iPad 🤦‍♀️


When MKBHD asked Craig about this his response was absolutely ridiculous. It showed how flawed Apple’s corporate thinking can be sometimes.

He basically said they didn’t do it because they wanted to be able to do something different and really great with the calculator app’s design on the iPad. And since they couldn’t come up with anything distinctly better they just never got around to ever making one. Seriously such an unsatisfying reason.


There hasn’t been an iPad made that has the processing power 
Be reasonable


Apple knows we just wouldn’t be able to handle all 10.5 inches of a calculator. It’s for our own good


The reason is probably down to history, since Steve didn't like it


At this point in time, I genuinely believe that the lack of iPad calculator app is some kind of weird power play from the Apple devs.


Dumbest thing Apple has done is to ship their most popular education product without a calculator app. Oversight is amazing.


This video may help.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK\_AtW66XI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK_AtW66XI0)


It needs M3 silicon to be able the calculations on the iPad, just give it a few more years.


thats hilarious actually


I personally use [Calculator Plus v2](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1181465428) as my calculator app of choice. It works on all the Apple devices (iPad, iPhone, Mac, Watch) and it works really well for more advanced equations.


They have no reason to not add the Calculator anymore, especially that Stage Manager handles window sizing. The full-size Calculator iPad app should show all functions of the calculator, simplified when window is small.


Omg yes!!!!!!! Why would they think we wouldn’t want a calculator on the ipad?  I’m also annoyed that soulver is only on ipad and not iPhone.


They don’t want to do that, obviously


Apple is full of lazy morons and I’m getting sick and tired of their BS , they need to give feature parity across devices and regions across the world . If you don’t know Apple Maps doesn’t even give point to point directions in most of the Middle East and South Asia or even share my location. The literal minimum for a map app to be useful.

Also when the hell if my iPad gone get optimized battery charging. Macs have it, iPhones have it … r/applesucks


You definitely got the point


It’s not about the ability to do it but the reluctance.


You’d think that apple would have an entire graphing calculator app native on the iPad.


[deleted]


Ipads don't have calculators?? Lmao.


Calculator Infinty that’s the best, used it all throughout college for calculus, physics, and chem


*won't put it on an iPad


Meh, I just use Siri to do my calculation.


Same sentiments I have about multiple timers on the Apple Watch, versus no multiple timers for the iPhone.... (I've gotten used to just using my Google Home to do them when I'm cooking)


Yeah it pisses me off


I think you meant to say say just how stupid apple is in general. They do bare minimum to make sure they cash their check.


They say it’s because of “the aesthetics”, but you know what’s not very aesthetic? Using a janky ad-riddled calculator app because Apple won’t make a simple thing.


You want them to shrink it and put it on the iPad ? Right away !!


WORD!!!


I was randomly recommended this post by Reddit and I don’t have an iPad but I have to agree … how the heck does an iPad not come with a calculator app?!


It’s infuriating that they haven’t added a calculator to iPad yet! How did they not add it on the first one? It’s such a basic, simple and expected app on devices like this. Incredible.


Strongly suspect the absence of a Calculator app is a kind of unspoken memorial/tribute to Steve Jobs. Jobs pulled a lazy port of the iPhone Calculator to the iPad right before its release.  


Jobs was in failing health at the time. My guess is that they didn't want to bother him with something so trivial, and something that they knew he had very strong feelings about ([going back to the Calculator on the original Macs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK_AtW66XI0)).  


Jobs resigned from Apple about 7 months after the release of the iPad. And I'm guessing they didn't want to touch it while he was terminally ill. He died a little over a year after his resignation. By that time, the iPad had been without a Calculator app for nearly 2 years because of Jobs. They probably decided to just leave this missing piece as he left it.


Steve screamed at the person who just wanted to port vanilla Calculator to the iPad so no one ever touched it again.


Seriously. The first time I tried to open calculator on my iPad Pro, I was in shock that it just didn’t exist & I had to download a 3rd party calculator app 🤣


Literally impossible to make it work on iPad. The device just isn’t strong enough to do those complex calculations


I use spotlight/search on my iPad and Macs to do calculations. I barely open the calculator app.


exactly


I think the story is that Steve Jobs thought just blowing up the calculator to an ipad screen looked stupid, and implored them to find a better way. And the can has been getting kicked for over 10 years now.


Isn’t that just a strange way Apple is “honoring” Steve Jobs because he once said there will never be an official calculator app on the iPad?

Same reason MacBooks will never get touch screen and iPhones will never get a stylus.


I recommend the third party app „Solves“ as a replacement.
No Ads, no Lag, no In App Purchases and completely free!
Looks very similar to the stock one as well!


It takes 1 min to download a calculator from the store.


Apple sneaky since day 1. Steve Jobs sneaky with woz therefore Tim Cook gotta play Steve Jobs, sneaky part 2 profit reigns


I've only used ipad 1, they still haven't put it on after over 13 years???!


Making the calculator a paid app on ipads was probably one of apple's most unfathomable moments.


Don’t you also have an iPhone for that since you have an Apple Watch? Or better yet, a graphing calculator from grade school or university?


For a free version, I would recommend Uno Calc. It is free.  


https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/uno-calculator/id1464736591?l=fr


It would limit the marketshare for the currently in-development, new genre of devices called 'Smart Calcs'. 

Introducing the always on, always connected, always calculating, iCalc. Available in 6 colors and two sizes. Be consistently up to date with the latest in calculation technology. 

They've taken the paper tape to the paper trail. Never miss a mistake! 

TPS reports are a thing of the past with auto-TPS reporting.

Share your calculation session with other fellow iCalculators in real time.

Send your best calculations in for a shot at winning the 'iCalc of the day'.

Or compete with others in a variety of calculation-based games.

Defy reality and logic with 'AnyCalcGoes' mode; where, you guessed it, any calculation can equal anything of your chosing! (AnyCalcGoes calcs cannot be submitted to iCalc of the Day; unless the user is subscribed to iCalcUnlimited)

So. Its not stupid.


Apple is just stupid period. You buy this brand if you have the money for it, anybody touting this brands is making good stuff is just a playing mental gymnastics to justify spending on luxury. Apple is a luxury company first and foremost.


Just use iPad search. You can enter equations.


I don’t understand — you want an iPad you buy an iPad. You want a calculator you have at least 7 choices:
- buy a calculator (10 cents at my local thrift store)
- get a free calculator app for your iPad
- buy a calculator app for your iPad (I use MaxiCalc Pro - $1.99 (for which I get to use it on three iPads, plus family sharing), but they also have a free version)
- buy an Apple Watch and use the included calculator app
- buy an iPhone and use the included calculator app
- use the calculator you already have on your PC
- use pencil/pen & paper

I too hate that Apple is too stingy to include a calculator app on the iPad (regardless of the history, that is the only valid reason now). But honestly there has been more time spent about the hate on this issue, that could have been more productively spent getting a real solution for iPad on a real problem, where there aren’t already other choices today.


You cave a calculator, it’s called [Spotlight](https://i.imgur.com/aOAozos.jpg), it’s been there for years, you can type arbitrary equations into it. How do people still not know this.


Failed company


I paid a dollar and bought one.


It make more sense on a watch than a big iPad screen question do you use calculator on full screen on pc ? Non ? Yeah because it’s pointless


Solved: Save this link as an icon to your iPad desktop. https://www.calculator.net/sitemap.html


If they just scale it to fit the iPad screen, I think it looks terrible and goofy. They could however make it as a widget, maybe even a collapsible widget which would look mounds better


You can calculate in the search bar.


Download a free app.   We should be blessed to have these “issues”


They just don’t want to, how come you didn’t get this yet? Just download a third party app lol


Isn’t it dumb that most people don’t know they can use spotlight for basic maths without even opening an app.


Cry about it


Anyone find it stupid that this same conversation pops up every couple weeks when there are perfectly good alternatives in the App Store?


Sell your Apple Watch and quit whining


they can remove features to make it smaller for the watch. but there is no additional stuff to make it with it as a big ipad app so they didn't


Nope. Don’t find it annoying at all. They could slap a calculator on the iPad easily, they choose not too.

I’m way more annoyed by y’all complaining about it all the time. 😖

Want an iPad calculator app? Download one of the many free options from the App Store. Call it a day.


Used to be on the iPad and it only displayed at the same dimensions as an iPhone


I saw that it’s a thing with Apple not wanting to go against Steve Jobs’ first iPad


Because Phteve‘s last will: „Hear me out Tim!“ *caugh* *caugh* „Promise… that you will never puuut proper calculator on the iPad“ *caugh* *dies*


Because they’ve set themselves up now, after jobs made them pull it for not being amazing enough it needs to be “wow”, and how do you wow a calculator?

Especially stupid now with multitasking you can have it floating off one side of the screen.


I was this years old when I realized Apple Watch had a calculator


I find it weird that Apple can't put vertical dual app function on iPad... Specially important on iPad Mini, a device that people use mainly one-handed vertically. I just want to watch all the different video apps on top + other useful apps at the bottom. This work so smoothly on Android, so it's time to wake up and update this.


I think no one else


Hopefully they fix this with iPadOS 17. In the meantime, I find this app very helpful: https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/uno-calculator/id1464736591


I know it’s really stupid more iPad user need calculator especial for student :d math class


I always assumed Apple lacked the technology to enlarge the calculator


So annoying. Every time I’m on my iPad and need a calculator. I use google cause I always miss press something on my watch and have to restart over. Or I just use Siri


That's apple


Damn it. I wasn’t pissed about this until now!


GraphNcalc83


The technology is not there yet /s


It’s them doing something stupid on purpose so that people talk about it and think about it.

Same reason the deliberately made the AirPods Max case completely stupid


Why would you need it on your iPad when you should just get a watch that has it /s


Here is [a webapp](https://lake-e.github.io/iPad-Calculator/index.html) that you can make into a homescreen bookmark. It mimics the Apple calculator. To enable keyboard clicks you have to click on AC twice to go into settings and then look below ”Beta features”.


I remember one of the execs addressed this during an Apple product announcement keynote or something... he said something like, "the reason why we haven't put a calculator on the iPad is that we won't do anything that isn't amazing, and we haven't yet figured out how to make an iPad calculator *amazing*!"


Wait, I pads don't have calculators?


Yes, and they just hide behind, "if we're gonna make a calculator it's gonna be the best calculator on the planet" just put a fucking calculator in the iPad Apple, what the fuck.


I just press cmd space and put in my equation in the search bar but yeah I didn’t even know Apple Watch had a calculator


listen, apple is working on it 🙄 obviously it takes time to perfect such an application that apple has dedicated an entire team to it for the past decade. trust the process man


I haven’t laughed out loud to post in a while , thank you 😂


But they’ll sell it to you for the iPad.  😂


Yes


I’ve been using PCalc for so long across all of my Apple devices that I didn’t even notice Apple’s lack of a default app on the iPad.


Guarantee they did it to spite us


I have been using Soulver on my Mac and the developers just launched it on the iPad.  It far exceeds any calculator I have ever used.


You can use the spotlight search for calculations


Just apple being apple


Just type this in the console:

sudo appstore install calculator


I always thought having the calculator on the watch was an acknowledgement of the calculator watches popular in the 1980s. Casio and other brands made them and you could get one for $30 at Radio Shack, Circuit City, or Target.


When I saw the watch calculator... I already knew the post was going to be about the iPad. Because Apple is selectively smart or dumb. Your choice. What they aren't is "helpful" in this regard. I'm a lifelong Apple fan since the Apple \]\[ C. I've never owned a PC. Apple's weird blind spots and "business-y" moves leave a lot to be desired.


Welcome to the apple logic. I can't say why it is built for the watch but for the iPad I also saw I think an interview of a YouTuber with Tim Cook. Either way, the reasoning is something like, if you can't make it special or the best possible way of doing it, just don't do it. And they didn't/don't know how to make it special. Then you might think why is it on iPhone or watch, partially because of the change in use case they see for iPad users ve iPhone users. It is not that they can't make an ipad version. That is easy enough for them more so while they already have a iPhone version. If you don't want such issues you could consider Android or non apple products in the future.


Because scam, obviously.


I have a full screen calculator on my iPad.


TI-84 >>>


Yeah. Guess they’re like. Yeah. Don’t count on it. 🙃


That's because Apple is a clown company


Who cares, download one


Wait… there’s STILL no calculator on the iPad? What the fuck?

What? There is a calculator on the iPad. Just downloaded it yesterday onto my iPad Pro.


And the reason they give for it is even more stupid


Why use default calculator with no history if there's Solves or other apps better?


Yes


Surely you can just download an app for one? Probably better too ..


wait, the ipad doesn't have a built in calculator?

I have never understood why there isn’t a calculator on the iPad. . .


I would love an iPad calculator that has a good widget and works with the keyboard.


I want to know why in the world apple will not allow their phones to schedule sending a text message.  You can schedule sending an email but not text.  Android has had this capability for 10 years now


I am on my 3rd iPad and it really pisses me off that they cannot provide the calculator on it. I agree all the 3rd party calc apps suck for one you need to pay in order to get rid of the annoying ads.


But it would look really stupid if they stunk it like that and put it on the iPad.


I remember when the Apple Watch launched and they made a big deal about how no one wants to tap on the screen with their big ass fingers. So they introduced the Digital Crown to give a better way to interact with apps. See how far we’ve come since then 😜


beating a dead horse. use your phone? i dont get all this crying over an ipad calculator. ipad can do SO much more but omg no calculator \*cry cry\*


Only here because Reddit suggested this post

Nice to see Apple still making questionable decisions on user experience

Back to my Androids I go


Can't have their customers figuring out exactly how much they're paying.


It annoys me so much that there's no calculator on the iPad. I need it!


#wont, you misspelled won’t. Apple ***won’t*** put it on the iPad


"I P A D  I S  B I G" \~Steve Jobs, modified


doubly infuriating that the calculator app on the watch is far more useful to me than the one on the iphone. The tipping function on the watch calculator app is extremely useful in my day to day. I'll probably never need to use any of the extended functions on the iphone app


Apple is losing it's touch.


You will hurt yourself asking why Apple does things.


Not really, remember calculator watches?


Well they say that they’d want to do something special for the iPad. Just sizing it up is not the apple way. I’d love for them to make it more capable so you can type in entire formulas etc.


There’s no calculator on an iPad???????


Calm down guys Apple is gonna make a calculator for the iPad which will calculate your taxes that's the next innovation


You won't get anywhere trying to make sense out of Apple's decisions. Here's one: Why does the red X button on any application in MacOS minimize the application rather than close it when there's already a minimize button? All of their products are littered with strange decisions like this. Just use it and stop thinking about it or switch to Android/Windows.


What’s the point in just blowing up the interface for the iPad? If you are going to bring the app to iPad it needs to offer something that makes sense for it to be on iPad. Not just a bigger interface.


welcome to ✨apple✨


You can get the NumWorks calculator for free. Better than a TI and does everything you need. You can also buy an actual calculator that run the same calc os. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/numworks-graphing-calculator/id1456585807


Putting it on an iPad would require them to make it BIGGER. That’s an entirely different process.


I have been using Apple products for years and I’ve never realised my iPad doesn’t have a calculator


Then stop using apple products and get something that suits your needs. The circlejerking of how much better apple is over android is baffling.


I think they do it for the memes


Or how the AW has optimised battery charging but not the iPad which is much more powerful


What am I not getting - I have a calculator on my iPad Mini 5……


I have the exact same calculator on my ipad


They're making money on calculator app sales. Why spend even a dollar making a new app just to end that income?


The app “solves” is better anyway


[best calculator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solves/id1394359548)


They purposely hold the iPad back so much that it makes me not even want one anymore.


The ipad 2 I had in middle school had the calculator app it didn’t look like a third party app maybe they included it as part of the contract between apple and the school district


Steve Jobs said no, si they didn’t put it on the iPad


I have found that this app is a perfect alternative: https://apps.apple.com/app/id1394359548


They just need to learn ENGORGIO


You can’t rush perfection


Yeah, I thought it was very dumb.

Desmos is where it's at though. Get their scientific and graphing calculator apps.


They are very good at making things smaller… so-so at making things bigger


Doesn’t it just fit to the screen size or if this bad sarcasm?


You would need Apple Pencil(tm)(r)(c) to use that tiny calculator on an iPad 😆


At this point, I feel like they're just messing with their customers. They sure know and can do it but won't because any publicity is publicity. Not that they need publicity, but still, any and all the hype matters.


You clearly don’t understand the great complexities and just how much more powerful the watch is in comparison to the iPad /s


Now its just a statement


Well yeah cause biggening up the calculator would look stupid apparently.


You don’t need one on the iPad, just use the Apple Watch /s


For everyone wanting the calculator app on iPad:

1) go to cutt.ly/ipadcalc in safari 
2) tap the share button in the top right corner
3) tap “add to home screen”


this has to be a running joke inside of apple, right?


Facts.


Does the ipad not have any good open source calculator apps? I feel bad for you guys stuck on that OS.


iPad calculator will be for M3 chip iPads only :D


Or how about that they don't automatically put the weather app on anything else but the iPhone. It just has to be a widget doesn't it?


Yeah it sucks. Apparently because I only have an ipad pro I'm not a good enough customer to deserve the ability to use an apple watch.

So backwards. I'd have spent a good deal of money more with apple if they weren't so anti-consumer


I deleted my iPad calculator app when I saw how much tracking it was doing.


Lol


A moron goes to the moon to find a breath of fresh air!


IKR!?!?!


Just Apple things


Ever happen to you to promise to someone to do something like they ask you a stupid thing and you say 
"don't worry I will do it soon, will be nice" and get so anxious of how you should do it and end up never doing it, the year pass and while your friend forgot about you still feel the shame out of it that you didn't do something so easy?

That is Apple now, if they put the same calculator on the ipad everyone will wait for so long for something so stupid, so they are like... no we need to find a better solution... the time will pass and they don't find a way to put the calculator out...


We have a calculator app on our iPad. It’s just like Apple’s, sometimes I forgot that it’s not. But, yes, I do agree with you on this lol.


How did this happen?  I pay bills with my Air4 and I have to download some crap to add things up.  I could use Excel but ya’know.


According to what I heard, the reason they refuse to put the calculator on ipad is the UI is so … difficult to change and if they put it there ,it will make the iPad look “less elegant “


Fucking so true

Welcome to the Apple ecosystem of slight inconvenience. Here we are passionate about not fixing simple things.


Rumores are that this will change soon. They should also just make an Apple Watch app that’s compatible on all devices. I have a friend who wants to get an android but wants to keep her Apple Watch but it’s not compatible


This is coming in iOS 17


I think apple wants that to include the phone call function by apple watch, syncing contacts and stuff. They brand it as a companion to the phone, in reality, just a ploy to get you to break the bank for an iphone


Because making the best experience is only a secondary goal. So it cannot clash with a primary goal which is money.

Letting you use a watch without a phone means you dont buy their biggest money maker.


This is by design as it makes people buy an iPhone. I am an example of this as I’d have an Android phone with an Apple Watch if I could.


You are so right


Newer models could be configured to be used by themselves. No iPad integration though...


Right here….wake the fuck up apple


Or that the watch can’t standalone on its own even though it has the technology to do so inside. They need to be paired with an iPhone. Super inconvenient, there’s other watches that take phone calls for a third the price without piggybacking on a phone account and requiring a physical phone.


I have a Galaxy Watch Active 2, which runs Samsung's Tizen OS. When I switched my phone from Samsung to Google nothing changed because Samsung publishes their wearable app and watch services on the Play Store for people that don't have their phones.

Even if I switched to an iPhone it would still work because they have an iOS app.


I mean… nobody “forced” you to buy an iPhone.


Apple got caught slowing there old phones down to make people buy new ones. You guys are really surprised that they do this? You're getting scammed lol tell me one thing apple devices can do that android can't, besides making you look like you got money.


Probably managing/maintaining/testing software with a super-edge case isn't worth it.

It's not "they're trying to sell iPhones"; pairing AW with additional devices require extra (possible fragile) software with edge cases to be written, and constantly maintained with each update and it wouldn't be worth to focus developer resources for something that would serve a VERY, VERY small number of people.


You could possibly buy an old iPhone you don’t intend to use and then set it up in [standalone mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211768) for “a family member”? Not a perfect solution, but it might be enough for some people.


Apple's mantra is basically "No, you want to use the product wrong"


I read it's supposed to be independent? or is it in thr upcoming release maybe


I think that there are some rumors that apple watch might become available for ipads


Thatll be implemented into 2030 gen


Yup, I bout a cheap used iphone just to use my watch lol. Don't even use the phone after.


But but….if you pair your Apple Watch with your iPad then how will Apple convince you to buy an iPhone? They want you to buy an iPhone …


That's the truth, it won't let you use all the features on one product


This is rumored to change after WWDC.


You don’t need an iPhone to use an Apple Watch. Surely the integration and other functions are enhanced with an iPhone, but it’s not required in recent years (the same way one can be used for an elderly parent, child, etc for those without a phone).


Anything to get their customers to buy one of everything every year with differences in each new model being so minimal that....you see where I'm going with this.


This. The watch should be able to function on its own, like many smartwatches do. This is apple trying to force us to have the watch and the iphone. Joke's on them, because this kind of inconvenience is why I haven't gotten an apple watch yet.


It comes with quantum engine powered by M5 chip


Very excited! I heard M3 and earlier only do multiplication and subtraction.


[Solves](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1394359548) looks native, has smooth animations and calculation history.

It also syncs on your iOS, iPadOS and macOS devices.


Pcalc feels very responsive though, but yeah just give us a native app already.


PCalc Lite.

Free. No ads. You can donate (I did), or you can buy PCalc full version if you want for more features. I just donated because the Lite version handles all of my needs.

The Lite version is far more functional than iPhone’s Calculator app.

You can keep PCalc hidden as a slide over window for quick and easy access.


The app "Solves" is pretty good.


Have you used calculator on iphone? Its really bad imo cant even see what you're trying to calculate


NumWorks is the one I use, it's decent.


Mine keeps trying to trick me into signing up for some monthy subscription for it. Drives me nuts.


Try symbolab


>3rd party apps suck

You have clearly never used PCalc then.


Technicalc is an amazing app and my favorite.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/technicalc-calculator/id1504965415


I like the app “Solve” as it has 4 calculations in 1 and let’s me store numbers


Ever heard of Spotlight? Haven’t used any calculator app in years. Spotlight does everything I need it to, quicker and on iPhone, Mac and iPad.


Solved and Calzy are great!


There are a couple calc app that don’t have ads and look fine, I have one. Can’t remember the name though.


No student wants a blown up phone app which is what you are asking for.


use pcalc lite. Free, no ads/subscription push, and works with stage manager and all the latest ipad advancements. Also, just looks insanely native.


Just use the search option to solve simple equations and for more advanced equations like most students need the default calculator won’t help you either


Desmos is a pretty good app.


UNO Calculator is good…free, no ads


There are excellent 3rd party apps


a calculator is a calculator, not sure how much better it can get. but the one i use is called "haseba"  


edit: just noticed that some calculators are paid lmao wtf. well this one isnt paid unless u wanna change the calculator colrs and stuff.


What is this? A calculator for ants?


What if I put it in the dryer at a higher temperature?


Why does apple actually do things that seem illogical though? We are always discussing one thing or another that obviously needs to be fixed


I meant that it’s dumb how they can put a calculator on a small screen but they can’t even port the iOS calculator app onto an iPad.


imagine an apple watch with ipados lol. I want to see a youtuber make that


They don’t want to bring stuff to the iPad before they can do it the “Apple way”, only to spend 12 years to make a weather app with nothing significant to justify that claim. A calculator as an app might not be the “Apple way”, but a widget sure would be.


“We want to wait until we can do something really great with it.” Or some shit


That was so cringe. An intern could literally build it perfectly. It's a calculator, it's already great.


No Craig’s response is right on. Don’t like it get a shitty android tablet.


It's not a good answer but it probably is accurate. That happens all the time at my company... there are technical things we want to do, but we don't have a great idea for it (yet) and then other priorities come around so we assign people to work on the priorities instead. Basically, he's saying is that a calculator app on the iPad is not a priority.

Technically there is a calculator built in to the iPad though... you can do calculations (and conversions, weather, etc) in spotlight on all of Apple's OSs.

All of that said, I think they should just take the iOS calculator landscape and portrait views and put them side by side in an iPad OS app.


We don't even need full app. Just create fucking control center widget and that would be enough for 99% of users because doing calculations with spotlight is not the most convenient way


They already do that with the IPhone calculator. You want to do anything other than basic operations? You must use landscape view. 

I didn't even realize it had pi and square roots and stuff until I incidentally rotated the phone just far enough for it to switch to landscape.

For a trillion dollar company, Apple is dumb as fuck. Android just lets you scroll to second page with extra operations and even shows you the history that you've entered.


There’s a lot of things Steve didn’t like, for example, bigger phones


Sometimes half assing something is way better than not doing it at all and this is one of those times


Hmm for some reason I don’t get the option to add it to my home screen, any other page works fine.


Not sure about touch screens and styluses, but yes the story says that it is a tribute to jobs.

It is also a great way to make people talk about your products without highlighting meaningful drawbacks


But is it free?


More upvotes for this beautiful project using the open source Windows Calculator.    


https://platform.uno/uno-calculator/


But Apple's OS is a joy to use. Whether it be OS X or iOS.


Seriously, this is the answer, it’s ridiculous to force the awkward UI of a calculator into a device that has a full keyboard available.


Why are people downvoting this..? I use this feature on my iPhone over the calculator. It’s way more convenient.


Because it's less convenient than opening up a dedicated app.


they initially scaled the iphone calculator for the ipad. then jobs saw it one week before launch and told the team to either build something new or scrap it.


They could also put it in control center so when you click it it either opens a small window next to control center or it takes over Control Center until you're done with the calculation; Or they can make it a slide over application


All they need to do is to make the size of calculator bigger…

It’s a stupid reason that “we want to add additional stuff and not just give a resized version of iOS calculator”, just give the resized version while you work on your “majestic calculator”, you can always update the apps 💀

If they wanna really add additional features, I can think of so many off the top of my head, a graphing calculator like desmos, a polynomial equation calculator like mathway, a matrix/determinant calculator, etc. just integrate all that stuff into the calculator app for iPad, If I can think of all this in 2mins, then there’s no way it’s taking Apple engineers 10+ yrs to think of this stuff


There's tons of extra features (both buttons and display) they could add. Like 16 years ago, in 1997, i had a TI-83 in high school.  Surely the ipad has enough process power just over a decade later to run those kinds of calculations.


>	they can remove features to make it smaller for the watch. but there is no additional stuff to make it with it as a big ipad app so they didn’t

Ok, now apply this “logic” to all the other Apple apps.


just put the same f*ing app on the ipad and adjust the size. 

we don't need additional features..


But not too long ago they did the weather app, which was the same situation.


Sometimes I wonder if they have more people in department of "Give reasons for not implementing feature X and Y" than actual innovators.


They lost the technology like NASA lost the technology to go to the moon


Yes, there are plenty of third party options. OP is questioning the lack of a stock solution on iPad when iPhone and Watch have them.


Easy questions with easy answers.

Jesus Christ, why u yelling


It depends on if the developer programmed the red button to close the window or quit the app.


I prefer solves


Same. Had no idea all my iPads did not have a calculator. I’m on my 5 th one as well. Haha.


Someone get this guy some kool aid and an AirPort Extreme router


Fixing? It's by design. Before you know it you'll have the whole ecosystem in your house that's when the sunk cost fallacy sinks in. You cant possibly leave apple now you've "invested" too much.


It's the Apple way, and how they upsell you. Need to connect more than one monitor and not use some weird DisplayLink setup? Guess you need to upgrade to the Macbook Pro. Want to try to use an iPad Mini as your hybrid mobile device? Sorry, you need a *real phone with real cell service*. And on and on and on.


Exactly. Case in point the iPads with M chips. If they wanted to they could literally make them like Mac minis. They’re essentially Mac minis with a different shape.


mans used the word "slight"


That was the point of the apple eco system!  If I want to be mildly inconvenienced by things that should easily port over I would go with android....oh wait I did.


Damn that’s edgy


Do you want multiple profiles on your 12" ipad? We don't do that around here.


Well maybe that's why they won't do it. Afraid people will switch phone..


Somehow I don't think Apple will make it easier to switch to Android.


But i'm pretty sure you'll need an iphone anyway to activate the apple watch. Let's wait and see if they will make the big leap.


Who's surprised? They're just voicing the frustration towards an inconvenience designed to make the customers spend more money. Nobody is just like "WHOA, Apple actually does this?! I thought they truly cared about us!"


Lol that sounds too plausible


Woah an App Store app that’s just made to be useful and doesn’t try to take your money via subscriptions? Very rare


It's such a great app that's criminally underrated. App store will never show it when searching for calculators. It doesn't even show up when searching for Solves. Seems like Apple doesn't really want people to find free apps because they can't make money off of IAPs or ads.


Using that on my iPad. Not that much, but is preety nice!


Same I use that


Just grabbed this. Thanks, works and looks great.


Wow, thanks for that!
I was searching for a good calculator app and I couldn't find one, this seems perfect!


Just an FYI to anyone looking for this on the App Store:  I couldn't find it when I searched for 'Solves' but I was able to when I looked for the author's name 'Oleg Barinov'.


Fractio is a pretty good iOS calculator I've been using for a while. It works on both iPad and iPhone.


Why the fuck didn’t this show up when I first got my iPad. Thank you for the link. Two seconds of use and it’s now my default on all devices. 

This is one major reason I hate apple. They just try to hide any app that out performs their own.


Thank you for this! I'll download it to my iPad tonight to try out.


I use it on my watch too, I’ve been loving it. And this dev takes donations instead, with nothing behind paywalls


Installed, sent over a tip to the dev. TIB.


I’ll check it out!
For the past several years I’ve used a grandfathered one from Impala Studios.
The currently-available version is $14.99 for lifetime access, and while I paid less imho it’s worth that.
It doesn’t sync across devices, but you can use it on all of them with one purchase, and it DOES have a robust history function and basic scientific (in landscape; conventional in vertical).
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/calculator/id487127942


literally can't find it using the search first 5 results are about AI and the other 10,000 are stupid games. i had to send the link to my iPad to install it. thanks stranger. i guess there are a lot more apps like this that no one can actually find. do you have any more useful ad-free apps like this?


PCalc using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is the way


My problem is that I refuse to buy a calculator app and hate it when they have ads 😭😭 I just use my iPhone lol


Yes, I use PCalc Lite, it's great, as is Solves.


It is pretty crap too lol why don’t they show us the history?


Yea I came to say the same thing. Spotlight works, and is probably a better scientific calculator than the normal app, but for simple stuff spotlight is annoying

For more advanced equations that are annoying to type out, Wolfram alpha you can just take a pic of an equation and it'll solve it


*Takes watch off wrist and hurls it to the floor.*


Personally I think the answer to the calculator app is simple. The reason they won't make an app is because when you scale up a calculator to the size of the screen, it will look ridiculous. So don't scale it up. Make an iphone-sized app that comes out from the corner when you swipe that corner, and overlays the current app in the background, similar to what you can do with notes and screenshot.


Pretty sure he was joking lol


r/whoosh


It's not that they can't. They won't (for w/e reason).


Bill Williamson


You have clearly never used the weather app on the iPad if you think that.


Yea and babble on how it has to iPad for them to do it. Im like WTF you make a plethora of other programs.


Wait really? Like it's just a fucking calculator, it's not 'really great' in any of your implementations it just adds numbers and that's ok


When that calculator comes out it better make wolfram alpha, photomath, mathway, and every other online calculator obsolete cuz this is taking too long.


I heard that BS too. Something else is at play, some licensing agreements maybe? I don’t know what the real deal is, but I know some BS when I hear it.


LOL. Dude I love Apple but fanboys like you are straight up embarrassing. You’ll defend anything they do that is warranted of criticism.


Don't forget professional medical advice


Or dying.


Or being alive.


"Perfect is the enemy of good."


You don’t even have to half-ass it.  Just put the same fricking one that’s on the phone and the laptop on an iPad.  It’s just so stupid.


If you want something half asses get an android or windows device.


Might be 😀


So, kill it on every other Apple device too because it’s useless is what you’re saying?


How is being able to hit `⌘-space`, or swipe down from the app launcher and start typing a calculation possibly less convenient than hitting `⌘-space` and typing _calc_, or going to the app launcher and finding the app, and then typing in an equation piece by piece in the correct order? You can’t edit what you’ve calculated so far in the iOS app, but you can go and add brackets, or edit intermediate parts of the equation in Spotlight.

If doing more, harder work is “more convenient”, then sure, but I can’t think of many people who would agree that definition makes sense.


I mean, yeah, both hand-in-hand


They are working on Mathematics 2, featuring physics from other universes, give them a break💀


that's their logic, not mine lmao. they literally said that in an interview word for word. why do people vote me down for it.


that's what you get for buying Apple devices. if Apple decides they don't want you to have a feature, not only are they not implementing it, they will make sure nobody else can.


What else will we lose ...time will only tell


I’m pretty positive it’s the apple calculator. Looks identical to my iPhone canculator


I mean fair….but this was nearly a decade ago and Steve hasn’t exactly been in charge for a minute.


Because Apple sucks for intentionally refusing to port their calculator to iPad


I usually just ask Siri if I have something basic to work out, and if I’m in a situation I actually need a calculator, my iPad is usually reserved to showing me reference or plans of whatever I’m working on. 

It feels weird that a situation where I’ve realised the iPad doesn’t have a calculator has never occurred. I really suck at maths and I do it a lot so I rely on calculators a lot.


I have an AirPort Extreme sitting on my desk doing nothing.


As an Apple shareholder, I applaud the strategy u describe.


I mean, this isn’t really true anymore. They’re all very interoperable now.


Want to use Siri to send a text through any app besides Messages? Sorry your SOL.


The HomePod annoys me so much with this. I'll ask it a question and it'll tell me it'll answer it, but only if I open up my iPhone. Shit is annoying...


Aah the dream and each profile opens up directly with different passwords. But that's just too user-friendly which we hate.


Subscriptions: the AppStore cancer!!


Is it?  I felt like building a nice calculator and putting it on the app store would be the first thing a fresh iOs developer would do, looks good on the resume, gives you some practice, etc.?


Math is a good one as well. It’s basically a free Wolfram Alpha made by Microsoft. Really useful.


Android Apps too.


Shout to r/apolloapp 

Yeah there's a pro option but its mostly for upkeep costs, and it's a single dev who donates a lot of it regularly, also partakes in the community. Good guy. Never needed or wanted another reddit app.


I searched "Solves Oleg Barinov" to find it.  Thank you!!


Seriously, what is this bs? Only way for me to find it was to type in Oleg Barinov...


Here are a couple of apps that I have found to be genuinely useful while being ad-free.

[LocalSend](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1661733229), a cross-platform file sharing app that works on the Wi-Fi network that you're connected to.

[QuickScan](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1513790291),  a fantastic app by u/yellow8_ for scanning and to OCR documents.


Here’s a good alternative to pcalc. Developer has posted this to Reddit before and got a positive response. 

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solves/id1394359548


Wait what? Pcalc is free, isn't it? Also maybe because I use adguard that's why I don't see any ads.


I've been using [Sci:Pro Calculator](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/sci-pro-calculator/id684978583?l=en) and it's pretty decent (and free).


Kalkulio is free and very nice.


PCalc is freeware and has no ads.  You can buy bundles of additional functionality, or just give the developer a tip if you appreciate the software.

I’m a fan of PCalc.  I use the Apple Watch version too, because I like the built-in tip calculator.


>	My problem is that I refuse to buy a calculator app

Even when that calculator is leaps and bounds above what Apple makes by default? I feel like you aren’t giving PCalc a fair shake simply because it has a $10 price tag


PCalc lite is free and has no ads


That’s exactly my workflow. All simple things are done by Spotlight (if I don’t have an actual calculator by hand), the rest is handled by Wolfram|Alpha. Must say that it is a lot quicker if you can type blindly and use a Mac, having to type everything on a touchscreen would be quite a pita.


they are just stupid dumbfucks. why not just use the mac layout and then style the buttons to be round?


Im curious what great changes they have made. As far as I can tell it’s basically an upscaled version of the iPhone app so nothing special about it. But I don’t really use it so I don’t know.


I use it but only the widget. The app itself offers nothing not already included in the iphone version, so by that logic a calculator wouldn’t be a problem either.


That's the Apple BS you have to deal with when working in corporate. Half of them think they are the next Steve Jobs.... Many of the designs and decisions lately make no sense. Steven would probably have the people who came up with the 10th gen iPad using the 1st gen Pencil with a dongle tortured.


Wrong. I have criticized Apple when they need it. This is not one. A blown up version of the app that adds nothing and and brings nothing to the larger display is stupid and lazy. If you want that go get a shitty Android or Windows tablet.


Or waiting his turn for organ transplants.


That would be half assing it.


Have you not had that problem with your video recorder button on iPhone where you think you’re recording but you’re not because both the record button and stop button are red and located exactly at the same spot on the screen? That’s on iPhone. And it hasn’t been fixed for almost 1.5 decades


Cuz a calculator app would be able to use with multitasking, and hold old answers. Without a keyboard can you even bring up spotlight without going to homescreen? Even just app switching is faster than going home AND swiping, if the app is already open. 

And you can say the complaints/differences are minor qol things but a calculator app is a minor, standard addition on a productivity device that runs people over $1000

Now idk what you're saying about the actual calculator app being worse than spotlight cuz I don't have an iPhone tbh.


If it was a stock app it would have been installed by default with iPadOS. I’m sure it’s a 3rd party one designed on purpose to look  like a stock one would, if one existed.


Did you continue to read through the article?

> “More than a decade has passed since Steve Jobs axed the calculator app for the first-gen iPad. And even the latest iPadOS 16 was released without a native calculator.”

> “When asked why in an interview, Craig Federighi — Apple's vice president of software engineering — explained that the iPad calculator app has fallen on the company's backburner over the years. Currently, no calculator for the iPad is in development. But if it's ever prioritized, it will reflect Apple's design philosophy, making it a truly unique, innovative solution (via MKBHD).“


True. It’s annoying


You guys ever wipe your butt and your butthole grabs onto a lil piece of tp, and then you got a lil torn piece of tp dangling out of your bhole ? And it feels weird cause u can kind of tell it’s inside you and hanging there? Then you gotta push out your anus lips just a bit so it can unkiss the ripped piece of tp and fall into the toilet with the rest?


Lol


Oh I mean computers tablets watches Homepods. Not the matter smart home tech


I am a new iOS user and I already hate subscription hell.


[removed]


It seems rare because if you search for a calculator or many other basic tools on the app store, all the first suggestions and consequently the most popular options are paid and subscription based.


Maybe that's the reason Apple didn't create an iPad calculator xD.


I hope your resume looks extra good with lots of free work on it 🤗


Actually, there is a non-subscription calculator app: it‘s called „iCalculate“.

Real glad you posted that, as I'd searched and searched (on my iPad and my iPhone) for "Solves" without finding it.  But your tip about searching for "Solves Oleg Barinov" did indeed turn it up and I've got it now.  Weird though.

Thank you!


i dont need it but i appreciate you saying how to search it for people who do. i even tried searching “solves oleg” and only one result came up and it wasn’t the right app. thats insane how they’re hiding it.


great tips, thank you once again.


Thank you so much!!


Will check it out thank you! How does the developer make any money though? It’s free and without ads


Best calculator for iPad


Ohhh I didn’t I will check it out, ad guard works? I had it for a bit but didn’t notice a difference or so
I thought hmmm


Pcalc just doesn’t have ads. It’s amazing.


Idk I can type blind but typing math equations still annoying asf haha. I was mostly referring to it being annoying on the iPad tho, never really used my computer as a calculator.


Not true.


[deleted]


The whole "if I'd have asked what customers wanted they would have said faster horses" mantra is like... true... But also it's exactly what narcissistic product designers say when people don't like their design and yet they double down on their "vision".


You know what it brings? It brings functionality that customers have asked for: being able to calculate things on the iPad you already have in your fucking hands. There *may* be valid reasons not to put a calculator on the iPad, but "we couldn't make it magical" isn't one of them. That's just a stupid, shitty, consumer-hostile excuse.


U know what’s even lazier? Not putting a calculator app on your $1000+ tablets to begin with.


Or not taking credit for other people's work and ideas.


Have never had this issue. Not once.


Good summary. I don't have an iPhone for comparison, but the android built in calculator would be a welcome addition.


Did not. At work.


I don't do that. I really don't shit very often, but when I do I use the back glass surface of an iPhone Pro Max to wipe with, then I rinse it off with the garden hose before giving it away to a homeless person. Then I buy another iPhone.


Where are you going with this?


I do the last part when I‘m sitting on the bus.


I didn’t say anything about Matter…


Another comment stealing bot.

https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/13ksmre/_/jkm0bs7/?context=1


People are paying to subscribe to a calculator?! That’s wild.


Well, Apple has the in¢entive to do this.


I'd venture, the reason would be more getting the user to buy one (and getting the %) then letting developers build the resume.


same that was the only way to find it.


https://apps.apple.com/in/app/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80-pro-%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F/id1226646910
This app is also ad free and seems to be working great.


I'm using Adguard and NextDNS and don't remember the last time I've seen an ad but it might depend on your use case. I recall that it didn't stop ads in the Youtube app, for example.


That’s true, although you do get used to it after a while:). I have all of my documents on my computer and don’t use an iPad to write (yet), so my Mac usually is the most accessible calculator to me


Ok please name a feature not included on the iphone


He nixed it because they literally stretched the iPhone calculator app. I agree with this decision. However, Steve died in 2011 and Apple has failed to come up with *anything.*


Only the majority have not been asking for it.


You know what’s lazier? Your comment.


Well a lot of people have and nothing has been done to fix it. Stop sucking that Apple juice so much you’re starting to look like a widget


*This* is the way


LMAO


Our engineers just don't like math


Strong claims require strong evidence. Let's see your source on that.


Damn you're cringe dude. Get a life outside sucking apples dick.


You’re not very intelligent


DarthKalElTV = Eric Cartman who actually got an iPad.


Lol I’m glad I got some backup here and wasn’t the only one who found this dude’s blind defense of Apple cringe and embarrassing as fuck.


Lol this guy has to be the alternate reality version of Eric Cartman that got his iPad as soon as he asked for it.


I’m not intelligent because I said something was wrong with apple’s ux ? Oh noes! Apple gods will strike me down because of how stupid I am what am I to do? What am I to do??? Lmao you sound extremely smart


Lol not at all, man. It's hilarious to read those comments.


Thanks for proving my point.


Are you an Apple bot? 

Edit: 
Omg you are an Apple bot. Hahaha this is hilarious.


64 GB base storage though…


I didn’t think they were gonna put the M1 inside it. I thought that was gonna eat into IPad Pro sales.


An M1 running iPadOS feels like putting a Lamborghini engine in an Isuzu box truck with 15-year old dry-rotted tires.


Tbh I value ProMotion (or a better OS) more than faster silicon on an iPad ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


Uhh So I guess I'll still get the pro? Isn't the only difference now a 120hz screen. Does that even affect me at all if I use it for uni work and editing/drawing? :/ am getting mixed opinions


It was true, all of it.


64gb in 2022 is a joke.


Processing power of a NASA spaceship

With an operating system less capable than iOS and on top of that 64GB base storage 

Is Apple even trying anymore?


64gb on this thing is ridiculous


Will the iPad Air 4 most likely drop in price now? I don’t see the need to get this new one and I’ve been eyeing the air 4 for a while now


I feel like Apple lineups of products are a mess rn. Why bring the M1 to the Air? The differences between it and the Pro are way too minimal for most consumers to care at this point. Why the MacBook Air hasn't been updated to the new design language yet? Why there are two different design languages for the MacBook pro? Where is the iMac Pro? Why there isn't a Mini with M1 Pro? Why use the 8 outer shells for the SE instead of the XR? The products are all great but the lineups are a mess honestly and most price points are confusing.


Many people were expecting 128GB for 599, that would be an instant buy. 
But tbh knowing Apple it would be either this or a price increase because of the new M1 chip…


That’s great Apple. 

How about Final Cut Pro to make use of it?


I got the Air 4 to use for college last year, is it worth it to upgrade to this one? My gut and wallet are telling me no lol.


Even with the M1 I think refurbished 2018 Pros are better midrange devices. The speakers, display, and Face ID are worth the performance penalty when… frankly, there isn’t much the old A12X even stutters with at this point. Hopefully that changes soon, though.


The iPad Air would be a great middle ground if it had a 90 Hz display. 

* Base iPad - 60 Hz
* Air - 90 Hz*
* Pro - 120 Hz

This needs to happen! Come on Apple! I really don't care about the M1 since iPadOS is so limiting.


Struggling to justify not just jumping for the 156GB 11in iPad Pro over the 256GB iPad Air. 64GB is a joke for 2022, 156GB is really the sweet spot, so the Air I would purchase would run $749 and the Pro would be $799 and comes with ProMotion (HUGE selling point) and FaceID for $50 more. I could also just pick it up today...


$600 for 64GB. Come the fuck on Apple. No thanks.


64gb, no


I purchased an Ipad Air a few weeks back that is still currently in the return window. Is there any reason why I shouldn't return it and wait for the new one?


I just want a normal iPad with the new design and Apple Pencil 2 bunt with a normal mid-range apple SoC or something like that, the outdated design is the only thing stopping me from getting an iPad


64gb for the base 👎 again. If you bump up the storage you are better off getting the pro.

I don’t think they mentioned the biometric method, assuming it’s still Touch ID.


Would’ve rather had a Mini-LED screen and/or 4 speakers instead of the M1.


Wait so it’s only $100 more than the iPad mini 6?


[deleted]


This may actually convince me to finally get an iPad air. I was on the fence about getting a pro, but after this announcement, I don't think shelling out more for the pro is worth it.


I’d still choose my 2017 iPad Pro with pro motion 120 hz over the new iPad Air. I’ll probably  get the next iPad Pro


I bet now I can download file from telegram in the background.


I just recently bought an iPad Air for my stepdaughter for college use.  I don’t regret it because this update wouldn’t benefit her a whole lot for the needs that she has.

The M1 is complete lost on the iPad until Apple updates iPadOS to be able to use it to full potential.  Also… they updated the USB-c bandwidth to 10Gbps.  This sounds like artificial market segmentation given that the M1 supports thunderbolt.


Air $599 for 64GB and $749 for 256GB
Pro $799 for 128GB and $899 for 256GB


Still no flash.


Have to say I’m a little over the “iPad Air with M1 kills the iPad Pro” buzz with YouTubers covering todays event.

Did the MacBook Air kill the MacBook Pro when they released the M1 models or did they serve different end users and both succeed?

I’m excited that the power of M1 is coming at a lower entry point, when more people are given the power to create, great things can happen.


I’m getting an 11” Pro after seeing the 64GB base storage. Here’s my main usage:

* photo editing (camera/iPhone in RAW/ProRAW)
* video conferencing (family, work)
* media consumption
* gaming (Minecraft with the kids)

I’ll need more than 64GB (won’t need 256GB) so I’d be paying for the higher storage for the Air.

For an extra AUD$40, with the 11” Pro, I’d be getting

* FaceID
* ProMotion display
* Better front-facing camera
* Better rear facing camera & LIDAR (kids can use it for stop-motion animation etc)
* Better speakers
* Thunderbolt support

Seems like a no-brainer for that?


How much Ram ?


This iPad Air at 699$ or the iPad Air 4 brand new at 429$?


Is it OLED?


Still no XDR on the 11” pro :(


IMO, people who can only do with the base 64gb storage should buy the new M1 Air. For most people, a base iPad Pro with 128gb storage at $799 ($50 more than the 256gb Air) is a more practical buy.
120Hz display js well worth the $50


So strange how they refuse to replace Space Grey with Midnight on iPads. I also hate that they replaced neutral silver with starlight only on certain products. Nothing matches across product lines!!


I was not expecting this.

Definitely picking one of these up. The iPad Pro is far too expensive. And the Mac mini has its own issues (jelly scroll).

The air is perfect. And with the M1 it’s a really good deal.


A CPU upgrade it didn’t even need and still packing 64gb of storage. I mean my old 10.5 pro has used 67gb of storage just in apps and I don’t have that many apps. 

128 should have been the minimum and they should have thrown in 120hz LCD without True Tone or whatever. That would have been more useful to the typical buyer.

I also don’t get why they put A13 in a monitor. I mean that is powerful cpu. What are they doing with it? Are they going to give the monitor like an “iMac lite” mode where you can basically run it like a big iPad or Apple TV?


Will the iPad Air 4 cases fit this as well?


Well I guess I can’t call my iPad Pro the most powerful model anymore (maybe) I always upgrade trade in every time a new one is out but like, I feel as if they should’ve expanded on iPad OS so that it ACTUALLY unlocks the full potential of m1 which has been the critical standpoint of critics since it came out, all that beefy power and nothing to fully utilize it besides certain games like genshin impact at 120 fps (with frame drops from heat)


Side from 120hz it’s basically the 11 inch pro


May just sell my pro and get one of these.


Same boring products year after year


They should have just kept the Air using iPhone SoCs and made it cheaper...putting M1 on this thing that doesn't even have proper file management is just plain dumb.


We’ve had Face ID for how many years now? And we still can’t get it on the fn iPad Air? Do any of the iPads have it?


Anyone think it’s wise to finally trade in my aging 2015 MacBook Pro and move to an iPad Air?  I rarely use my MacBook Pro but always use my iPad which is also an older iPad from 2017 I think.


Will the Logitech Combo Touch for the Air 4 work with the Air 5? I assume yes??


Is this going to be better than the iPad Pro? I have the 1TB model


[deleted]


Meh


Promotion?


Bit weird that this doesn’t have flash, considering the iPad mini does.


Any update on the price of the previous model now?


Just got the air 4....


I just bought an air…


Gives it an M1 but will never tap that power. Especially with iPad OS


Not what we asked for but ok apple do ya thing. Come out with another iPad in September too cause you know ppl will buy it too 🤦‍♀️


The lack of 128 base storage utterly disappoints me. Is the RAM confirmed more than 4 GB?


I want to buy an ipad for the first time, do you think i should go for new air 64gb. My use- study, notetaking maybe little media consumption


I would be more excited for this if it had Face ID. I have that on my Pro but finger only on my mini and honestly and I can’t stand using finger anymore. We’re way passed that technology and there’s no point in keeping it around when you’ve already proven you can do it on similar specked devices


I literally just bought the iPad Air 4th generation 2 weeks ago. I-I just-wtf.


W H Y oh WHY ?!?!!!!!???


They didnt announce a 27 inch m1 mac yet? Are ya fahking kidding me?


Huwawei Matebook E as soon as it's intel 12th Gen will be a great 2-in-1. As Apple have ipad and macbook it is better to go for the former.


The old iPad Air was already very powerful, it is the OS that is restrictive as fuck.


Now let it run Mac OS pleaseeeeee.


give us macOS instead of ipadOS then we will talk


Those colors are hideous


No ProMotion. Already dead to me :-)


The way I literally JUST bought one I’m so pissed.


This is so stupid. iPadOS is a total waste of the m1. There is no reason to buy this.


[deleted]


Did they say when the pre-order starts?


Hi there, what's app was on 24:37? Thank you!


If I mainly use my current 2018 iPad Pro 11" to stream content and light photo editing using my Apple Pencil, is there any reason I would choose the current iPad Pro over this new iPad Air? Storage isn't an issue and as far as I can tell, all I'd really be losing is ProMotion


[deleted]


Probably not a full-fledged but including some binned chips


Have the 2020 ipad air 4. Should i upgrade to the m1 version?


Okay so I have the 2020 iPad Pro (the one before the M1 upgrade) and entertaining this idea to of upgrade (or downgrade?) to the newest iPad with Centre Stage… most likely the Air just because it’s cheaper.

I don’t really do much on my iPad except for entertainment, some photo editing and drawing. It also served as my main computer though..

What do you guys think? Should I trade my iPad Pro with the new Air?


Y’all are welcome my friend said she just bought an iPad Air yesterday. The sacrifice was successful.


Well frankly I don't see a point of this it's better to go with pro or save money and go with budget option


Where is the flash for iPad Air? Mini and pro already have it


I have the 2020 iPad Air and I’ve literally never once thought “man I wish this was faster”.  I would only upgrade for Pro motion at this point, but even then… meh


Surprising they still kept space grey for the air. Starlight but no midnight?


Think selling a air 4 and upgrading for £240 is worth it?


Honestly, this is going to fuck over resell value of the pro m1. Why buy second hand pro m1 when you can get brand spanking new air 5 with the same chip


Does the iPad Air have 4 speakers?


Base model at 64GB, what a joke!


[removed]


That's some good value, if only I didn't hate the TouchID power button so much. My wife has one and it's very unreliable and hard to authenticate with a case. I'll take Face ID over it 100%


Hey guys! I love my old iPad (6th gen), but I feel like it's good time to replace it this season (mine have few dents and cracked screen).

Looking at the ipad air refresh - seems like M1 might be an overkill. I either use it at home in bed or during travel. I generally only web browse, watch youtube/netflix/other streaming platforms and occasionally play a turn based game (not overly demanding). Might buy pencil and try to doddle a little bit.

So between new air and current mini - what would be your judgement? Is the power difference significant? anyone has any view on screen size for above use cases? Possible higher battery drain?

I'm not sure what to feel about M1 or saving 100 at the cost of  familiar form factor.


So when does the iPad 4 get cheaper?


Lol saw someone literally yesterday on one of these apple subs saying “there’s no way it’ll be the M1 in the air, probably the A15”


Just make macOS an app that instantly freezes and resumes and I’d buy whatever iPad they ship day-one


[deleted]


available when? *


We all know how OP the m1 chip is with the current ipadOS. Anyone think apple might make macOS available on ipads  when the regular ipad eventually also gets M1


so this is the 5th gen iPad air? does that mean that the 4th gen is available still and cheaper or? I've been wanting to buy one for a while now but only one compatible with the 2nd gen apple pencil..


2022 iPad Pro will probably get the M2 by 2022 WWDC in June.

If you're using iPad to browse, email and video then the $300 iPad may be sufficient until Software Updates cease and become Security Updates.


bought a pro 11 a week ago. Still not sure if I return it to go for the Air 5… =x


Happy it got the M1 even with just 64GB storage


With the ipad getting the m1 processor , is it worth it buying a macbook air with the same processor ?


I was really hoping for an M1 27” iMac yesterday.


I am just waiting for the M1 iPad Mini


I’m holding out for the M1 Max IPad


Seeing M1 in this iPad was a huge surprise, many YouTubers are glossing over this - because Mac studio is amazing. I joked with friends, it’s time for the iPad Pro to be revamped, so we can get a 3rd Gen pencil which perfectly leads to new hardware for the base iPad. I don’t think I’m too far off anymore.

Edit to add: could we see M1 added to iPhone?? Probably not 14 but likely 15.


Do you really need that much CPU? My 1st gen iPad from 2010 still works great for playing movies and reading books. I wish they would work on making them cheaper.  The Air's nicer screen is really nice, and cheaper would help schools.


I wonder if Apple will ever configure the iPad os to allow multiple users? My wife and I both kind of want n ipad and have sever use cases for one, but there is no way we are buying 2 separate iPads. I’d imagine there are a lot of couples/families who could benefit from multiple users being able to log into their own unique profile on the same iPad. 

It would be incredible if I unlocked my iPad with my finger and it automatically opened to the Home Screen layout I had set up, was signed into my email account, my Instagram/twitter/spotify/Pinterest/Reddit/etc account, my photo library, and my settings, with the ability to choose items/apps/setting that were shared or accessible from all account. Then, when my wife unlocked the iPad it would be all her stuff. So much easier than signing out and in to multiple account across all our apps. 

Will Apple ever offer this? Is it even possible?


Apple hasn’t been the same since 2010


Your next computer **definitely** is powerful but not a computer.
iPadOS and M1 are two combinations that will never be correct since iPadOS can’t take advantage of what M1 was made for, which are intensive programs that Mac with M1 can run but iPad with M1 can’t run, and I’m waiting for developers to make apps specifically for the M1 iPads to be actually worth it compared to iPads with A-series, unfortunately the App Store apps are designed to work with all platforms and not specific models.


Yeah and the 256gb model is almost the same price as the iPad Pro 128gb, I'd rather have the 128gb plus Promotion display than the iPad Air with 256gb storage. The Air would have been really good with a 128gb base storage like what most phones or tablets have in its price range.


That's what I have in my iPad Pro and I don't really see the need for more. 64 GB definitely isn't what I'd call "reasonable" for $600, but it's still more of a "good to have" then a "need to have"


The only reason they even offer this size is so they can say “starting at $599.” I’m willing to bet most customers will choose the larger storage sizes.


For what I use my iPad for that’s more than enough. Granted for what I use my iPad for I also don’t need an M1 processor….


I probably wouldn't need more.  I don't play many games and all my photos are on my phone or physical camera.  The iPad, for most, is strictly a media consumption device, so it's nice to have a low entry price point.


In my opinion that's a good amount. Im not a mobile gamer, and I primarily stream content so there isn't much of a need to download things on a tablet, for me at least. Photos have always been the bulk of my storage usage and I'm not taking photos on an ipad


And the new pro-ish Model starts at 512GB for $2,000+.


Idk if I’m weird but I stream almost everything or store it in the cloud.


Feels audacious in 2022 honestly.


Eww! Come on, Apple!


Obviously it’s because there are two types of users - media consumers and content creators. 

Consumers can mostly get by with 64gb but content creators can’t. 

As usual apple knows their customers best.


I was ready to pre-order if they had gone with 128GB.  And 256 is just overkill.  Probably going with a refurbished pro instead now…


flying ipad air


120hz is still unmatched tho


[deleted]


If I had to guess I’d imagine there’s some upcoming iPadOS features that will only work on M1 and beyond. Or they’re gonna phase out 11 inch iPad Pro for something else.


Honestly, I would have preferred if they added 120Hz instead of the M1. M1 is kinda overkill for a tablet and 120Hz makes such a huge difference in how smooth the device feels.


120hz screens on the Pro (plus the mini LED on the 12.9) Plus Thunderbolt gives the Pro some differentiation.

Plus, unless you go for the 64GB version, you are paying close to the price of the 128GB version anyway.


The 11 inch pro is pretty gimped without the mini led display, I feel they’ll kill it off


I may be the only one that cares but LIDAR makes AR so damn fast when it comes to understanding a space.


Was pretty obvious cause of the crunch face by a15 between IP13 & the IPad Mini.


I know people who buy the 15/16" MBP just for web browsing, word processing, and video streaming, so I'm guessing this fits into that market.


Lmao this is so true.  I regret buying an M1 iPad Pro.  It’s probably my most regretted apple purchase.  I don’t think it’s worth the cost at all.  Now my M1 air is a completely different story.  I love that laptop.


Feels like iPad pro or iPad air 4 owner


As my friend, who used to work for Apple, says: "Apple is really good with hardware, not as much with software."

They need to unleash their hardware's potential.


Agreed, although the one big silver lining is that an M1 iPad is going to feel like a fast device for *years*. The M1 iPad Air will have zero issues running the latest iPadOS version in 2027 (imho).


So much power, so little cam take advantage of that power


Now that’s something I’d like to see in real life


Yeah better if they gave us some weak and old processor so we can switch to a new ipad in 3 years because it lags and doesnt get updates.


The OS is what holds it back.  I just can’t get any real work done on it.  Anytime I need to use it for anything other than content consumption and Netflix I grab my M1 MacBook Air.  It’s just so much easier to do anything and keep files organized on MacOS.  I appreciate the iPadOS but it’s just way too restricting


Just picked up a refurbished 2018 Pro for less than this Air and don’t regret it at all. I’m with you on ProMotion.


Yep I had the iPad Air 4 and while it opened everything extremely fast (faster than my 2018 pro in single threaded processes) it just felt too choppy with that 60hz… I don’t know what it is but ever since I’ve used 120hz on iPad every other 60hz iPad has felt really bad. I don’t have this issue when I go back to 60hz on iPhone though.


If this had promotion its basically the 11” pro


I bought my Pro over the Air entirely for ProMotion.


Give me pro motion and this is a day one but


Speakers, Face ID


For drawing it might affect you if you go for the Air. 120hz is really incredible


Don’t forget 128GB is standard on the Pro, and there’s no 128GB option for the Air (have to skip to 256GB). If 64GB is too small for you, keep that in mind when comparing prices.


FWIW, I bought an Apple Refurbished iPad Pro last year and I couldn't find any sign that it wasn't "new" besides it coming in a different box. Good way to get a Pro at a discount.


The differences are:      
- 4 speakers    
- LiDAR Scanner       
- Extra camera lens (ultra-wide) on the back.       
- 120hz    
- more storage options       
 
The iPad Air may be a better value depending on how valuable you perceive above specs is, and ultimately depends on your workflow, (in your case, it doesn’t really matter (?), but if you’re wanting the pro, I think it’s better to wait till it gets updated like the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13”, Mac Mini and iMac 24”


Depends on your work.

If you do 4k editing then get the pro‚ a better display and more power

the other additional features are not worth the extra money


120hz screen itself makes little to no difference but the 11 in Pro especially on sale is not that much more than the Air which somehow rarely goes on meaningful sale so I would almost always suggest going Pro.


thunderbolt


yup

iPad Pro will be OLED, M1 Pro, 4 speakers, 120 Hz, more cameras, narrower bezel.


Going by how long they were selling 16GB iPhones, and by the fact that iCloud still starts at 5GB, 64GB will still be a joke come 2026…


I was hoping someone said that.


People are still defending it in this thread lol. 

I get tired of the “well ***I*** don’t need more so it’s ok” comments


Just want space to have space even if u dont need it… 2022 is the era of cloud…


which is why everyone should get M1 Ultra with 128GB.


Even 128GB isn't sufficient these days.


I’d like an iPad Air for $599, not $749. If that means 64gb, I’m fine with it.


At this point it should be plainly apparent that every entry level product in virtually every Apple product line is underspeced in one or more ways in order to simultaneously appeal to casual tech buyers and push them to *rent* upgraded specs like storage in the cloud. I mean, c’mon… they’ve been doing this for a long time. Doesn’t make it awesome for consumers, but it’s long past time for shock.


I agree. It's too much. Since I store nothing on my ipad, if there were a cheaper 32gb option, I'd be all over it.


It really isn't. I have the 64GB iPad Air Gen 4 and it's \*very\* usable.


Do they really need to when no competitor can seem to release a more desirable product?


How is iPadOS less capable than iOS?


Why were you expecting software updates when WWDC is months away?

Base storage of 64 gb is fine for 70%+ of people so that’s a non issue for any consumer oriented device.


I mean TBF my microwave probably has more processing power than many famous NASA spaceships


[deleted]


Not regretting my baseline iPad at all. Sure, the forehead and chin is fine, but I’m not really missing out by not jumping up to the Air for even less storage.


Nah, 32gb on the iPad is ridiculous. There are a large majority of iOS air users who will be fine with 64. And the jump up is 256gb which is great for those who need it.


[deleted]


I’m curious about that too. I broke my iPad Pro but I only use my iPad to watch movies and videos so if the iPad Air 4 drops in price I’d rather get that 🤔


Maybe but unlikely. The Air 4 like never went on sale.


i bought air 4 in like late jan. Sadge.


I got one on Amazon for $75 off MSRP for the 256gb version. Or maybe it was $75 off the student price. Anyway it didn't have Prime but it was genuine shrinkwrapped and sealed.


Depends on whether it's still listed. I suspect not. You'll probably have to go for refurbs or secondhand sets.


It dropped by 10% on Amazon todat


My guess is that the M1 chip is on a 2 year refresh cycle, and Apple’s priority right now is to fully transition their entire Mac lineup to Apple silicon. Not to mention there really isn’t anything on the market which comes remotely close to matching the M1 chip in terms of performance and power efficiency, so Apple evidently doesn’t feel too much pressure in this regard. 

The iPad Air gets the M1 chip because it’s more efficient from a supply chain perspective, and Apple probably isn’t too bothered about which model you buy so long as it’s from them. Plus the iPad Pro is likely getting a refresh later this year. 

As for the iMac Pro, looks like it’s been replaced by the Mac studio / studio display combo. 

With regards to the Xr, if you have been following past trends, Apple typically waits 4 years before reusing a form factor for the SE, so my guess is that any iPhone X-like redesign will wait till next year. 

Kinda makes sense to me. 😎


Re the iPad lineup, the iPad Pro has a 18 month refresh cycle on average, so let’s bet that it will get the M2 in the fall, and the base iPad is on a yearly refresh so it will probably get the A14 in the fall. Going into Christmas, the lineup will look like:

-	iPad with an A14
-	iPad Mini with an A15
-	iPad Air with M1
-	iPad Pro with M2

Which is a pretty logical line up. The issue is just the 6 months between the spring and fall event, but apple probably looks further ahead to what their lineup will look like in their most important quarter.

iPhone lineup will likely be
-	iPhone SE @ $429 with A15
-	iPhone 12 mini @ $499 with A14
-	iPhone 12 @ $599 with A14
-	iPhone 13 mini @ $599 with A15
-	iPhone 13 @ $699 with A15
-	iPhone 14 @ $799 with A16
-	iPhone 14 Max @ $899 with A16
-	iPhone 14 Pro @ $999 with A16
-	iPhone 14 Pro Max @ $1099 with A16

It makes much more sense when you look at it like this IMO


>Many people were expecting 128GB for 599, that would be an instant buy.

To not even have a 128 option is just pure greed on Apple's part. They know it's what most people would choose.


Yeah. I was ready to purchase it to replace my old iPad. Saw the 64GB for that price, no way.


That would instant kill on thier pro iPads. It's astonishing how they don't never want to give anything for the price the customer wants for, pure simple buisness.


That was the iMovie update. /s


[deleted]


Don't get new versions of devices every year


Idk if what I say makes sense, but I haven't felt the need to upgrade my iPad 7, and I am a geek.


Nope. Only way you use the extra power on new chip is if you play latest games and even then I am not sure if there are any / many games out there that'd benefit. older  ipad air's cpu is plenty powerful for an ipad. I am actually hoping to find a good deal on old one and buy that


Definitely not. Still using my iPad Pro 10.5 from 2017 and it runs really well on OS15. I am looking to maybe upgrade when the next pro comes out but in my mind iPads are at least 4-5 year devices.


Nope.


Heck, the 2017 10.5” Pros are still very capable devices. I’ve reached my pre-designated “time to upgrade” window and I’m finding it hard to determine a justified need to replace it.


My 2018 pro is my main computer at this point. I feel zero temptation for this thing except that there's a blue option. If they bring out M2 and mini-led or OLED on an 11 inch pro this fall, I will instant buy it because I'm a nerd and have unnatural love for my iPad. Refurb 2018 pros are definitely a solid buy for most people.


I am also in the same boat… I actually don’t need the 256GB variant …  they are basically the same size, same weight. The pro has a better screen, better camera, Face ID.  

Please let me know what you have decided.


Its the same price as the one you bought it for so definitely return it and wait for the new one


seriously return it asap.


Yeah if it’s the same price you got it then definitely return. My iPad Air 4 was delivered just yesterday but probably wouldn’t return as I’ve gotten a discount.


no


The colors are not the same. That's the only reason why you would want to hold on to the old one.


The base iPad is great, don’t let the hype fool you. The USB-C port on the fancy machines aren’t really that useful for anything other than minor cable convenience. The 7th gen base iPad and forward support fast charging just fine and in use the gen 1 and gen 2 pencils perform identically.


Get a refurbished Air 4. You'll pay about 100 bucks more, but you'll get what you want.


It’s touch id


Touch ID on the power/sleep button


Yes, because that’s exactly what Apple want people to do. Drive buyers to a higher margin product.


Then spend a bit more for the pro?


The same price as the Air 4 at launch.


I love my mini6


This is literally how chip development has almost always worked


If all you need is 64GB of storage, then yes. But if you are wanting a higher storage option it is worth noting that your cost will be $749 for 256GB when you could swing for the 156GB iPad Pro for only $50 more and get ProMotion and FaceID. This is where I'm landing so figured I'd flag!


Exact same boat here. I'm hoping that the screen of the 12.9 comes to the next 11" Pro. Then I'll upgrade my '17 10.5" Pro


Large file transfers fail on ipads all the time so the bandwidth increased or not doesn't really matter in my experience


Exactly.. where is the catch I wonder.. I am also in favour of picking up a 11”pro… 64GB is not good enough and 256gb is more then I need.


This is exactly where I landed, too. Picking mine up today, so there's the additional perk of not having to wait 1.5 weeks!


Thanks for this, I was confused about why you wouldn’t do this, same use case and same thought process


8GB


Who has the air 4 for $429?


The Air 2020 is already plenty beefy, don’t pay 50% more for power that you’re not going to use. At the price you’re getting it it’s an absolute treat.


Nope, the same (good) LCD as on the previous air 4.


Which one are you getting? 64gb or 256


But the complaint earlier was that if the Air had these things minus the 128GB, what would be the purpose be for the 11" Pro


Everything I am seeing points to yes.


Why? Pro is better


iPads Pro do.


It was so cool when the iPad mini 5 and the iPad Air 3 were like the same device in two different sizes. Now they’re very similar too (and I assume for most users the performance difference won’t be too noticeable) but to me it’s so weird that the mini has a LED flash and the Air doesn’t.


Refund it! You got 14 days


Would be a Beast.
U can edit something, M1 is a overkill.


It's been discontinued. The Mac Studio + Studio Display seem to be the replacement.


i know right.. ps.. which Apple paid bots keep downvote MacOS on IPad? it's a feature a lot of peole are asking for.  99% people using ipad right now are watching youtube or surf the net. M1 chip varaints and current IPad is way too powerful for just watching youtube and surf the net.


you should be able to return your current iPad within a certain period... check with your apple store for more info


What else would they put in it? M1 ist faster than literally all other mobile chips, and any of the more powerful SoCs would just burn your fingers.


Friday


I think this Friday


There's also faceid instead of touch and better speakers.


64GB means you have roughly 50GB or so of space to use. If you don't have a lot of apps or download content, you should be fine with it. Most people I know that have 64GB iPads are fine with it because they use cloud storage for pictures/videos and rarely download episodes/movies from the streaming services. 

I always buy larger storage capacity because I only upgrade once every 4-5 years, so it's a one-time investment for me.


Yes. Why not?


My iPad Air 4 was delivered yesterday lmao. Probably wouldn’t return for the 5 as the upgrades aren’t worth the discount I got (for my use case)


people who want 120hz refresh rate


Yes. The mini 6 has 4 also.


So will the A-series chips go to the iPhone and Mini while the higher iPads and Macbooks get the M-series?


New Air vs Current mini, assuming you don't care about the M1, is a decision that is 99% a display size choice.


Pre orders start on 3/11.


doubt it... Ipad pro already has M1. Apple doesn't want to cut their money making machine in half. people (college kids) forced to buy a mac pro and a ipad for now.


Isn't that the point, to upsell people to the pro? It's very deliberate that they don't offer 128gb Airs.


That’s what I’m gonna do! :)
Have an Air 4 at the moment & the 64GB sucksBallz. Got a speedy usb C Samsung 128GB flash drive for $20 (Read450MB/s, Write 80MB/s) but it’s still a hassle cause I need to keep a tight leash on apps installed (most commonly used apps like anatomy are 1GB+, Civ 6 4GB etc ) so the space keeps feeling up.

The difference between Air 5 256GB & Pro is just 3k (in my local currency) thus it’s a much better deal cause of speakers, brighter, better display right?


That's exactly what Apple Want you to think...

They launch the base model with a very good price to catch your eyes on it, and then you'll found that 64 Gb isn't enough so you'll upgrade to 256 Gb model. At that point you'll also found that the price is very close to the base line pro model, eventually you'll spend a lot more than you originally planned on.


No 128G, definitely on purpose


Depends, you must be a rather light user storage wise.

Also down the road having such a limited amount of space will hurt as file sizes and app sizes creep upward.


[deleted]


I doubt it. 

I got an iPad Air last year. Got the 64GB version, and I have like 45GB available. It’s not hard to imagine that a lot of people don’t store much on their iPads. 

It’s not typically a primary music listening device. It’s not a primary photo taking device. Only need local movies if you’re on a flight. Not everyone is a professional photographer or videographer editing large files on their iPads.


> I’m willing to bet most customers will choose the larger storage sizes.

No way. Base model Apple products are usually the most popular.


I know exactly why they offer that size, because that is what I would buy. I don't even understand why you'd need that much. All pictures and video go in the cloud, I don't download more than a couple dozen apps at most, no fluff or rubbish allowed, I'd choose 32 GB if that was an option. This size is for users like me who just want an excellent screen to browse the web, watch movies and shows and play a few games. Simple. I bet they sell more of these lower storage options to the mass market.


I would choose the 64 every time lol. I only use an iPad for reading ebooks, light internet browsing, occasional FaceTiming, and streaming/YouTube. I don’t put photos on my iPad, I don’t use the back camera, I use very few apps, don’t use it for art, don’t use it for school, etc.


I personally never get storage upgrades, I just don’t have that many files. I also have access to decent enough internet to just use a lot of iCloud


100% 
I just bought a Green 256gb 4th Gen Air about 7 weeks ago. Debating the upgrade for M1. I usually keep iPads 5-6 years. I just upgraded from OG 12.9 IPP.


They would be fool not to go with pro then.
If storage is prime focus than only It makes sense.


In Germany its 679€. Which is the same as 739$. Thats almost a quarter price increase, just for another country. Maybe im missing taxes, idk how it goes in the states, but that still pisses me off tbh.


Old people 

Source: I work in Best Buy


I use the iPad mostly to read ebooks so I’ll be getting the 64GB version.


Yeah I'm with you.  I rarely need storage on my iPad.  Debating updating my air 4.  So the pro is better than the air 5?


No point in having an M1 chip device if it’s purely for media consumption


Same here!  Very disappointed that 128GB isn't offered, deal-breaker for me.


Yeah 120 Hz sells the 11 inch iPad Pro for me


yeah, ipad air with 120hz and A14 would have been a much better upgrade but that'd also have rendered ipad pro pointless for majority of people


As is FaceID and the options to go larger than 256 are unmatched

Not to mention mini led


Guess I hold onto my iPad Pro 10.5 until the next Pro comes out.  
I need that 120hz and hopefully they bring a new display tech alongside it.  
I really wanted today’s Air to check that Promotion, but alas it was not meant to be….


Is it worth the extra money though?


But add a pen or keyboard to that and you are looking at additional 400 usd.


This comment sounds familiar…


Yeah I think the 11 inch Pro is not gonna get a direct successor. I assume the Pros are gonna be 12.9 and IDK 14 or something.


[deleted]


Yep its so crazy. So many people who drop an incredible amount of money on a 15/16" MacBook Pro or the Windows equivalent when all they needed was a MacBook Air or Dell XPS 13.


I mean ig the only market for a product like this would be someone willing to keep it for 5 or nore years- the better the hardware now the better its going to be down the road


Yeah right now my Macbook Pro M1 really just lives on my desk as a desktop and I use my iPad Pro M1 as my simple on the go stuff. I am definitely looking towards the new Mac Mini (the studio name is so stupid)


I'm actually looking to be one of those.

I only use my mac for media comsumption. Reddit, youtube, web browsing.

I simply want the best screen and speakers you can have. I don't care at all about power above medium spec. It's just so happens that that computer is the 16" Macbook Pro. 

I really wish they'd make a 16" Macbook air, with lower specs. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.


With the MBP you atleast have the option to use that power, whether users use it or not. Even if you tried you can’t really on the iPad Pro.


Haha, that was me two weeks ago. Realized it was a waste of money for web browsing and Netflix, so it went right back.


Why do you regret the M1 IPad Pro? I’m thinking of getting one


I tend to agree. I like mine, but really wish they’d just adapt macOS for their touch screens. The size increase from the 10” iPad it replaced was nice, but the M1 feels stupidly overpowered for mostly basic apps and even for some of the more cpu intensive ones. 

…the screen blooming bothers me far more than the OLED smearing too.


The only reason I’d choose the pro over the others is the mini led.


I don’t regret getting the iPad Pro M1 11” but the only reason I got it was for the quad speakers. Had the iPad Air gotten 4 speakers I would’ve gotten the iPad Air.


I think we'll see iPadOS and MacOS converge in the next year or two. The M1 iPads will essentially end up being Macs with touchscreen.


I always strongly recommend against getting the iPad, and always tell people if they’re considering an iPad, they have two options. Spend roughly about the same (after factoring in the keyboard) and get the MacBook Air, a much more capable device, or to save a bit of money and get a lower end Windows laptop or even a Chromebook, which are also more capable devices.
 
 
 
Frankly, unless you’re drawing, the iPad is a waste of money.


felt this, i think it may have been a bit overkill buying an m1 ipad pro for note taking and spreadsheets (and the occasional game via remote play when i’m away)

I would love if they added extended display support, solutions like shiftscreen aren’t cutting it for me no more


Same here. I regret not getting the Mini


Yea my biggest problem is the lack of a proper file management system.


100% agree.


iPads screen is superior and the airs speakers are trash , why would you watch Netflix on it


Well they won't announce any improvements to the OS till WWDC


Hmmmm I genuinly have no idea which one to get


I think the air’s touch ID is way easier to use


Speakers and face id is utterly useless when compared with a price point


OLED certainly not in the 2022 model, but maybe 2023 or 2024 yeah. They can't put Pro or Max inside either because of thermal issues, so expect M2.


No chance they put an M1 pro in the iPad Pro - it would get throttled significantly without a fan.


wrong. zero chance they put a higher TDP chip in the iPad Pro. base M2 chip, sure.

Apple wouldn’t offer it unless there was demand. If they released a product and only 1% of users bought the lowest storage option, then they would stop offering it. A large enough percentage of people purchase 64gb for Apple to continue offering it. 

You’re tired of people saying “well I don’t need more so it’s ok.” Maybe people are tired of you saying “I need more so it’s not ok.” Your complaining can go either way depending which side of the fence you’re on lol.


The iPad is the only product where Apple thought it was necessary to put an explicit disclaimer in the shop to consider future proofing your device by getting more storage. Apple is basically saying here's a great product, but even basic users should probably pay for the larger model *because we know 64GB may not be enough for many.*


Then get the higher capacity one? That's literally why it exists. 

What you are proposing is asking the people who would be in the market for the base-level iPad to pay more for storage they don't need. Increasing the capacity of the base model doesn't make 128GB cheaper, it makes the cost of entry higher.

You know that there are places without the stable internet or even without any internet connection at all, right?

I mean that Galaxy tab S8 ultra screen makes me think..... unclean things


Seriously. Either Intel/AMD/Microsoft need to get their shit together on a tablet Windows experience, or Google needs to get Android tablets moving again. Granted, appears to be some efforts on that latter one with 12L, but definitely not up to par yet.


No apple health, no wallet, not possible to pair with apple watch, no built in weather or calculator app.

We could argue these are better suited for phones but it still means it's less capable.


> upgrades means nothing to me for my usage

The 2018 iPad Pro 11" and the current model are pretty much identical for the vast majority of people's daily use cases.


Supply chain is the key word here i think. I'm not an expert but i've read that tim cook is a supply chain genius and the optimization he made on the supply chain is what enabled apple to become a multi trillion dollar company. Though the lineup is a bit confusing to the end customer, this is most likely the best choice to optimize the supply chain and ultimately save a bunch of money that turns into r&d, marketing and final profit. Apple knows that their brand identity is strong enough that the confusing lineup is not an issue to loyal customers who will buy anything as long as it's apple


Yeah. 

So they should take Final Cut Pro

Reimagine the interface for touch

And put it on the iPad


Thanks for the assurances 😂 just got my ipad air 4 last month for bare minimum uses and your comment put my mind (and wallet) at ease 👍


I think the only downside is that those will not get updates much longer, beyond iOS 15, right?


Chiming in as a user of one, I really couldn’t justify buying a new one this one got me through 4 years of uni and still works fine and battery still holds up pretty well. Yeah, bezels are there but I hardly use my iPad anymore.


They are just such wonderful machines. I could probably be without my iPad while I couldn’t be without my MacBook, but I also like using the iPad so much more.


I decided to swing for the Pro because ProMotion is a killer feature IMO and worth the additional $50

The halved storage size doesn’t bother me as I don’t plan on storing a bunch of things on my iPad

I’m also picking it up today which is a nice dose of instant gratification!


The screen air gap bothers some users.


Pro 11 inch doesn’t have mini led yet


Do you think that the prevoius IPad Air will be cheaper? 

I was planning to buy one, than they announced this new one with M1. And since there are almost no difference in price, I might go with the new one. I just really want to cut the price off, since it's too much for me as a student.


Same. Watching the stream on my mini 6.
Now I just don’t know if the mini is overpriced or the air is underpriced.


I’ve heard about that issue.  I was more thinking though that the M1 supports thunderbolt, so why not make it a thunderbolt port?  I think the reason there is to separate it from the iPad Pro.


A phisical shop in my country


I am not sure now.

64 gb of storage is too little. And 256 gb brings me into the same price range as the base model iPad Pro.

So for a bit more more than the 256 iPad Air, I could get Face ID, a better camera and pro motion.


Unfortunately bought it 28 days ago and I've used it lol, I mean it's still a great iPad aha but I thought it would have been more expensive


Wtf ! Wont that be like 3 times the cost?


Yea, I saw that afterwards, but I don't think those are such big downsides for me as I tend to watch content with my Airpods anyway and touch ID vs face ID isn't a big deal to me


[deleted]


I see that mentioned a lot but what impact does it have?


Oh I see how come the iPad Pro still have the better speakers tho? Are they just bigger?


Yep. Still okay for people to be disappointed though.


If people uninstall the apps they don’t use they will likely never go over 64gb since most thing have cloud save


> Depends, you must be a rather light user storage wise.

I doubt the average user has a ton downloaded, either. They're just using these things for Youtube, Facebook, and Netflix. Sure, some people are going to do photo editing or drawing or whatever but to most people tablets are still just content consumption devices


I’m not a light user by any means but all of my photos are in the cloud and I only have the essentials on my iPad so 64 is plenty 

I don’t like downloading apps for the sake of downloading them


I’ll be ordering the 64gb air. Replacing my iPad Air 2 64gb. Worked just fine for seven years lol use my phone for my data intensive things, and even then, only photos take up my storage. My new iPad will be a Netflix/streaming content device for me and my child. I have ps5 for games lol


Ok I thought I was crazy for not using 64 gb on my iPad. I also have photos on the cloud so the only time I download is for movies/shows on a longer trip


I bought an iPad Mini 6 as my first ipad, and I went with the 256GB version because I've never had one before, and I didn't want to end up shuffling and deleting apps, and having used it almost every day since I bought it, I've only used about 50GB on it. I have a couple games on it, but I primarily use it for watching videos and reading books, with some doodling in procreate here and there.


Yeah, it depends what you’re doing with it. I’ll be buying an iPad mini at some point strictly to act as a Home control panel, mounted to the wall beside my thermostat. I’d buy a 16GB model if they offered it. 


And on the other side of that, my phone is 512GB and my next upgrade will be a 1TB model, probably this fall.


Guys, Genshin Impact is 13GB and it's just one game. 

You gonna get an M1 and then delete every game you try?


Agreed, but still crappy they don't offer a base of 128.


But why would you need an M1 if you use your iPad primarily as a multimedia and browsing device? I still use my iPad Air 2 for those purposes that has an A8X and it works just fine, I don't see why you'd need a much more powerful chip if you're not about to do some photo/video editing or heavy gaming or something. If the iPad is only your 3rd device besides your iPhone and MacBook I really don't see the point to get this over the standard iPad which costs about half of this.


iMessage attachments take up space too


This. Got my ipad mini 256gb only to use it for one game and youtube.


I can agree on that. I thought about updating to the M1 iPad Air 5, but w/o having ProMotion, it is a no brainer to stay on the A14 Bionic iPad Air 4. Also only have 64gb version, and waaaay enough space on it. Just the display is so mediocre in scorlling....


[deleted]


It's the quad speakers for me. It makes streaming stuff without headphones from "this is alright" to actually listenable.


That’s my current IPad. Love the 120hz so much I can’t give it up.


12.9 in too. I know it’s not everyone cup of tea, but I need that screen real estate


Very


A 14 inch would be huge. The 12.9 inch is already pretty large honestly


What? No, for desktop monitors you can get 240Hz for sub $350 and 144Hz for like less than $150. 

High refresh rate displays for mobile devices aren't really that expensive either given that you can find $200 androids with 90-120Hz. Apple not giving the iPad Air high refresh rate has nothing to do with price and everything to do with Apple not wanting to compete with their more expensive iPad Pros. Even just a small bump to 75Hz would have been huge.


I'm probably one of these people. Pretty much the most intensive things I do are some very light video editing and some web/app development. I got a M1 Pro MBP. Why? I wanted a 16" screen. Had there been a 15/16" Air available, I probably would've gotten that


I feel like an ipad air with a keybaord is perfect for those people


I’m the guy who periodically buys a high spec MBP that I don’t really need typically because I tend to keep them for a long time.  I didn’t, however, buy an M1 Max 16” this time around even though it would be a great upgrade.  What I will most likely do is buy the next MBA release and go for longer battery life and more portability.

Other than my phone, the Apple device I use the most is this new iPad Mini I’m typing this comment on.


I’m pretty sure he’s talking about how it’s just too much for what the device is actually capable of. A MacBook Air can do so much productivity that an iPad can’t, so it’s fully able to take advantage of that powerhouse of a chip. Also the cost of MacBooks have gotten more affordable so if you’re paying similar amounts, a laptop makes a lot of sense.


The iPad Pro is a cool device but I bought the M1 12.9 at launch and I think it was just too expensive for what the device is capable of.  It’s an amazing device for content consumption.  If you need an iPad for drawing and stuff maybe it’s a great buy.  But for me it was too expensive for what I use it for.  And the OS is limited.


I bought an M1 iPad but I still go to my MacBook Pro for any real productivity lol

As I’ve learned in the worst of ways, a laptop is still much better for productivity flows than an M1 iPad


Same man. Regret getting my iPad as barely used it. My max on the other hand. Love it. Does everything I need and more.


I love mine
It’s all gas and *some* brakes

It’s only a tad faster in day to day things compared to my pre-M1 pro, but it’s graphics performance is noticeably better, and I also opted for the 12.9” with cellular this go around so it was a pretty big upgrade for me. 

The some brakes comes in as a “hey, sorry I’m being limited by my OS for parity with my siblings” because I know it’s capable of much more.


Well I’ll let you know I’m going from a pro 9.7 to a used 12.9 (5th) M1. I also have a 16 i9.


I doubt it.  They will improve iPad OS but it’s always going to be a separate device and OS.  They want you to buy an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.  If they make the iPad too good no one will buy a MacBook.


People have been saying that since the first iPad Pro


That is highly unlikely. Look at Windows for a prime example of how converging tablet abilities into a desktop OS that was never designed to do such a thing can lead to mediocrity all around. 

Now, I can see iPadOS inheriting *just enough* capabilities from macOS to make it more useful than it is right now, but not enough to where iPads would completely destroy Mac sales.


We've been saying this for years now and it still hasn't. It won't either because Apple's philosophy is to sell you more shit, not make your life easier now.


Yep I regret it.  I’ll probably keep my M1 12.9 pro for at least 5 years.  It does make for a great tv in bed device but otherwise I will never buy another iPad again unless the OS gets better or they allow side loading.  The fact that I can’t run any program I want on a device I paid over $1500 for with the magic keyboard is insane.  I feel like an idiot for buying it.  My M1 air is incredible though.  I love that laptop.


Disagree. I've had iPads since the original release. I'm now using a 10.5" Pro. iPads are superb browsing/messaging/research devices. They're not great document creation devices. 

A with any other tech purchase, start by evaluating your use case. Saying a Chromebook is "more capable" is meaningless unless you include for what use.


The base iPad is great for what it is (and the Air has some refinements over it) that a laptop wouldn’t be great for.

I use our base iPad for browsing, youtube, drawing with Procreate + Apple Pencil, ebooks, some of the kids online schooling, games, notes, etc. It’s a nice middle ground between phone or laptop. Bigger screen than phone, easier to tote around and use wherever than a laptop. I can let the (younger) kids use an iPad on the couch compared to never letting them breathe in the general direction of our MBA. Of course, that’s also a difference between a ~200 tablet and a ~900 laptop. 

If someone has some more money, the Air is probably the most iPad anyone needs. It can handle a lot of drawing (with magnetically attached and charging Pencil v2 plus the laminated screen) and USB-C charging for commonality with more devices.

The Pro iPads really seem more aimed at someone doing art full time for their career.

That being said, it certainly seems the best to have the right device for the job, but the iPad being able to cosplay as a computer with the whole trackpad/keyboard accessory is pretty cool. I could see college students who are just typing in online office suites getting away with it.


Good thing there’s even faster file transfer for the still shitty files app!


Air. Save money, people will always tell you to splurge but I’ll be the angel in the ear and tell you to save money


get the pro. it's 200$ for a decent amount of better/extra features: more camera, better display, more storage, more speakers, face id, possibly more ram


We'll see.


[deleted]


Apple is offering it because it makes the choice difficult and results in more revenue. The jump from 64gb to 256 is sufficient enough to make people put down the extra money, and the moment you do that, the 10 inch pro is round the corner for $50 more and with a 120hz display. Suddenly, the consumer who went in to buy a $600 device is spending $800.


> Apple wouldn’t offer it unless there was demand.

Bro, it's to upsell people on the larger storage sizes.


[Very few now. Hell, they can achieve 2MB from mars already, with 6MB capacity possible](https://marspedia.org/Internet#Communication_rates)


Yes, they have a lot of Bluray and books :D


The saving grace with the Ultra is DeX mode (desktop experience) which allows you to launch a bunch of apps at the same time and multitask.


I’ve been to the dark side. The apps are terrible. Trust me, the grass is greener here


I see. How about the iPad's window management, or being able to open more than one instance of an app. Or mouse support. Does that make up for the missing calculator?


Its so dumb that the macbook doesnt have touch screen. Like, come on. Who is making these decisions?

Theyre worried itll cut into ipad sales. Ffs. Once youve used a labtop with touch screen, you cant go back to no touchscreen. Its not about ipad shit, its just nice to be able to scroll with your fingers


Yeah there’s no point. iPados is so gimped we’re not even hitting the limits of 2018 hardware yet


Very cursory research suggests that i(Pad)OS 16 will continue to support the A10/A10X chips at the lower bound. So the venerable 10.5” would continue to get updates for another year at least. Guess we won’t know for sure though until wwdc.


I mean, the iPad Air 2 got iPadOS 15. The 2nd Gen Pro might get 2 more updates.


Oké Nice! I will also go for the pro! Enjoy yours 😁


Mini overpriced. I definitely didn't need to get the upgraded storage. Wasted like $200 on that


The lower-end 27 Inch iMac replacement is the Mac mini + Studio Display. The higher-end iMac configs will be served by the Mac Studio.


Because it’s the pro, some things are just better.


why? most people dont need 128Gb and if you do, just buy the 128gb version. its that easy and you can cry all you want, that is not going to change a thing. there is a reason why apple differential features between the air and the pro.


(The Year 2022 + justified existence of 64GB + Cloud Drive) is an unique combo of oxymorons.

I guess some people just like to keep paying Apple Tax for what they could actually own instead of renting.

I keep cloud usage to the minimal - only GPhotos & use my laptop for all backups.
Even GPhotos I plan to discontinue soon enough as got a micro NAS thing in plans. 

Combined with FileBrowserGO I got automatic backups scheduled for photos & essential folders on the iPad while the laptop does daily or weekly backup of all this to another drive connected to it automatically (via Macrium)

Pros:

1) Super fast backups & file transfers (>800Mbps) over wifi6 router at home without needing to pay ISP for faster Internet (100Mbps atm)

2) Backups done via 3uTools or iAmazing are quite fast, reliable & modular (App+ App data+ contacts/bookmarks/settings etc)

Cons : 

1)No automatic sorting & fancy stuff for pics from GPhotos.

2)Cat takes down & sabotages my drives. 

So I guess there’s either the Apple Tax or the Cat Tax… we can’t escape them at all!  xD XD


[deleted]


I have the 32GB 7th gen iPad and I am definitely running into some issues lol


Same here!  I almost didn't switch to an apple tablet because it had no microSD card. Since the pandemic I never really travel anymore so even the "local movies for travel" is moot. That said, I do like having the headphone jack so I hope this one lasts.


I don’t game on my iPad. And after one look of the art style of Genshin Impact… no thank you


I mean sure, but for most people buying the base model, it doesn’t make a difference.


why would apple offer a base 128gb version of the air that is targeted for average consumers? if you need 128gb, get the pro, its that easy.


I don’t need an M1. This iPad Air doesn’t make too much sense as an upgrade out of necessity. But if I was in the iPad market now, the M1 would be nice. But also not a deal breaker if not there. 

But you’ve really discovered the whole point. Most people don’t need anything beyond the base iPad. I bought the iPad Air because I preferred the no home button style, I had a lot of credit card points that could buy Apple gift cards at 10% off, and I’m fortunately in the position to splurge a bit. When it comes to my needs, the base iPad would have easily covered it.


Ok, but not 64GB. My unmanaged iMessage is taking up a whopping 1.72GB


What are you playing?


How do you like it so far? Mine is hopefully coming in next week!


What’s wrong with using one of apples phone chips though? Cheaper, less power, and won’t be limited if you’re just doing media consumption.


Me too. I bought the 2020 Air 6 weeks back, then swapped it for M1 11 inch, glad I did now!!


Especially since atm you only get the sweet miniLED display on the 12.9


Same reason I bought the 12.9” iPad Pro, I wanted the larger screen size.


In my opinion this is the biggest problem with Apple's current laptop lineup: There is no way to get a >15" screen without going into very expensive pro territory. I think there should be a 15" Macbook Air as a large screen is very nice for many otherwise very casual use cases (browsing, watching videos, text editing, etc.)


This. I’ve tried using an iPad as a work device a few years back and it just doesn’t work. And I’m sure the problem is exacerbated now that they’re throwing so much horsepower in there but without the fundamental blocks of getting the OS and software to a place where it could function as a work device. Just off tree top of my head, Files isn’t a Finder. Getting media on and off it is difficult. If you don’t have a keyboard and mouse, it’s going to take to 2x-3x longer to do anything simple. One port only is a problem.

I still maintain iPads are consumption devices.


This is why I bought the 2TB + 5G one. To store all my movies and music, and because I like not having to worry about staying connected when I’m away from home.


Exactly. The use cases of tablets and laptops are too different to be covered perfectly by one OS.

The main thing that seems to hold iPadOS back currently for more complex workloads is is file management, which could probably be solved with a better Files app and improved file handling APIs.


Totally agree. Only reason to get 120Hz seems to be gaming, but its not a pc, so yeah… My Air is doing its job doing everything a pro can. I don’t need Lidar, I just want to watch videos, read documents and use a little Procreate when I need it for uni.


What about a 2018 13inch pro vs this new air? I honestly can't figure out which one is worth it to get.


~~Why’s the display better? I thought the 11 pro has the same display as the Air’s~~

Never mind: there is promotion


not more ram, the air has offically 8gb


I don’t really have a source on this, but I have lots of apps on my 32GB iPad, including some games that are several GB each, and I haven’t run out of storage.


Apple knows 128gb is the sweet spot, hence them not offering it as a middle option, which is obviously what upsells the 256gb. But I was responding to the guy saying 64gb is a joke in 2022, which it isn't a joke. A TON of people buy the 64gb and are happy with it because they are "light" users and 64gb is ample. If they need a little more storage, they purchase some iCloud. If Apple only wanted people to buy the 256gb, then they would literally only offer that (duh!). But that would harm their sales because there is still a big demand for 64gb iPads.


Then why not keep 32 GB or even 16 GB as a base storage? Muh cloud can solve every issue!


They wouldn't, but if Apple had some kind of M1 Mobile phone with a screen the size of a Samsung Ultra phone that had a macOS DeX situation (and worked over Miracast). 

I would pay... so much money for that.


99% of people use tablets for media consumption, so apps are low on the list of priorities.  Besides, the popular apps run the same on both ios and android.  It's the less popular apps where you see the difference.


It sure does, it doesn’t make up for the other things though


NO.


Ah interesting, thank you.

I have the 2017 sitting in a drawer, have been debating on selling it (256GB cellular model).


I'm not upset at all, and am completely fine with 64 GB.

Different people have different preferences, and being upset with the price of the Air with higher configuration.

You say "just buy the 128 GB version". That literally does not exist. You cannot purchase a 128 GB version. Not an option. If 64 GB is not enough, you have to pay for 256 GB, which puts it into Pro pricing. So there's a large segment of people who either have to have far too little, or far too much storage. That's why people are upset, and it's valid.


or they game on the ipad. To name but one, genshin impact is 15GB by itself. If there are other gachas involved you can easily run though 60+ gb (genshin 15GB, Azur lane 8.7 GB, girls frontline 6.5GB, arknights 4.8GB, just to name those I have installed on my own device)


I don't understand why most people don't shunt photos to a NAS. It's vastly cheaper to buy external storage.


[deleted]


32GB is definitely terrible for an iPad, and I regret getting one for my mother. She only does basic stuff but even with all of her basic apps + photos it’s full all the time.


I have 32GB 6th gen ipad and I still have half of the storage space left lol. Although I only use it for note taking and PDF annotating and I store my files and notes on iCloud, so my ipad usage might be lighter than most?


Yeah.  A user either downloads a lot of media, or they don’t.  I have a lot of music on my phone, but this iPad has almost nothing on it.  (I mostly use this for casual web browsing, YouTube, and Reddit.)


I know everyone’s different. Mine is about 15 GB. I also have local music and books on the iPad. No photos though

At least for my usage 64 GB is cutting it close if I want to keep it for a couple of years.


Marvel future revolution.


Its great. I did sell it recently due to the jelly scrolling. I couldn't surf the web due to the scrolling. Playing games and watching videos was fine tho.


> What’s wrong with using one of apples phone chips though? Cheaper, less power

This is the same price as the previous model with an A15


Games.


to apple, that’s not a problem


It is that way by design. Not a bug but a feature.


You can always pair your laptop with a bigger display. I just found a discarded 7 year old 24” LCD for my still older mbp 2012, complete with wireless keyboard and mouse which are just about as old, and it almost feel like getting a new iMac to me. Poor man’s solution I guess.


For me work stuff is email, web based, office 365 (temas, SharePoint, outlook, word). I just got a used 5th 1tb 12.9 with MGK for 1300 I’m hoping it works better than my big 16 MbP.


[deleted]


I use my iPad for consumption and CAD. I’ve got the 9.7 iPad Pro. It does the trick for my CAD needs. I bet the M1 could make that a lot smother one day.


>	If you don’t have a keyboard and mouse, it’s going to take to 2x-3x longer to do anything simple

Compared to what exactly? Computers come with keyboards and mice, so if you're going to use an iPad as a work device instead of a laptop, why wouldn't you be using a keyboard and mouse? Especially with the Magic Keyboards being available. 

>	Files isn’t a Finder.

What is it missing exactly? Downloads go to the Downloads folder, docs go to the Documents folder, you can create whatever other folders you want and you can freely move files wherever. Any app that uses documents has access to these folders, and if you use iCloud storage then your docs and downloads even match your desktop. You can access SMB shares, import media from SD cards, connect and use external drives, tag files with the same tags as Finder, etc. a few years back I could see this, but at this point I struggle to see what Files is missing.

>	Getting media on and off it is difficult


You can send them over to the files app without any real work. Aside from normal file transfers, you can also Airdrop, plug in an external drive or card, connect to a network share, etc. This includes videos, photos, documents, and whatever else you need. While it's great for a work environment, for home use you could also just stream through Apple Music, Spotify, Plex, Hulu, iCloud Photos, Google Photos, etc. Could you clarify what the challenge is with getting media on it?

>	One port only is a problem.

If you get the Magic Keyboard you'll have two you can use. And since they're USB-C they can chain easily. Though I have to say, I've been using my iPad as my primary computer for a couple of years now and I've never really needed to connect a million things to it. You could also get a USB-C hub and solve the problem easily, but again I don't even know how necessary it is. 

>	I still maintain iPads are consumption devices

It is what you make of it. I personally consume a lot, but I also manage my unRAID server via Termius (SSH) and Files (SMB), ZenDesk stuff through Safari, home wiki through Notion, tasks through ClickUp (web app as it's miles better than the regular app and works perfectly in Safari), notes through Craft, longer form writing through Ulysses (though I'm starting to use Craft more exclusively lately), research and general knowledge collection through DevonThink, work chat through Slack, finances through YNAB (again using the web app), emailing through Fastmail (and Spark but the FM app and web app are a lot more functional), remote desktop via Splash (for my VNCed containers) and Jump (for my Windows VM that pretty much exists just to run ComicRack), and more. Again, what exactly are you not able to produce / create with an iPad?

Edit - I also forgot to mention that I prefer the multitasking on iPadOS more than MacOS. Regardless of which I'm using, 99% of the time I have my apps full screened. It's so much easier to swap out apps, split screen them, switch windows within an app, manage multiple full screened apps / spaces, etc than on a Mac. For example if I have two apps open in a split screen and I want to focus on only one, I can move the divider all the way to the side on iPadOS and it will pop the second app off in to its own space behind the scenes. You stay in the main app and just keep working. On MacOS you can't drag the divider all the way, you have to pull one of the apps out of full screen, then switch back to the space / app you were wanting to use on the first place. It's so much quicker and more fluid to use an iPad.


That, and a complete lack of apps which can properly use the power of the M1 chip. Hell, there aren’t many applications which can truly stress the M1 out on Macs at the moment!

I hate this narrative, 120hz is not ONLY for gaming. On the bigger iPad screen you will 100% notice the difference, 60hz is so ugly on iPad. If you’re not bothered by that then that’s fine but 120hz makes everything feel 10x more fluid. Plus if you’re taking notes on it, it will feel far more natural writing in 120hz rather than 60.


I have a 2018 ipad pro. 120hz is definitely great to have, and when I play around with the ipad air and mini in store, I can see the latency of the 60hz quite clearly. But I think the performance difference with the M1 is too big to overlook, especially given the price. ipad pro 2018 is nearing 4 years old now, so you're probably looking at refurb options as well as devices with older batteries. I think if you're not comparing side by side, ipad air is the clear winner.


The short answer is greed. It's *just* enough for people to be satisfied with it, but *just* too little compared to 256 GBs, so they can upcharge a 20 addition as $150. Like when I got my iPad a few years ago. $330 for 32 GBs or $430 for 128GBs.


minus 100 dollars, no problem for the 32GB. My air 2 with 16GB is rockin


Hell, if Apple can turn iPad OS into a functional DeX equivalent it would be nice. 

I find myself using DeX a ton with the S22 Ultra.


Onenote is a lot better on iPad


Except one are apps, and the other are actual features of the OS.

Because people don’t want tons of physical devices. Cloud storage for photos is mindless.


3 point backup system, local, external and outside your house.   
  
Plus most people don’t want to be bothered with setup a NAS.


Biggest reason for me that any sort of attaching drives doesn’t work on an iPad is because you can’t safely remove. Basically the only way that you can risk not damaging your drive or losing data is to do a hard shut down on the iPad every time you save some thing and want to it and attach it. It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen and can’t believe Apple has not figured this out with iPadOS and USB-C.


Files :) you can play video and music directly in the app off of any of your storage providers or even USB


I got both my grandparents 32GB iPads and they seem to be doing okay. They mostly just play games and Facebook. we got them small Samsung tablets the year before but as you could imagine they did not last. They were slow and just not great. I need to check their storage the next time I’m over to see if they are close to being full. I know I’ll get a call once they are.


Try the 16 go I got on my original iPad Air


Honestly the iPad Air 64GB is horrible and I only use to watch movies to go some apps like starz and showtime uses almost 10-15 GB for a season to go also the more you use it for music listening lately IOS 15 will say you have 8 GB of storage uses but no downloads have to constantly reset mine to factory for storage issues idk if it’s a bug in the IOS system but I know why they do it for the upsell but even the iPad mini and iPhone SE starts at 64GB now days apps are memory hungry all devices should start at 128 GB and the Pros at 256GB


I have a lot of games. I use it a lot for entertainment. The Pokémon card game takes up close to 6GB alone. So that’s where I run into my issue. I just ordered a 10th gen iPad 256GB and traded in my current iPad. I want to be able to save movies. I don’t have a laptop so the iPad is my laptop as well.


That looks fun. I forgot to see what’s outside of Apple Arcade.

I love my iPad mini 5 and pencil. The mini is the perfect in between - laptop and phone while still being easy to hold and carry.

Plus the pencil is so cool, I've gotten into drawing and writing again


Sure, but by how much? The Airs pen is doing a great job and I’ve never noticed -let alone had problems due to latency. I do get that a good experience has its value, which is what Apple is about, but in this comparison I’m not convinced it’s worth it


I have a Surface Go 2 m3 that I got because I didn't wanna wait for Tiger Lake, for M1, or even longer for Apple to never release a 2-in-1.

Besides that I have a 2013 i7 Haswell 11" MacBook Air, because it still pretty much works fine except for limited battery life and a screen that makes me think I'm going blind.

I got a S20 Ultra for the camera, for DeX, and because it would be a great phone/computer to keep on traveling with. It arrived lile March 8, 2020.

If the Go 2 were a little faster with a crisper screen, if Apple let macOS run on iPads, or if WayTools would just finally release TextBlade after like 7 years (for DeX), I would RUN to ANY of those being my only computer and DIVE into the ecosystem.


(NB: I've also got a new M1 Mac Mini that I'm playing with for a few months before it replaces a colo machine when I get back to the US.)


So It doesn’t matter that I can’t pair my Apple Watch to my iPad, or access my wallet because it’s not an app?


I'm here and I don't even remember what that acronym means. The lack of self awareness though..


I think that’s a better question for the people complaining that 64gb isn’t enough. They want an iPhone to hold all their photos when a NAS would be better, and they’re self-proclaimed enthusiasts, so they seem like the perfect audience for NAS adoption.


Mainstream apps do, but if you have to use any less than popular apps for work, good luck.


I was really excited when I saw the original iPadOS announcement, was really hoping for a comparable feature.


Has it ever mattered to you? Did you go to a concert or to pay and mistakenly brought the iPad instead of the phone?


Network Attched Storage


Like what? The gestures seem to be system wide.


This is very niche, but I have an iPad and an Android phone. If I could pair an apple watch with my iPad I would buy one in a heartbeat


Not at a concert no. 

But when I need to punch in my card info online, it would be nice not to take out my phone.It would also be cool to pay my balance from my iPad too

Or when I’m using my iPad to work out, it would be nice to not need my phone aswell.


Ahh, yeah. Yeah that's definitely gonna go over the average person's head.


Not all apps will treat the trackpad like a mouse cursor.  I have ran into many apps that I use to connect to PCs remotely but it simulates touches and not a mouse.


Can you see all the numbers of the card from Wallet? I can’t see mine. iPads and Macs support Apple Pay without Apple Wallet though, you can add the card on them like in the phone. Or install your bank’s app.

I agree that there’s no reason to not have the health app everywhere, Mac too.


I can’t believe apple still have products that only support the first gen pencil. It’s been 4 years since the second gen pencil was released. It’s like they’ve got a huge stock of first gen pencils they still need to get rid of


What’s the difference between the pen1 and the pen2?


[deleted]


LOL what’s up with the photoshop?


Of course, it's Apple. That's what they do..specially designed charger, specially designed headphones. I fucking hate the way they rip consumers off.


What's up with the clearly ms.paint cable? Why was the original cable removed?


Am I high or does the pencil charge wirelessly when sticked at the top?


Everything Apple is straight up asshole design. Samsung is turning into the same and most phone companies were the ones Apple copied and now they're copying Apple, but on the shitty stuff.


It's been financially beneficial to have never purchased anything Apple.


Are we really complaining Apple finally went USB-C now?


I think this iPad is for people who don’t use the pencil


okay but are they permanently switching to usb-c for everything now? bc thats kinda nice. im tired of the proprietary cable bullshit.


Splice and dice. If you know how to splice then splice an end off a type C and replace the bottom end with that.


[original post](https://redd.it/y9pduv)


This is a badly photoshopped/fake photo, ala Chinese knockoff Amazon listings. None of those objects were actually on the surface photographed.


Wait is this the pro? Cuz the new ipad air def can use the 2nd gen pencil cuz i got both for my wife.


They are releasing an apple pencil gen 1 that has USB C rather than lightning, the adapter is for people who want to use their existing apple pencil 1


Only Apple Pencil 1??? How on earth will you ever survive??? My god that must be absolute torture…


Don't worry I'm sure there's a $100 adapter from Apple that'll solve the problem


Probably also made to give consumers a bad taste for usb c and anything non lightning


While it is dumb, OP has intentionally misled everyone with this post by making it more dumb. The adapter comes with the iPad, and that cord is entirely unnecessary. The pencil plugs into the iPad itself using the adapter, or you just charge it via a wall brick with the also included cable.


Ipad air 4 is good 👍


STOP BUYING APPLE PRODUCTS!!!


Most of the Apple products are asshole design.


This looks straight up cropped


Why would you buy that over the iPad Pro? My 2021 12.9” is perfect and honestly I wouldn’t have any other iPad 

Except maybe a mini as a pocket notebook


r/FirstWorldProblems


Apple loves projecting to low income consumers that they are also low class.


Why yall still use this shameless stuff is beyond me lol.


Fuck Apple Always


So, buy Android and use a cheap ass stylus!


Apple is such. Scam


Just chill. It’s honestly insufferable that every time some progress steps forward and makes something slightly less convenient the whiners come out with complaints like this. You would obviously rather just have nothing ever change or get better. Look, you have a miracle of modern engineering that can look up any kind of porn and yet you’re crying that they haven’t updated the pencil yet to charge directly out of the device. Just chill. Relax. Don’t buy something if you’re just going to complain. Dear god you’re annoying.


Why did u buy it tho


I hate apple products but I own one for Foreflight while piloting.


You're making it look like it needs to be plugged in at all times which is not true, just when you charge it. The pencil also comes with the adapter (Female to Female) so you can plug it into any existing apple charger you would already own if you've ever used an apple product in the past decade, you don't need to plug it into the iPad to charge.


You have a specific problem and it's very easy to solve with stuff you already own.


I’ve gotten so sick of Apple lately. The only reason I have an iPhone is for iMessage. Apple knows that if they adopted RCS, tons of people would abandon iOS.


You know you can plug that into the wall, right?


It’s the only iPad that does it too.

Apple has basically made their once budget iPad useless. Might as well get a mini at this point.


Most Samsung stylus work without needing to be charged. Why hasn't Apple moved to something like this?


Still can’t calculator


Apple: No longer packs adapters to reduce environmental waste.

Also Apple:


When will people stop buying Apple products?


The new iPad honestly is such a waste of money and resources. 0 reason to exist


Baby's first dongle? Oh how the turntables.


Apples been the pinnacle of asshole design for a while now


Anyone who buys apple products is a clown

I cannot feel bad for anyone who buys this and mopes about the bad design. It should be expected.


Pen, apple, pineapplepen!


unnecessary cord. the new ipad comes with a tiny adapter that literally does the job, you wouldn’t even realistically notice a difference. apple has a lot of crap design, but berating for them for a good design decision is bullshit. moving everything to usb c is beneficial for everyone.


Apple products are so annoying lol.  < Samsung


"it just works"


Lol this is real, thought it was a meme to mock Apple but they actually did it.


I may be in the minority, but I seriously cannot stand Apple. From the clunky gesture-based iPad commands, to the bag of little cords you need for different versions, to the way they think they know more than you about what you want, I just can't understand it.  Apple is the epitome of what this forum is about.

Buy 🍎.  Get what you deserve imo.


Yet people still buy these awful products


Maybe in 2023 Apple will catch up to 2015 Samsung.


Lmao I dint know why anyone buys apple.


Fck apple. Fck Tim cook.


I mean, Apple is basically the definition of assholedesign


Thank god i have an ipad 9


An odd choice for Apple.


Why does the stylus have to be plugged in? If I need a precise poke I just use a plastic pen with the ink part pulled out


Could fall into r/anticonsumption territory


I was in the process of checking out for one these when I noticed the Apple Pencil option was specifically 1st gen. Noped right out.

The iPad Mini that was released *last year *has better specs and features than the “new” iPad.


like who designs this shit?


the usb-c cable isn't even real here... the wire is just a gray line using the pen tool and the ends are photoshopped in. also not even connected to the pen


They don't have to stop supporting the gen 1 pencil, just add support for the newer ones.


You know, Steve was a first class major asshole, but he just would not have tolerated this bs user experience.  He just wouldn’t


And it's got a camera bump. But at least you'll be able to lift it off a flat surface because you probably aren't getting your fingernails under those flat edges.


The HMS courage sails again


Stop buying Apple products.


Lol apple


Wait,  Apple sells a stylus that needs to be plugged in??


Not really anything new, just Tim Cook milking the market.

Actually this is proof Apple does not care about the environment one bit. Knowingly designing your new iPad to work with the old pencil is a different kind of planned obsolescence.


A lot of countries are banning handheld devices that have a different charger than USB-C. Unfortunately, the Apple Pencil is still lightning.


[deleted]


Apple fucking sucks. Quit buying their shit. 

You are literally feeding the biggest most shit company in the world when you buy their stuff. It is embarassing how much of the human race is obsessed with certain tech because of a damn apple shaped logo.


All Apple products are asshole design IMO. Bought an iPad 9th Gen for work recently, wanted to pair it up with Apple Pencil 2, good thing the shop keeper asked me what iPad I have because apparently Pencil 2 only works with iPad Pros.

Friend bought HomePod Mini. I tried connecting to it with my Samsung A75, apparently you can't. I asked it to turn on the bluetooth and it said I found a webpage go look at the iPhone to see the results ! At least Amazon Echo devices read the actual web search results AND they have bluetooth. What a load of shit for $150. If you want room filling sound, get a proper portable speaker that you can actually take outside with you.

On the iPad, if I want to install an app, it wants to read my fingerprint every time. If I put my finger on the reader before it notifies me that it wants to read my fingerprint, it will fail. I have to wait for it to prompt me, then put my fingerprint, then Ding. Then install an app after 5 seconds, it wants to read your fingerprint again. Who the fuck came up with this design?

Bought an Apple MacBook for a workmate, needed it to connect to 2 external computers. Apparently there aren't many hubs that support 2 external monitors with the apple device via Thunderbolt. Bought one for $200 and only that worked. The rest of the hubs we have at work only connect it to 1 external monitor. Connect 2 and you will get the same screen on both monitors. Everything within the Mac ecosystem has to be fucked up or what?


Why are people still buying Apple products?


I like the MacBook, but in general, Apple can s*** my d****


People buy iPads??


I still don't know how Apple gets away with terrible design and treating their customers like shit while raising prices and removing features at the same time. There's no reason why Apple products shouldn't have better specs at the price. I know they are efficient but there are things that can't be optimized beyond certain point like storage or ram.


You’re buying apple products why are you so surprised???

Everyone on the planet and their grandmas know that apple pulls this shit lol 

Doing research with apple products before buying them should be the first thing to do.


Then charge it on your iphone. Who cares.


Wait for real?


I think every morning an apple employee wakes up and someone pisses in their cereal so they make bad products out of spite.


I work at Apple and I’m genuinely ashamed of this. I apologize on their behalf.


Is anyone surprised?


If you bought all Apple dongles when iPhone X was released, that was more than the phone which was originally $1000. I don't know how much Apple dongles cost all combined now but that must be still so expensive.


That's how they make the BIG BUCKS BABBBBYYYYYYY!!!!


iToddlers BTFO! 😂

[https://i.imgur.com/Xn0jst3.gif](https://i.imgur.com/Xn0jst3.gif)


How do you get people to buy more expensive products? You make the cheaper products as bad and unlikable as possible.

The whole point of this mess to attract people into buying iPad Air or Pro.


Why am i not surprised 🤭


Hey, that's innovation alright...


God I hate apple


So there is a reason for this. Lemme explain. Many companies apple included, have surplus chips, screens, motherboards etc. they need to use them some how. so they mix some of the old with some of the new and create a "new" ipad release. its a "partial" update so its not a bottom up redesign but its how they get rid of the excess stock. it saves them a lot of money. Furthermore as manufacturing processes for a certain design of motherboard or other component gets more efficient the price of that part goes down dramatically. Manufacturing those old parts is a smart move when you are working hard to increase profit margins for your new product. lastly... they can sell a new accessory... so yay


Seems Jony Ive had some influence here.


Everything apple does deserve to be on this sub


taking the U out of USB


classic apple


Apple is asshole design incarnate.


While Apple does a lot of things great, sometimes I have a feeling they are intentionally fucking with people because there is no way someone does shit like this because they are incapable of doing it better. This has to be intentional.


Apple are such low hanging fruit for this sub (pardon the pun)


Apple is an Evil ... and Once you commit to your commitment you are in for life.


Ik it’s dumb


That’s exactly what I was thinking


That’s the weirdest thing about this, but my theory is that they did it because they see these iPads as being bulk-purchased by schools. They figure those schools don’t need or want to pay for the extra cost of the updated digitizer for Pencil 2. They’ll charge them in a cart or a station, so they’ll just have a separate plug for the pencils. That’s the only justification I can come up with for this. I have zero justification for why iPad Pro didn’t get the landscape camera feature that this entry level iPad has, but I do understand why they’d put that camera on the entry level iPad if they’re imagining it as a device to be purchased by schools for use by young kids who aren’t yet comfortable with a full computer yet

(Oh and about the warehouse of apple pencils: they probably would imagine those schools buying Logitech crayons, not apple pencils. Apple sells the Logitech crayon, which is designed for use by kids, and who just need a big stylus that’s easy to grip, not necessarily one with pressure sensitivity and fancier features.) 

It’s a strange product but that’s my read of it


It’s the base iPad, chances are most of the non-business/education users won’t need or even consider buying the Apple Pencil. Plus IIRC there’s something about the first generation pencils working on non-laminated screens but the second generation only working on laminated, so presumably flinging the adapter in the box for the first Pencil was cheaper than outfitting the base model with the wireless charging tech, magnets, and more expensive screen that the second generation would need, especially if Apple has data showing the usage rate of base iPad with Pencil versus without.


Lol, mine only uses first gen and I don’t plan on upgrading til it starts dying


Shit I have two of em. One lost in the house somewhere and another in my desk drawer. None of my devices support them…


How about they make them cheap for us poor folks then?

They ought to release a new model anyway.


I think the real reason is that they decided to design the new basic iPad with a focus on use in landscape mode because of the new iPadOS 16 Stage Manager multitasking system. Because of this they had to move the front-facing camera to the top-center of the screen in landscape, which is exactly where the Apple Pencil 2’s wireless charging/attachment system is located in the iPad Pro design. If you go to the [product page](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.9/) for the iPad and the iPadOS 16 [preview page](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-16/), you’ll see that pretty much all all the promotional pictures show the iPad in landscape orientation. They also added stereo speakers that are designed around landscape use and seem to be really pushing the Magic Keyboard Folio as a key accessory. What this says to me is that they’re basically pushing people toward using these next generation iPads as convertible pseudo-laptop substitutes, a la the Microsoft Surface, which didn’t allow them to leverage the Apple Pencil 2 hardware.


Hi, Apple inventory analyser here!
We do!


Apple seems to be actively downgrading their bottoms line devices of late. Even the iPhone SE would have the same processor as the newest iPhones but the iPhone 14 now doesn't.


let me tell you about lightning port


They’re not gonna throw them out. I suspect this is also to say fuck you to EU trying to force charging port changes before apple is ready to do them for reasons exactly like this.


That's exactly correct


Exactly my thoughts, and that of the verge.


iirc pen2 is more sensitive and accurate, also charges wirelessly on the side of the ipad.


Pencil 2 only works on iPad Air and Pro, it charges wirelessly by sticking it to the side of the IPad. It’s honestly amazing, and it’s the only reason I paid more for an iPad because all of the models are basically the same.


I’m waiting for pen15 to be released


basically apple pen gen 1 is 7 years old and has a male USB lightning adapter, while the apple pen gen 2 is four years old and charges inductively on the iPad.

basically it has no adapter and sticks to the ipad via magnets, which charges the apple pen gen2

Remember this?

I have never used an apple device, and I never plan to (afraid of falling prey to the ecosystem), but I must admit, they are ***really*** good at advertising their stuff. It all looks so fancy.


It's worse than just dongles. 
Every time people talk about how great Apple ecosystem is and how everything works with everything seemlessly I start to question either mine or their sanity. 

WTF are these people talking about? The whole "ecosystem" is deliberately designed to require as many different devices and accessories as possible to just work. Different chargers for different devices. Different dongles for different purposes. Different OSes for LITERALLY the same hardware (M1 Macs and iPads)... It's not an "ecosystem", it's a walled garden. 

Some of the limitations are just infuriating. Here are just a couple of examples of bullshit I am dealing with right now:

1. I've got AirTags, and they are a great idea. I needed to reprogram them after getting rid of my iPhone and... it can't be done. I have an M1 macbook that should be fully capable of accomplishing the task. It has all the hardware required. It's just that Apple won't let me. You need iOS device for that because... reasons. 

2. Apple made a big deal out of M1 Macs being able to run iPad apps during their announcements. And then they don't make even their own first party iPad apps available. It's literally "having their cake and eating it too". How cool would it be to be able to use both versions of GarageBand on a single device? Well, no, Apple won't let you, because you wouldn't need to buy more devices this way. 

It's like Apple fansboys live in some alternate world where more limitations and needing to buy more devices for simplest of tasks somehow means "better ecosystem".


Dongles make dollars!


Love this “argument”… as if all devices that only have USB-C ports don’t also need adapters for everything.


[deleted]


I know it's a debate that will never end, but as a guy who has only ever bought Android products, it seems like what has always made me steer clear of Apple is just getting worse with each new generation of products


I'm calling it now, when apple is forced to move to USB-C they're going to release an iphone that *only* uses magsafe, and they're going to sell it with a magsafe puck with a USB-C port and *not* the USB-C cable. And it's only going to support 5V charging unless you buy an apple-branded USB-C cable with their own proprietary fast charge standard.


Probably found a pic online and wanted to show why it's bad instead of just the title


i can’t believe i didn’t even notice


Apple themselves is less of a problem (still a big problem though), what's more of a problem is their consumer that keeps buying their shit, if there's still a consumer, they'll still do shit like this and get away with it, and if something like EU demands USB C never happened, Apple won't care for a little bit.


They rip off developpers too! Its impossible to debug anything on their non standard stupid Safari (The new IE) without an IPAD and a mac connected to it. Its ridiculously blocked for no reason from PC and have a bunch of "surprises!" in their implementation that'll seriously fuck your code up. 

Then if you ever want to go native you need full stack MAC from a to z and that means double source code for all things implemented differently in a different languages and being generally more than double the work since pursuing 2 different know how to reach your goal. 

Its impossibly hard to maintain both as a very small teams so are most projects so you end up mac only if you bought the cool aid or everything else BUT mac. 

Now you have the rise of Javascript application everywhere, Ms Teams, Slack and other terrible memory hog. Because its the only way to have multi platform application nowadays. 

I'm telling you, Apple is to blame for everything being javascript, needing 3x memory, nearly 2x more cpu and eating up the worlds battery and energy. 

They are pure evil.


Bluetooth is Apple proprietary? I had no idea


The headphones are very useful. Expensive, but hassle free (most of the time).


Have you seen their profits on peripherals and cables?  I believe I read it was in the thrice commas range.


Their consumers absolutely fucking deserve it at this point. When the vast majority of buyers buy the phone as a status symbol(although they are good fucking phones), you give the makers the ability to fuck around, because they won't find out. Half the stunts that Apple pulls, you could never even imagine Samsung pulling them, at least not without a strong precedent.


Luckily with the coming in new EU law USB Power delivery is going to be mandatory. The EU is going to rip Apple's behind really hard in 2024, also with other EU laws (iOS browser engine monopoly and other things). Apple is going to be in a world of pain because of us Europeans lol 😂😆


Ohh, but their customers *love* it!


OP went out of their way to remove the cable that was maybe too long or didn't fit in the image and drew one with a very similar color for us to comprehend better.

OP doing a better job at communication than Apple's  ^^fine ^^print

Pencil 1 doesn’t do that.


Apple can't just let you buy their cheapest tablet.

If you want to use the second gen pencil with wireless charging on the side of the tablet, you'll have to buy the 650$ Ipad air instead of the 350$ one.

The pettyness of this is mind boggling, just get rid of the stupid first gen pencil already.


There are two Apple Pencils. One charged and attached magnetically, and older one charged like that.

Apple Pencil Gen 1 had an extremely stupid design before the dongle. If anything, this dongle make it's easier, but you don't get points for solving a problem you've created.

Apple Pencil Gen 2 "solved" that issue by charging wirelessly, but it created a whole set of other issues: there is no off button, so the iPad will happily discharge itself to charge the pencil. Gen 2 also will stop charging if it's been fully discharged (i.e. it went to 0% and stayed there for too long because 0% isn't actually 0% in modern electronics). The only way to power it off is to unpair it, so pencil goes into "fresh out of box" mode.

There are cases for Gen 2 pencil that keep it charged, but now you have to charge 3 devices.

iPad (basic version) only works with Gen 1 pencil. Newer iPad Air, iPad Pro and iPad Mini work only with gen 2 pencil.


I loved Google's first Pixel XL, but they immediately did the same shit on the next model. I ended up using that phone for over 6 years.


Samsung’s new privacy policy is *nutty*. Your devices are actually theirs, and you just pay to borrow them. Samsung phones especially report everything to their masters.


Apple "pioneered" pretty much every shit smartphone trend from non-removable/replaceable batteries to headphone jacks.


Which phone company did Apple copy?


Google has been morphing into the same with their first party products.

Pretty much all of the high end Android market is trying to capture some iOS's 75% profit share


Samsung is copying some of apples bullshit (no charger with phones, reserving some stuff to work only with samsung products) but they dont even play in the same league of consumer fuckery. 

Also samsung has plenty of amazing great value products and offers tons of deals all the time and is actually still innovating. Apple is just squeezing evryone dry while suckers still pay twice as much for boring ass products.

I can get 2 s6 lites ne for the price of 1 ipad 10+pen. On sale i can get a brand new pixel 7 pro + side pixel 7 for the price of 14 pro max. Apple is out of their fucking mind.


If you specifically need an ultra light laptop that just works, the MacBook Air is still pretty good. Besides that, I don't see the appeal anymore.


Not actually true. Apple products retain their value much better than other products in their category. They also receive 5+ years of software updates most of the time. Plus they are often the right tool for certain professions.

Edit: lol the user above blocked me for the crime of not following their narrative. Doing so right after posting a bizarre accusation that didn’t even fit into the reality of what I actually said. Super weird.

To reply to the user below:

As someone who develops software for a living, no, it’s not. I’ve used Windows, MacOS, and Linux. I prefer MacOS, especially for iOS and MacOS app development where it’s all but required.

Many graphic designers also find that iPad Pro works best for them. Some Apple haters like to push this narrative that they know the needs of professionals better than themselves, but it’s not true.


Except their stock.


I’m a software engineer forced to use windows due to the tech stack I use. My $3000 windows machine that is 6 months old runs worse than my $2000 2016 MacBook Pro. One of my teammates transferred just to get a MacBook lol. It’s infuriating how shitty Windows is for development.


Last product I had from them was a beige PowerMac G3 that I got in 1998, just before they came out with the iMac and the blue and white G3 mini-tower.  Within a year of getting it there was some problem with the motherboard which was covered by the warranty, and I had to go through absolute warranty hell to get it fixed because they kept flat out denying ever making a beige G3, what at the time was literally their flagship product a year earlier.


The complaint is that they half-arse it by using their older generation pen that requires a lightning port to charge, which makes no sense. Except of course, that apple is cutting costs on a tablet that they heavily increased the price of compared to the old model.


>they went usb c on like 3 products, which also ruins their old ones in specific situations like this

To keep it short, it makes no sense to still use the apple pen gen 1 (7 years old), which has some big flaws, when the apple pen gen 2 (4 years old) exists.

I would even go as far and say, that they are trying to get rid of their current apple pen gen 1 stock.


There’s just as many people who will hate and buy everything apple does ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


This thing could come with a $100 bill printer in it and people would still be outraged.


they went usb c on like 3 products, which also ruins their old ones in specific situations like this


The complaint is they're intentionally crippling the iPad, making it incompatible with Apple Pencil 2, in order to sell the more expensive models (iPad Air/Pro). 
 
It was already unacceptable doing that a generation after the Pencil 2 was out, but the fanboys kept defending that decision. 
 
Now it's just ridiculous.


No, we’re complaining you can’t use the Pencil 2 on it. And the solution for using Pencil 1 is convoluted.


The complaint is that although their newest iPad is USB-C, their 2nd-gen Pencil/stylus does not work with it (which uses no wired connection and charges wirelessly on the side of other iPads). However, the 1st gen Pencil _does_ work...but its connector is a lightning connector, so you have no choice but to get a lightning-to-USB-C adapter to charge it on your iPad.


you can't read?


My ipad pro has been USB C and I purchased it a few years back. Not surprised. My work laptop is a MacBook pro and it also charges via USB C. In fact it doesn't have a lightning port on the damn thing.


The complaint is that they're still a shitty company.


I feel like I’m missing something.  I’ve used an iPad for over 7 years and never needed a pen for anything I do.


I'm surprised I had to go this far for this comment. Despite the fact that Apple advertises the Pencil with all of their iPads, I don't think the vast majority of people use one, so it kind of makes sense to have a cheaper iPad that doesn't have the more expensive parts to support charging it. 

Though, it would be a lot better if they didn't advertise supporting the pencil so much.


There's a chip inside the adapter that converts usb-c signals to lightning. You can't just make a cable it won't work.


No it’s the budget iPad replacing the $329 that still has the home button, the one that most people who buy it aren’t going to get the Pencil for it anyways.


That’s not quite true to my understanding, they’re just putting a USB C and lightning adapter in the box with all of their Gen 1 Pencils now I believe, based on checking the online store.


It’s $9 and it comes included in the box


Sorry you’re wrong. The adapter is two female ends. You need a cable to plug it into the iPad. So the steps to charge your brand new Apple Pencil with your brand new Apple iPad are:

1.	Remove Apple Pencil cap (hope you don’t lose it)
2.	attach adapter to pencil
3.	plug cable into adapter
4.	plug other end of cable into iPad 
5.	profit


[deleted]


This adaptor doesn’t ship with the iPad. It ships with new Apple Pencil 1s (released 2015) shipped after 2022. Someone who bought this iPad and has a pencil from an old iPad would have to buy this adaptor.


Good way to break the pen if there's no cable.


Isn't it cheaper?
idk but they wouldn't be selling it if there wasn't demand for it


Or a good tablet with stylus, like those Samsung ones. The cheap stylus are always terrible


Apple fanboy logic: Apple does a bad design? Suggest an Android alternative that's 1/5 the price and compare it.


[deleted]


The problem with Android is that there's so many different products to choose from so you have to actually use your brain to decide which product suits your own needs the best.  This is an issue for people who prioritize having the better versions of the exact same stuff their friends have.


Their hardware has made me an order of magnitude more than it ever cost me


It's not even their budget model anymore. It's like an iPad Air lite. They increased the price and are keeping the last gen model as their budget option.


Apples has buttons, as well as a censor's for pressure so you can make the writing bigger or smaller automatically. They don't just use a piece of plastic of about the same quality as my 3ds stylis.


[deleted]


haha it was not a "design-decision". the decision was to still sell gear in europe or not. they were forced to adopt usb-c


The Apple Pencil requires a lightning port to charge it, the iPad it goes with only has a usb-c port requiring the use of a dongle to make it charge, there is a new version (released last year or the one before) that is usb-c and could have been charged directly but for some unknown reason compatibility hasn’t been built into this model


Only the first gen one. The second one can charge wirelessly when connected magnetically to the ipad I believe. Granted, the second gen can only be used with certain, higher end iPads like the Pro and Air.


nah people are obsessed with it because they make some pretty good stuff.

m1 macbook air? outstanding. best overall device for the price.


What's the need to censor yourself, we have the brains to count the asterisk, and figure out what you meant, so what's the fucking point in doing it?


Yes. Have more good programs compared to android tablets.


Apple fans buy iPads. Jury's out on their status as "people"


I think they mean the ipad has a USB-C port but you can't use it for charging.


pencil 1 has a male charger if it had a port then no one would really care but it needs a new adaptor just for charging


Not at all


It’s pretty clear that’s not all you don’t know.  What the hell are you whining about?  All of the dongles for a phone made 5 years ago cost over $1000?  Which dongles are you referring to?  There was a dongle that allowed you to connect your old wired headsets to the lightning port, which was included in the box, or additional ones could be purchased for $19.  And then there was the dongle that…hmm…I’m drawing a blank here.  Can’t think of any more dongles.  Where are you getting the additional $981 from exactly?


I think they did it this way to annoy you enough to get the iPad Air instead. They also conveniently didn’t add a 128GB variant which is just enough for most users. If you don’t want a 64GB variant, you’ll have to get the 256GB which is already the same price as the iPad Air. 

It’s all a ploy to make cheaper (not exactly cheap in this case) devices look less attractive to upsell their more expensive stuff


I think it’s because they designed it around the new Stage Manager multitasking system in iPadOS 16, which is best used in landscape orientation. Note the photos in the promo material [here](https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.9/) and [here](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-16/). Due to this, they moved the front-facing camera into the place where the Apple Pencil charging coils are in the iPad Pro. Since it can’t leverage the wireless charging, they just left the compatibility with the more simplistic, cheaper original version of the Apple Pencil. You may not be totally wrong with it being, in part, related to educational sales, as well. When paired with the keyboard folio, which they’re also pushing hard this cycle, it makes the iPad into a more computer-like experience, so school kids don’t need real laptops.


Probably the most realistic answer


And mini*


Dongles on dongles on dongles. 

**Dong**


They did think different — different adapters for different devices


I clicked that link hoping it would be this video. I haven’t seen the dongles one yet - it’s one of the best lmao. I laugh every time I see one of these


Funny how they mention removing the headphone port. 
When I got my new iPhone my disappointment was immeasurable discovering I couldn’t even use the charger, the usual usb end was swapped for some kind of usb c … meaning I can only use it if i buy their special plug (not included)


That cracked me up. Thank you


My favorite risitas

The fact that there is an ecosystem doesn’t not necessitate that the ecosystem in infallible. There are many parts of ecosystem that do work well. 

The general continuity between the Watch, phone, tablet, mac and tv. The fact that reminders, notes, messages, clipboards, podcasts, contact etc all sync between them in very nice.

The fact that this all works with family management is very nice.

Being able to start something on one device and pick back up on another is very nice. 

Being able to go out with family and take pictures on my phone, then get back home, turn on the Apple TV and look at the together without any other work involved is very nice. 

Getting a phone call and being able to answer it even if my phone is in a different room is very nice.

Being able to put on a pair of headphones and jump between devices which out having to manually change the device output on each device is very nice. 

Downloading an app on my iPhone and then having the app ready for me on an iPad without having to manually download it myself is very nice. 

There are just a bunch of small features Apple’s added over time which add value over time which result in my enjoying their ecosystem.


I get what youre saying, but I think most people are talking about syncing between devices when they talk about the ecosystem. Notes, messages, icloud etc. All work extremely well. I have an android and am switching back when they get usb c because I miss how seemless everything synced together.


Samsung phones and tablets are now getting 4 years of os and 5 years of security updates

edit: [more information here](https://old.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/y9w4k7/the_new_ipad_10_that_has_a_usbc_port_but_can_only/it91mq3/)


The Galaxy Tab series is pretty solid in terms of quality and updates.

My S7+ is, subjectively, about 80% as good as an iPad Pro and only cost me $370 (their sales are crazy).

If I had more money I would still opt for Apple, but Samsung is not a bad choice.


I had a Samsung Note tablet....got it back around 2014 and after like 2 years it was not getting updates.  I wanted to use the United app to watch movies on a flight and couldn't even download it.  Paid like $200 and sold it in perfect condition for $50 and was glad to be rid of it.


100 percent like this.


That looks like 100% home made by OP.


This could totally be an amazon page for the usb cable xD


Part of that is that there is certain software that has become industry standard despite only working on mac.  In live theater the audio and now some of the lighting systems are typically controlled using a program called Qlab, and since it can't run on anything but mac, every theater has to have a mac and all the dongle junk to go with it.


Every time Apple does something to get larger margins of profit, they cite certain excuses as to why they are justified. Countries need to be more like the EU and demand their products follow a certain standard. EU is like a slap on the wrist for Apple, I wish more countries like the US would step up like them and make Apple change their motto because their motto has been way too profitable for far too long.


Co-workers complain about spending so much on phones and dongles like it's the only option available to them.. Idk what to even say anymore so I don't try


[deleted]


The EU demanding that Apple change their port is not a good example of what you’re trying to argue. That demand is, in my opinion, quite stupid. It sets a precedent for the EU picking and choosing what new innovations are acceptable and what aren’t. The market can do this just fine, there’s no need to interfere with it. 

Imagine a new cable and port that needs to have different geometry from the current USB-C to allow for better data transfer speeds, power delivery, etc. Maybe it’s developed by a company like Apple that likes to keep their devices proprietary. The fact that the EU can step in and outlaw that new product, while citing inconveniences for people who don’t have compatible devices, is pretty dumb.


They want their sheep to be mad about USB-C, I guess.


American customers. FTFY. Their balls are so tightly held by Apple that even if there are better products out there, moving out of the walled garden isn't any easier.


It has everything to do with Apple misleading customers into believing their phones are better. I kid you not, as a phone sales rep, the biggest reason people stick with iPhone BY FAR is the stupid green text bubble/FaceTime bullshit. Apples ecosystem is so obnoxiously restricted, they were just lucky enough to be the first to market it right.


Apple deserves plenty of criticism for their business practices but this isn’t a great one.

Sure, you need Apple hardware to develop on their platform and that’s a huge barrier for lots of people, but you don’t need a separate device to debug macOS Safari besides a Mac itself. You can also run the Xcode simulator to test how it runs on an iOS device and use the same debugging tools. 

Not sure what you mean about “full stack mac a to z”, practically nobody is running Swift on servers. Most native Mac apps talk to the same Node/PHP/whatever REST APIs as everything else, but sure Apple does provide developers with cloud services supported by first party APIs for FREE. Shame on them for that I guess. 

If you want to go native you’re going to have to do extra work, no matter the platform. Same deal with a Windows .NET app, Android apps, consoles, etc. There’s still other platforms with native frameworks that take effort to support, that’s WHY we have more browser based apps and Electron apps all over the place. 

It’s hardly Apples fault to have had the audacity to build a platform too. If anything they do way too much to cripple the functionality of web apps on their platforms to force people into the native experience they control, which is the whole reason people complain about Safari being “non-standard” and “the new IE”.


> for everything being javascript, needing 3x memory, nearly 2x more cpu and eating up the worlds battery and energy.

I thought I couldn't be the only one who thinks all this html in "desktop apps" bullshit is basically developers externalizing cost onto users as energy costs, batteries dying faster, etc.

But to be fair, this movement is also due to people being web devs and being like "oh wait im a desktop dev too now". Many of these "apps" are web + desktop and "why not" use the same code

Just so it ends up looking native NOWHERE.

Also why exactly does Apple need their own graphics API (Metal) that only runs on their shit? Vulkan too unsophisticated for them? Nah. It's all about strong-arming people to dev for them and then being unable to take any code anywhere else


I needed to implement Apple Pay on something recently. To get access to the sandbox for testing you need an Apple Developers account and pay them £79/year. To get a developers account up and running you need an Apple device.


http://www.its-not-its.info/


I just wanted to play with php and get hit with "its already installed" to "it was discontinued" to here's how to install xampp and when you have problems they comments say just install brew then you install brew and try to edit the httpd/conf.d but in mac you cant just show hidden system files and edit the txt you have to go to the terminal and edit with vi or nano. Then in vs code it wants to know the location of the php files but you can't just get the path from finder because it's hidden, back to google and hope the response isn't from 2016 because that will lead you down the wrong path of info. Fuck man. Just a waste of time. Every error has so many different comments on what to do ends up being a waste of time. Hop on pop os and bing bang boom it's working.


Babe you double posted


wow. my $30 "GooJoDoQ"-brand stylus does wireless charging on my ipad mini.


Pencil 1 doesn’t do that **on purpose **.


It's not pettiness, it's _capitalism_.


The 350 dollar ipad does not exist anymore, tbey raised it to 450 i believe.


There is extra hardware they have to put in and that costs money. If their goal was to make a cheap iPad then yeah they might throw out the whole wireless charger on the side and any extra tech needed for the pencil


Want the best wireless earbuds on the market? No prob, airpod pro is there for you. Want to configure them? Want to update the firmware to fix a critical bug?

You better have bought enough apple to do that, if not you're stuck with default and no updates.

Airtags, huge threat to Android users cause unless they have an app open and running, they will never know they are being tracked.

You can't just dip your toes in the ecosystem, they make it as rough and unpleasant as possible until you go balls deep into their ecosystem.

Don't even get me started on leaving the ecosystem... Granted, it's excellent and works well together, but it's there to milk you for every penny you have. That 5gb free iCloud is full by the time you finish setting up your new iPad.


Apple and Samsung are one and the same. Apple does something, gets public flac. Their customers throw their money at them then Samsung does it but goes. Well, the market is already there, so you know.


Dude... I am really happy with my ipad air. It's the one before the switch to the M1 chip or whatever. So I don't get some of the new window management, but I can do my fake ass bob ross paintings and charge my pencil on the side. This is just bullshit. I think I grabbed it for like $450 or something.


The new ipad 10th gen gives me iphone SE vibes.


None of those gen 2 "problems" are actual real world problems. If you don't want to wirelessly charge something, don't put it in the wireless charging spot


Pixel 1 was best Pixel. Everything went to shit after that. Hell, even the Pixel 1 ripped off iPhones with the design but at least it still had the jack.


The first pixel and the one plus one. Now these big market shakers are just an other big budget brand.


Also, you know, most of the non-shitty ones too.  

But Apple bad, so…


I used to stick to Android because of this… but they all just copy them so what’s the point?


In the hardware sense, no one. However, iOS has done nothing but copy Android for years. Widgets, live wallpaper, biometric login, etc


At the start, none. Now they are copying anything they see from Samsung, OnePlus, Google, or anything really. Widgets and customization for example were copied from most of these.


Or a consumption tablet. iPad cannot be beat. 

Want to create, edit, use files etc? Look elsewhere


the m1 macbook air is the best laptop you can get for the price


Always owned macs, never bought new. Love my MacBook Pro except for the stupid keyboard.


iPhone's are pretty good


Yeah I love windows but my work Macbook has been nothing short of excellent. I'll never convert but I understand it now.


Right, a 14" Air is only $1,200-$1,400, where as to get an equivalent Chromebook, you'd have to spend nearly $190.


Just a typical Apple bad thread, what’s new. Apple products for the most part are pretty competitive with other products of the same class. Of course they do overprice some things, not denying that at all, but this weird narrative that everything Apple makes is like 500% more expensive than everything else is just weird. 

Apple’s flagship iPhones have started at like $700-800 for a few years now all the way up to $1100. Technically it’s $600 now since the 14s are basically the same as the 13s. 

Decade year old macs are still being sold for hundreds of dollars, meanwhile flagship android phones lose half of their value a year after they drop. 

Right tool can be subjective, idk too much about that but from what I’ve seen personally, Macs seem pretty popular in audio and creative workflows. 

I can’t imagine actual professionals will spend their money on something they know will hinder their workflows but I guess the Redditors will tell them what’s best for them



>I prefer MacOS, especially for iOS and MacOS app development where it’s all but required.  

Apple deliberately not providing iOS development tools for windows is not really an argument in their favour.  

Really the only apple product that provides anything unique without arbitrarily restricting or walling in it's users is the ipad line.  There is no tablet hardware and software ecosystem that has ever come close.


The right tool argument is mostly a marketing thing.

I hate developing on Windows. I seriously don’t understand how people can work in .NET shops


You assume everyone wants a pencil. Some.people just use the tablet. Crazy


Pen 2 is another technology that would make it even more expensive. In that case it's better to support Pen 1 instead of nothing I suppose.

Edit: compared to other tablets there's also not a single tablet that comes close when comparing pricing to performance. I agree it's increased, probably also due to inflation, but it's not overpriced.


Oh it’s worse than that. Lightning is how the Pencil *pairs with the device*. You want to pair your Pencil with your new iPad? LOL DONGLE


Better than nothing?


I'm not going to sit here and try and say Apple doesn't have some asshole pricing out there, but I think it's incorrect here to label this as "intentionally crippling".

The two generations of pencils use entirely different software and hardware for charging and pairing. It would increase costs (and potentially create other issues, potentially not) to support both methods in one device, so one or the other was chosen. The other tablets you mentioned also only support one and not the other, there is not a tablet which supports both. You can argue that they should have supported both but I think it's disingenuous to assume they did it to "intentionally cripple" one of their flagship products. If it supported the gen 2 pencil and not gen 1 we'd have the same posts about how it forces people to buy the much more expensive new pencil.


“Convoluted” aka buy a $9 adapter and plug it in? Alternatively, you can just plug it in and charge it with block.


Pen 2 is another technology that would have made it even more expensive.

I guess Pen 1 is better than no pen.


A lot of us college students have started getting iPads and pencils cuz it’s easier to organize notes, less stuff to carry, and less paper going to waste.

Also digital art has gotten more popular over the last few years, so many digital artists use the app procreate and use the Apple Pencil for drawing


I used iPads for years without a pencil, it wasn’t until I needed to mark papers as a teacher with my finger, where I started getting repetitive stress injury that I got a pencil


Oh… so why are people so upset then?


There is literally no proper solution in the box, the cord they provide is female to female lol.


It's nice that they include the crap solution to the problem caused by thenelves


Oh damn, you’re right. I could have sworn it was one male and one female, but you’re right.

Then that is absolutely stupid.


Why not just leave the adapter plugged in?

Just plug in the pencil with the same charger as you use to charge your iPad


Can you buy a female Lightning to male USB-C adapter and plug directly into the iPad?


I mean tbf the first gen pencil is meant to be charged from a cable not from the ipad, but its still dumb because you do need to go through all those steps to pair it at least.


Life uh, finds a way


Spot the homophobe


But why go cheaper. 

Like if you’re going to spend the money in the first place you may as well save up the extra couple hundred or so to buy the better one otherwise you’ll spend your whole time owning it regretting the fact you didn’t


"We had this skilled photoshop artist try using Windows instead, he was not impressed with MS paint"

Did you try running Photoshop on Windows?

"Why? That's what Macs are for"


Or suggest an Android alternative that’s 9/10ths the price and half as good.


I took that as just buy something cheaper instead of something overpriced. But to get a dunk on apple on reddit will always gain you karma, so good for you I guess


Same logic Apple detractors use all the time, so why not?


You.just haven't practiced even!


Those are solid facts!.


It’s a bold move by them since the software is fucking ass these days. M2 processor in an iPad for what reason?


Which are?


Apple has been willingly transitioning their products to USB-C for years now well before the recent decision.  This change has absolutely nothing to do with being forced to do anything by anyone because a) that law doesn’t take effect until the end of 2024, and b) devices like this take time to develop, and since that law only got passed less than 3 weeks ago, there’s no possible way this change was made in reaction to that.  

Basically, /r/QuitYourBullshit


what? that makes no sense. they’ve been moving macbook and ipad to usb c willingly even before the law, which takes effect in over 2 years! 

this is not a problem, they give you an adapter. i’m glad they’re switching to usb c.


Pretty sure they were required to switch the iPads to usbC


What a childish comment


The actual complaint is they can't use Apple Pencil 2 (which you can't actually charge, as it doesn't have a lightning adapter).


Before trying to be ironic, you should read my original comment once again, I didn't write all Apple dongles **made for iPhone** costed more than $1000 combined. Apples were and are selling dongles not only for iPhone but also their devices like laptops and tablets. Just go to Apple website, calculate how much that will be if you buy all dongles for all Apple devices. Go to Apple website and calculate how much that will cost if you buy all 20ish dongles, that is more than $1000.


Apple's entire product lineup is structured very specifically to make you upgrade. It's the same thing with MacBooks and iPhones. 

You start at the base model because you want the product but not the ridiculous max spec one. But there's some annoyance or multiple annoyances that would make the base model really frustrating to use in certain aspects. No big deal, just spend a couple hundred dollars to upgrade it. Oh but now you're spending as much as the base model for the next product so it would be dumb to stick with an upspecced low end model instead of the mid tier.  
This continues until next thing you know you're considering the $1500 iPad pro with hundreds for accessories all because you initially just wanted more storage and to use the not garbage apple pencil.


Give me half a genuine reason why there needs to be just 2 USB-C Thunderbolt ports on the base iMac versions but 4 on the high-end one? It has the SAME GODDAMN SOC WITH SAME BANDWIDTH.


Yeah the entire iPad lineup is like it’s designed to make you buy something you don’t need or want to get one feature


And the price went up significantly over the last generation iPad. $339 to $449 on the 64gb and $479 to $599 on the 256gb.


yeah but then the 128gb ipad pro is just $50 more so why not… but i might need the 256gb anyways so ill go up a little more?


Honestly i don’t think it has been done on purpose, lately more and more Apple stuff just doesn’t get enough thought during design phase. Best example? You can’t steam lossless music wirelessly from Apple Music, despite it having hifi mode. It works with Deezer and Tidal, but not with Apple Music, you have to connect it through the cable. I can not believe it has been done on purpose, it makes no sense what so ever, it doesn’t sell any Apple products, it doesn’t give any revenue, someone just did not think that through.


Didn't they release a phone a few years ago that effectively got bricked after a couple of updates due to insufficient memory capacity?


Because people still buy their products, no matter how much they’re getting screwed over. It ‘s like the world is full of masochists.


[ (Dongle)^2 ] ^2


I do enjoy saying dongle.


You can't go wrong with risitas


I know they did that “to reduce waste” since so many USB wall adapters had already shipped out for all the previous iPhones, but those were all USB A adapters. 
Now you have ti buy a USB C wall adapter in a separate box with more waste. 

I think it should be against the law to sell a phone without the wall charger. My dad just switched from android to iPhone and we had to run and try to find a wall plug for it at 9pm on a Sunday. I ended up just giving him mine and buying a new one the next day. But it’s still such BS


> When I got my new iPhone

See, there's your problem right there.


If you don’t have a USB-C charger in 2022 that’s kinda your own fault, USB-C has been standard in most devices for the last 6 years now


Can you use a USB spliter


When I bought my HTC U11 it had no headphone jack anymore either. But:

HTC included pretty decent USB-C-headphones (they were supposed to measure your inner ears to improve the sound, idk)

And still they included an adapter cable for your personal headphones.

I switched to Bluetooth anyway, but I *had* all the options.


It’s a usb c cable to support fast charging which lien a can’t support.


I use both Apple and Android devices for personal and work purposes, and I really can't relate. I use cross-platform solutions even on my Apple devices.

All the "syncing" features are readily available for all other platforms. Notes? Many apps like Evernote work across platforms and have way better functionality. Cloud storage? Literally dozens of choices, including Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. Again, totally cross-platform. Messages? Most people in my circles use Telegram. Again, cross-platform. 

It's almost like people deliberately lock themselves into Apple's "ecosystem" by ignoring all the alternatives and then make themselves believe that having these features work only on apple devices somehow makes it good and convenient...

As someone with both a Tab S7+ and iPad Air, the Galaxy Tab is way worse than the iPad in terms of ecosystem. Cases and pen support are terrible.


Eh, that's not a bad sell price for old electronics. Surprised you managed to sell it. Beware the cult of apple in your future endeavours though. Apparently it's like crack or something


I've bought a 250€ Galaxy Tab in 2016 and Samsung only supported it for a few months. They promised a couple of big updates but they never came - a bunch of bugs and the hellish touchwiz killed the experience.

I love android but Samsung is dead to me. There's no support whatsoever.


I'm talking about the iPad and pencil, not the cable and adapter.


Could be for an Amazon or eBay product listing. They often do really bad photoshop.


I used Qlab in HS tech as the sound engineer. I hated using the Mac (lifetime Windows user) but Qlab is such a great sound effect playback software that I would definitely buy a Mac if I continued sound tech as a career. It’s the standard for a reason but omg I wish it was on Windows.


MacOS handles audio and video way better than Windows because of its limited hardware. Qlab and Mitti (the two most common playback tools I see) both use Apple’s CoreAudio and CoreVideo APIs. Windows audio drivers are terrible for things like interfaces and virtual soundcards. I’ve had clock issues, level problems, and devices that disconnect themselves. I trust a MacBook Pro to work reliably and work well for show-critical things.


All of the large productions I've been on use GrandMA.


Fortunately the Brussels effect may just make sure that every iphone in the world gets usb-c and not only those in the EU.


The US? Meaningfully inconvenience a large corporation? Not a chance.


Their...motto?


Phone repair tech here: Yes it is. Especially in terms or repairability.


Is metal used on all their devices or just osx?


Because the mini has the wireless pad on it. The regular one does not.


Im looking at it on the website right now. Ipad 9th gen starts at $329


They still sell the old one on their website, they probably already knew the new iPad was a dumb product anyway.


The airpods pro are good but in no way the best on the market... not for value(well its apple) , sound,noise canceling or anything else...


I believe the first one was over-engineered and lived longer than their plan for integrated obsolescence.


I've had pixel 1, 3 and now 6 and they are still good. How did they go to shit after?

It went downhill when Steve Jobs passed away. When he was still there, there was a reason for Features coming later than on android, they wanted to do it the best way possible and don’t rush anything out. And now? Battery indicator with percentage that always shows full until it gets down to 20%


A lot of times they implement those features better


Live wallpaper and kinda widgets I guess I could give to you but saying they copied biometrics bc they didn’t do it first is kinda dumb


Agreed. Apple has led the trend in phone hardware design, but they've just copied Android in terms of software features


I don’t see them as copied, especially for things like widgets and customization. That’s just simple ass stuff. They just added it in way later than the rest of the market.


Honestly, I would never be able to justify buying a iPad purely for media consumption. It is too expensive when there are so many cheaper options. Even if it is better, I could never justify that price tag.


For a moment I thought Samsung was going to bring back the Android tablet appeal with Linux on Dex. You could run a full Linux distro on the tablet and that was the greatest thing to ever happen in the Android tablet sector. But alas they killed the project.


iPad with pencil before this version was the best bang for the buck tablet and performance for media consumption , notes , art, hand editing pdf / documents, signing forms … 


I wanted a remarkable 2 but an iPad that has 1000x more feature wasn’t significantly more.

The new design and price increase is a joke- last three years of iPads still perform exceptionally well and can natively charge the pencil AND now be significantly cheaper.


My opinion is it was One of the top worst design decision in a long time.  This is to get people to buy a 1k iPad Pro that is a great tablet and shit laptop at the price of a good laptop.

I'll sound like a shill but fuck it. I was/still basically am a dyed-in-the-wool Windows user but I risked it on an M1 air when they dropped, mostly to feel it out as I hadn't used a mac OS in 20 years or so, and I have to say for my use case it really was the best bang for my buck. All of my main computing is still done on my desktop pc but the macbook's been surprisingly great. I use it while running a D&D game every week and it's been way better than expected outside of some frustrations in learning the OS. I probably wouldn't have gotten it if it hadn't have been for the back to school deal that I took advantage of despite not being a student and selling the shitty airpods, but it's worked out so far.


 2015-2019 model? I just upgraded to a 2021 model and the keyboard is finally perfect


They are good, but I would just put them on par with Android phones of similar price. Nothing Apple makes is actually bad, it is just that for the price, there are very often better or similar options.


A MacBook Air is substantially more powerful, has better build quality, and will last much longer than any Chromebook. Not to mention how regularly google cancels products abruptly and without warning.


A $200 Chromebook is nowhere near as reliable as the MacBook Air. It is also comparing Apples to Oranges. A $200 computer is nowhere near as powerful.


Let me know how well developing on a chromebook goes.


Yeah I’ve had my iPhone for a couple years and it still performs great compared to past Samsung phones I had. The latter just stuffs your device with all this dodgy looking bloatware that you never use and it screws up the available storage space in the phone. That was a really fun problem to deal with on my sgs7. At least the built in apps on Mac look less sketchy and they’re usable 

Also my iPad Pro has worked flawlessly for years now. I’ve broken two cases before the device has a scratch. I bought it for the Apple Pencil usage and that’s better than any digital tablet I’ve ever used. I’m not a full time digital artist, so maybe they would have a different opinion, but I’m pretty happy with it


Seriously. I bought an old iPad on sale and it’s been great for what I use it for and still works perfectly after several years.


As someone who develops iOS programs in their free time and mostly just for fun, yeah it sucks that I have to pay so much to do iOS development. But since I’m making money off of development, it costs more to boycott apple products than it does for me to just pay apple whatever their high prices are


>Apple deliberately not providing iOS development tools for windows is not really an argument in their favour.

At the end of the day it doesn't really matter whether the limitation is real or artificial. We're arguing about the viability of a product, not Apple's ethics.

The fact is only one type of device has the tools necessary to do that job, especially now that the future of Hackintosh is unclear due to the adoption of ARM.


That’s because, at its least cynical, marketing is about getting the right customers for your product.

At its worst, it’s about getting the most profit for your product.


They didn’t at all say that. They just said apple products work.


I just walked past my laptop, which is shut, and it sounds like a fucking leaf blower. I know it’s a low bar, but when I shut my laptop lid, I expect the computer to go to sleep. Somehow windows products can’t even meet that standard.


The newer pen tech probably more expensive, but a lot more? I doubt it makes a big difference in the total material cost. It does however cause a huge usability problem for the user (I thought apple stuff just worked and was well thought out?). Apple is clearly just doing some forced product segmentation with this. Just look how close the pricing and feature set is compared to the air.

The iPad used to be apple's best value product, and this new one is still decent. But nothing with this new iPad justifies the price increase. Apple has recycled the old iPad body for generation upon generation, and a new body that brings it up to 2020 standards and inflation somehow justifies the 25% price increase? 

Apple is trying to normalize the fact that year over year upgrades now come with higher prices, we've seen this with the macbook and iPhone lineup aswell. Apple is even retaining it's old devices at the same price they launched at. Apple is clearly milking it's customers to increase their margins even more.


And yet, Apple is the company that placed the cost/design constraints of the Pen 2 technology on themselves...

To defend this ridiculous ecosystem by pointing out design constraints that Apple themselves created is not the defense you think it is.

The point being, Apple has created a scenario in which the latest version of their tablet is not compatible with the (4-year-old) latest version of their accessory, and furthermore if you *do* want to use a compatible accessory you have to jump through hoops. This is about as anti-consumer as it gets.

It's shills (and I typically hate using this word) like you who defend utterly and objectively bizarre anti-consumer practices that enable them to keep up this emperor-has-no-clothes act and pretend like they are a company that cares about design and UX. It has become a cynical, deceptive, strategic choice for Apple at this point, as they clearly don't care about actual design. It's ridiculous that they didn't move over to USB C years ago, and pretending anything else is true is just you pulling the wool over your own eyes for Apple's sake.

Argue all you want about whether or not Apple is malicious or benevolent but the fact of the matter is it doesn't matter and anything other than outright criticism enables them to keep pulling off this shit.


I guess


Dude how much does your throat hurt?


Just support the gen2 

Nobody complains their top of the line pro lacks gen1 support.


It's convoluted compared to my samsung tablet which i can just stick my stylus on the back, and it wirelessly charges it.


It's in their nature


You use it with a cord to plug in the pencil to charge, or the ipad to pair. Charging from the ipad directly was never how it was meant to be charged.


Shhhh you’re ruining the circlejerk


Ikr. Most people I know who bought the iPad mini bought it to play movies for their kids or something. Spend an extra $200 and get a real tablet because Samsung certainly isn’t making them lol

The idea that there’s some equivalent in the market to the iPad is pure cope. Every other tablet I’ve tried from other brands is dogshit compared to my iPad Pro. Apple made a solid product here and everyone else needs to catch up


Not yet, they could have waited another year before the new EU law came in otherwise this years iPhones would have been usb-c


Or a joke. Sheesh


So they made a new tablet but you have to use an old peripheric? I will never understand just how annoying apple's market practices can be.


Challenge accepted.  I just went to their website and searched for dongles.  I found 17 different devices that could be classified as a dongle, and the total cost of them all is $544.  

So besides the fact that you’re just pulling numbers out of your ass that aren’t even close to being correct, I still don’t understand what point your feeble brain is trying to make.  Apple makes dozens of products and there’s even if you wanted to add every single relevant dongle to whatever device you had, there’s going to be, at most 2 or 3 that will be useful for any one device.  Your point is almost as valid as saying you would never buy a BMW vehicle because they sell over 1000 different lug nuts for every version of car they’ve ever made in the past.  Why would anyone who bought an iPhone X 5 years ago also need to buy a dongle that allowed their MacBook to use a display port output?  And what point are you trying to make by pointing out that this option exists for a completely separate use case on a completely different product?

I’ve used Apple products for over a decade now and I think the only time I’ve ever used a dongle was when I bought a $10 third party device that allowed me to view photos from an SD card on my iPad.  You’re somehow making it out like Apple allowing you to add functionality to your devices is a bad thing.  

Also, before trying to use the word ironic, you might want to look up what that word means.  Because, trust me, it doesn’t mean anything close to what you seem to think it does.


Perfect example of asshole design! I hate it


And this is what made me buy some random samsung tablet used, cuz that has a battery free pen, expandable storage, works with my type-c stuff and I don't even need to pay apple tax.

Is it as nice as an ipad? Dunno, probably not. But it was $200 and its definitely good enough.


Reminds me of movie theatre drink prices here in India. Regular - 250, Medium - 260, large - 270 (something like that)

When you look at it you feel like a fool going for regular, when you can pay like 20-30Rs more and get double the quantity.

Truly infuriating, but I end up getting large and hating myself.


Literally all businesses operate this way. It’s business 101. Each pricing tier has to have something missing to make the next tier worth buying. Otherwise literally no one would buy the more expensive tier.


Yup. I got a 256gb iPhone 14, which is only $100 less than the pro, which is also only $100 less than the pro with 256gb… price ladders are effective. 

I would like to get a new iPad (I have a 5 year old ipad 5th gen I got refurbished), at this point I’ll either get an iPad Air 4th gen refurbished or wait until the iPad Pro 11 with the m1 hits the refurbished store.


And the best part? They do this all while raising the price of the low end models. You’re still looking at a grand for a new firsthand iPhone now.


My 2015 Macbook Air has about 13GB of free storage. Every week I get a new warning that I've run out of SSD space because it keeps re-downloading the Monterrey OS upgrade app, which is over 12GB, without my consent. I'm trying something to solve this with my fingers crossed, but with expectations that Apple will "patch" this workaround to ensure that my customer experience continues to be miserable.

Isn't it against the law in the EU? ::dreamily sighs in American::


Yeah it was so upfront not the case of environment. Also indicative of the new Apple TV remotes they're about to switch the iPhones to USB C and not even include the cable, and claim it saves even more waste.


No - what I’m saying is is it goes usb c to lightning. Usb c is normally the end you plug into your device. The ‘output’ end


>USB-C has been standard in most devices for the last 6 years now

Man, I wish I was this blind to the rest of the world. Wanna guess how many USB-C chargers I had on my home until I got my Pixel?


Evernote costs money if you want more than one device. Messaging works if you use something like telegram, but if you text then you can't get messages on apple devices if you have an android without a janky solution.

To each his own, but in my experience apple devices work better together than alternatives ie pc and android. I have an android and a pc and the messaging syncing is terrible. Never had issues when I had a mac and an iphone.

Can't say I would go that far. The ecosystem is definitely worse, but not bad enough to make it an unenjoyable experience. I use my S7+ for art and note taking all the time with no issues.

My main issue with the tablet is the display has a green tint when 120 Hz is enabled. That is a pretty big fuck up on Samsung's part.


I’ve got a Tab S6 and an iPad Pro (2021, pre M1). The iPad is way better in every way. I just keep the android around to read manga on and as a developer to create and test android builds.

Edit; that’s not to say that this isn’t asshole design. It definitely is.


Your information is very outdated. Samsung now offers 5 years of security updates and 4 OS upgrades.

Microsoft for a time shat on sound processing. It's good again nowadays because we have a proper low latency audio engine again but daaamn there was a good hole for a time (around Vista, 7, then 8)


After trying and failing for years to deal with a cheaper USB-C interface while recording, I ended up getting the studio I help at to buy a macbook pro. It literally solved all our problems with our interface overnight. It's the ASIO windows drivers that are the fucking issue. Jesus christ fuck you windows.

Because god is this annoying. Some stupid electronics tax making graphics cards more expensive in the USA? They better get more expensive in EU too, or all the USA drone people will import and dodge import taxes to get it cheaper!

Oh c'mon. Everyone knows that the Apple Pencil charges with magic.


And this whole thread is about the ipad 10 so...?


My thoughts exactly


I mean all of mine have died to my hands. Got the Pixel one when the 3 came out and it was the one that lasted the least amount of time. Destroyed it in my pocket at work and upgraded to the two XL after that. Got a crack in the screen by dropping it around when the 5 came out and bought a 3 XL, which never truly died on me but I dropped and broke the camera lens and upgraded to the 5 last summer and have been running it since. Might upgrade to a 6 pro in another year or two depending on if I drop this one. 

Honestly if I went back to using a case I probably wouldn't break them anymore.


No headphone jack, screen issues, and the overall feeling of cheapness.


Is everything Apple does better?  Absolutely not, they make tons of bad decisions. But for you to say their products are objectively worse today than they were 20 years ago is beyond ridiculous. There are tons of reasons to ding Apple for this or that, but there’s no need to just outright lie.


I don’t personally care if you hate Apple or not, that’s your opinion but you can’t just straight up lie lol 

2020 onward is some of, if not the best years for Apple products at the moment

Macs moved to ARM, no more thin and light furnaces of intel MacBooks and they created the best value laptop on the market and it’s not even close (M1 Air)

iPhones are iPhones, except the camera got even better and most importantly, battery life is the best on the market and it’s not close

I can go on, Apple really hasn’t dropped any duds in this timeframe except for this iPad.

I would be inclined to agree with you a couple years ago, but this “Apple products bad” rhetoric is just absolutely terrible timing


If you’re going to complain at least complain correctly.

iOS wasn't *drastically* different to Symbian (and spent years catching up to simple functionality like app switching.) Apple just made smartphones sexy.


What would you get instead if only streaming and browsing are needed?

My old laptop died, and I was going to get something new but its far more than an ipad for a decent  laptop.  These days I just use it as a browsing/streaming machine in the kitchen/living room, or while traveling.  An ipad 9th or 10th gen sounds decent with a keyboard, but I have never bought a apple item.


$329 is too much?


I agree with the native audio thing, macs handle audio and midi seamlessly, but all the major audio daws except logic work perfectly on windows, and more importantly for plugins and processing you can get a high spec windows machine for a tiny fraction of the price of a high spec Mac.


most people that hate on macbooks haven’t ever actually used one and they’re just following the reddit hive mind of hating on macbooks


Yup. 2017. It's flawless otherwise. I'll check out the 2021!


Lasting longer isn't really an argument when you can buy 6 Chromebooks for the price of 1 MacBook air


I don’t.


Then buy the more expensive tablet. Not everyone needs a pencil.


Okay lol, do you know what convoluted means?

Adding a single adapter isn’t “convoluted”. Again, you can also just charge it in a lightning power block and have it charged for a month in 30 mins lmao.

Also don’t worry, other iPads can do that with the 2nd gen pencil.


I'm not surprised, Apple is trying to upsell people to an iPad Air. This new tablet is their "budget" release.


Anything to nickel and dime their customers while dressing it up as courage.


>Challenge accepted. I just went to their website and searched for dongles. I found 17 different devices that could be classified as a dongle, and the total cost of them all is $544. 

You're shamefully removing some dongles for your convenience. I calculated how much that will be and that was more than $1,000. You probably can't calculate at all. Even before iPhone X, that costed more than $800, [the proof](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-dongles-2017-8#:~:text=Apple%20Makes%2023%20Different%20Dongles,%24857%20to%20Buy%20Them%20All)

>I’ve used Apple products for over a decade now and I think the only time I’ve ever used a dongle was when I bought a $10 third party device that allowed me to view photos from an SD card on my iPad

You're trying to argue that, realistically how much you're likely to spend on dongles but that's not my point either. Those who buy Apple devices buy Apple devices because they work seamlessly but the fact, Apple sells so many dongles tells they don't. If you want them to work with other devices seamlessly, you must spend on dongles as much as the most expensive iPhone at the time. 

BTW do you admit you misread my original comment? I didn't write the dongles made for iPhone costs more than $1,000. It's ridiculous that you argue that one word means when you can't even read a comment.


This is why I stopped using Apple products.

Apple Design.


Thing is they are as nice as an ipad. The regular ipad was ass and was already way overpriced before. Now it looks less bad but costs almost as much as samsungs flagship entry which has 128gb,expandable storage,a way better display and includes a pen.

Apple abandoned all pretense this year. Absolutely boring mediocre products while vastly increasing the price and fucking the consumer over wherever they can.


That's how it is in the USA too. Popcorn is even worse.


Features missing vs actively making parts of a product shit are 2 different things.


Not like this though. Anything that doesn't use such a closed ecosystem like say an android phone can't just not offer a mid range 128gb option to force you into the 256gb one because the customer will just go to a competitor that does offer 128gb.


Sounds more like the reason for the rainbow logo.


I'm convinced that the reason the maker of it changed Mr. and Mrs. Potatohead to just Potatohead and included both gender parts in the package wasn't some "woke" action but because it halved their packaging and factory line costs.


Reducing the "waste" in your wallet.


The Mexican Pizza is a great example


I only had USBC because of the switch, if it wasnt for that i wouldn't  have had any.


New European law says ALL new mobile devices (phones, tablets, cameras) sold in the EU must have usb c charging by the end of 2024. Laptops will follow in 2026.


https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024


I’m Australian and most of my devices have been USB-C for 6 years


Yeah, I pay yearly for Evernote for how convenient and powerful it is. Plenty of free solutions though, even as simple and powerful as Google Docs, if you don't want to pay. That's the beauty of actually having a choice.

As for messaging, the only reason "janky solutions" are required for Apple devices is because they refuse to support RCS, which has been adopted by everyone else. Precisely for the reason of having their own locked and proprietary standard no one else can use. 

Even if we take other proprietary solutions, like Samsung's PC Link - they are simply better and they work with any Windows PC. And they are actually seemless, like allowing to access not only messages or calls, but any app on the phone from the computer without even touching the phone itself. It's huge, and yet no one hypes it up like any minor thing that apple does.

Otherwise, I don't disagree with "to each their own", but it irks me when I hear about how great Apple ecosystem is, when in reality it's just a mediocre functionality locked behind proprietary standards and the need to own only their devices. And apparently that's what people want, considering the sales figures, so I am in a minority here.


It may be outdated but the brand damage has been done. 250€ was a lot of money for a tablet that I personally had to jailbreak to make it usable. Even the hardware failed on me. Fuck Samsung


Yeah, entirely depends on if you're the house/venue or the touring production. The tours I've seen/been with will either use a little ETC Ion or one of the GrandMA consoles. Houses vary all over the place as far as price/quality/fixtures goes - I've seen a lot using AVP or SCS (if they're not using qlab) for projection mapping/video control.

GrandMA has a full projection mapping bit, but the one on ETC consoles is generally poor and supplemented by Qlab/other software.


I don't know but in this case the value of the euro vs dollar may play a big part in the price increases.


This is from my own experience: Motorolas always come in for the most ridiculous problems + the screen repairs usually end up costing as much as the phone due to the increased labor and more annoying parts to get. 

If you have an iPhone 11 currently (which tbh you can be 3 years behind for an iPhone I see people run 7's still and be just fine) you are looking at a decent phone with a cheap repair.

Now! I'd you are going for a current model phone? Fuck Apple go for even Samsung. That is where it is overpriced.


How many other graphic api's can say that?


Okay cool, but I'm a 250lb gorilla.

My phones DO NOT exist outside a combat or impact rated Otterbox.

You went from the Google Pixel 1 to a new generation. 

I had a Pixel XL, in an Otterbox or two for over 6 years.

You went from a Pixel to a Pixel 2 and never had the flagship release of the Pixel XL.

My point is simply that the Pixel XL was way over designed and I won the lottery by actually keeping the phone safe.

Samsung and Apple phones forced on me by my employer die YEARLY, with the same, or objectively BETTER cases and peripherals.


Seems more like personal anecdotes because none of that bothers me. I got usb headphone with the pixel 3 and they are still good and 99 percent I use Bluetooth. Also doesn't feel cheap at all


I heard of that, but that was likely because of the shitstorm they got. Or they rushed it out and forgot to implement that feature completely


I mean would you say every computing company that sells computers copied Apple for releasing a computer with a mouse? Or every smartphone company copied Nokia for using an oled screen? Features like that are just qol improvements and the next logical step forward


Yes and no...I agree that Android OEMs have always been more innovative, but that Apple has led things in terms of mainstream adoption. As said above, removable batteries went extinct after the iPhone, as did headphone jacks and memory cards - both of which are demonstrably useful - but those absences are more widespread than the adoption of foldable screens, for example. 

Speaking of foldable screens - my prediction is that no matter what Samsung or anyone else does they won't see wide adoption until Apple "innovates" it


You could say the same for Google using a DOT sensor for face unlock after Apple introduced FaceID, or Android and Windows manufacturers using glass capacitive touchscreens instead of plastic resistive (LG technically did it a month earlier first, but the iPhone triggered the trend), fast pairing Bluetooth devices, gesture navigation on the iPhone X implemented in Android 9, notification badges in Android 8 (although manufacturers added it to their skins earlier), security granularity added in Android 10.

It’s an industry that requires and encourages copying, borrowing, improving, etc. It happens on both sides and shouldn’t be shit on, but encouraged. At the end of the day, iOS users now have widgets and Android users now have improved privacy settings. We should all be happy.


Samsung tabs are good enough if you find a deal

Tab S7 was on sale a while ago for around £300 ish. You get VLC player and full file browser so download and play whatever


Literally any android tablet at half the price and the same screen.

If you only want it for media consumption the iPad loses value. If you are deep in the apple ecosystem or use the iPad for productivity, then the line blurs.


Chrome book for $250


Bought an Xiaomi Pad 5 last year for 299 Euros and couldn't be happier! Great screen, twitch, YouTube vanced, Firefox and Reddit work great, the 16:9 ratio is much better for media than iPad 4:3 and price is definitely much better. 
There are 90/120Hz tablets out there for around 300 Euro/Dollars and for just media consumption they are more than enough


At this point I agree. They're obviously not the choice for gaming or if you're insanely against learning more than one OS for some reason, and I'd never choose one as my only computer, but for general use mine's been fine. A lot of the MacOS desktop management features/trackpad gestures really help a lot with managing an extra screen and several windows/apps when I'm running games.


Right, which leads to the question. Do I want a single computer for 6 years, that has a nice screen, long battery life, and a variety of other premium features; or would I like a new computer every year, that ends up breaking or wearing out?

This ignores the fact that having 6 computers is naturally 6 times worse for the environment than one computer.


Yes. Having to use a separate adapter or dongle is convoluted in comparison to Samsung's solution.  
You'd have to be an absolute apple fanboy to not see that.


I just did what you told me to do, and now you’re backtracking, quoting 5 year old articles as “proof” and you’re STILL not able to show me a total that adds up to over $1000.  At this point, you’re the one that’s not reading your own comments, because you said if I go to Apples website and add up all the dongles it adds up to over $1000.  I did that, and guess what?  You’re wrong.

As far as me being “wrong” about what you said, I will admit, I was trying to make sense of the idiocy contained in your first comment, so I did assume that you were trying to make a relevant point and were talking about the dongles for the iPhone, and not, for some unknown reason, talking about all of the dongles for all of the devices that Apple currently makes or has made in the past 10 years.  When you clarified your poorly worded and pointless statement, I then asked to clarify what point you were trying to make by adding up the cost of dongles that were unrelated to the iphone while talking about that phone.  Again, I ask you, why Apple selling a dongle that allows you to connect your laptop to a display port is even remotely relevant to the cost of ownership or operation of an iPhone, and you’ve yet to address that, most likely because there’s no intelligent way to address it without admitting that you didn’t have a valid point to begin with, you just wanted to jump on the mindless bandwagon hate of something because you read a hatchet piece article about them 5 years ago that’s been living rent free in your head ever since even though it wasn’t relevant then, and it’s even less relevant now.  

You say that people that buy Apple devices need to buy dongles, but I’ve already told you that that hasn’t been my experience.  I’ve owned half a dozen iPhones, 3-4 iPads, and 3 MacBooks, and aside from the one previously mentioned $10 adapter, and maybe a USB C hub that I actually bought for a non-Apple device, I haven’t had the need to use a dongle in over 15 years.  Yet somehow you want to throw out mindless shade because there are options for adding functionality that most people don’t need, but in the rare use case they do, they can drop $49, and add that feature?  What dongle specifically do you think that all iPhone X owners needed to buy that would have added extra cost?  How many dongles do you think the average Apple user actually needs or buys?  Do you even think about the things you’re spewing, or are you just regurgitating poor clickbait headlines from 5 years ago as proof that all Apple users are just dongle buying sheep who have nothing better to do than collect thousands of dollars of useless accessories?  

Grow up, try and think for yourself, try and make a valid point that doesn’t use hyperbolic made up “data” from 5 years ago, or at the very least just keep your mouth shut about things that you clearly have little to no knowledge about.  I have a feeling there’s a lot that fits under that umbrella.


Stick your index and middle finger down to second knuckle and try to say "Apple".


I mean that's Apple and has been Apple for years. Proprietary adapters, insanely pricey repairs and other generally the inability of their devices to be repaired. I don't get why people still buy anything from them.


I don't even have a proper charger for my switch so charging it takes days just to use it for an hour.


Let me swap America for very high income countries, then.

Very cool. I’ve never gotten a chance to play with a GrandMA, so I learned something today. Thanks!


Any possible response would be a personal anecdote.


>would you say every computing company that sells computers copied Apple for releasing a computer with a mouse?

Yes. The mouse, as a HID system, is an Apple idea that was copied by the rest of the industry.

>every smartphone company copied Nokia for using an oled screen

Yes, but to a lesser degree. To my knowledge, Nokia did not invent OLED, they were simply the first to realize it's benefit for mobile phones. Other manufacturers did too, but only after Nokia took the risk first. So they were "copied" in that sense.

"The next logical step forward" isn't really a thing. Logically, Betamax was better than VHS but it failed. Logic has little to do with market trends.


It's not that Apple led things in terms of adoption, but rather customers accepting whatever Apple does. If other companies come out with a phone without headphone jack they will be deemed stupid and their products wouldn't sell. If Apple does the same, iPhone users will still buy iPhones and now you have customers who are accepting this change so finally other companies can do the same since customers will not complain. 

In short, it's the loyal Apple fanbase that is leading adoption of new technologies and stupid decisions.


Can I not play movies downloaded from torrents on an ipad?  I would often grab a few before a flight and put them on my phone/laptop.

I thought I read that android OS development on tablets was pretty much dead.


I would love one, I'm not an Apple fan by any means. But I'm a huge fan of the m1 chip. I will probably pick one up when Linux support for arm processors improves. But even running OS X it would be a pretty good laptop. I don't use any Apple products other than my laptop for work and it's pretty solid. But I have to remind myself not to expect the same performance.

Requiring ONE extra step isn’t convoluted if you can blink. I hope that isn’t extremely complicated for you.

Nah, you’re just a crybaby who wants to hypebolize situations when apples newest pencil does the same thing as Samsungs.

Also lmao the reviews for Samsung pens are also awful


Wow this Apple jihadist write so long. That could be the longest statement that I'm I don't need to read. 

>I just did what you told me to do, and now you’re backtracking

No, I didn't say, you can exclude dongles because you find tHAt'S NoT a dOnGle. Go to [this link](https://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all/power-cables?fh=459d%2B45b0) and exclude chargers and some stuff, add up the prices of all dongles, that will be more than $1,000. I'm sure you will say some of them aren't Apple's but if unnecessary, why do Apple need to sell third party dongles on their website? I think they must be included as long as they're on Apple website. 

>When you clarified your poorly worded and pointless statement, I then asked to clarify what point you were trying to make by adding up the cost of dongles that were unrelated to the iphone while talking about that phone

Your poor assumptions aren't my responsibility. when you assume something because you didn't read a comment carefully, that's your responsibility, kid. 

>You say that people that buy Apple devices need to buy dongles, but I’ve already told you that that hasn’t been my experience. I’ve owned half a dozen iPhones, 3-4 iPads, and 3 MacBooks, and aside from the one previously mentioned $10 adapter, and maybe a USB C hub that I actually bought for a non-Apple device

You seem to believe your case works for everyone. I don't care if you've not bought a dongle from your goddamn Apple or not. I'm arguing that Apple is selling the amount of dongles and the total amount, which you can't deny. That's less than $1000 according to your definition? So what? Even  $500 is a lot of money. Why do Apple need to sell the dongles? 

If you says the article can't be a proof because that's too old, then you're supposed to be able to find dongles not being sold on Apple website right? Otherwise, the article can be the proof even that's 5 years old. When I calculated all Apple dongles including, Apple certified dongles on Apple website, that was more than $1126. Grow up? I happened to find your comments in the post, you reply to comments critical to Apple and defend Apple from any angles. Is that mature. I really don't get what you write aggressively to describe you better.


Simply because apple is as much a fashion icon as nike. Your paying for the apple logo. It is funny because if Microsoft did the same, they would get slapped with an anti trust so fast...


Don’t break your expensive electronics and the lightning cable has seen a longer shelf life than the multiple usb variants.


Yeah but there was a time when apple was ahead. They made the best and most consistent tablets/phones. Now with years long updates from samsung and even mid tier devices beeing way overpowered for the average user its basicly just draining money from people for the logo.


The mouse as an HID system was actually invented and developed by Xerox and Apple copied it and made it more efficient


To consumers though betamax and vhs were functionally the same, and also dvds came out shortly before betamax officially died. I guess you could make the same argument with blu rays, but then streaming came and kinda ducked both of them too


I used to have both an ipad pro and a samsung galaxy tab s7. The number of steps I had to go through to load movies and tv shows onto the ipad was just a pain in the ass, but that might be due to me only have a windows computer. Loading media files onto the samsung tablet was super easy, literally an app that connects my PC to the tablet via bluetooth (or wifi) and transfers the files without any cables or dongles involved. Additionally, because android has an actual file system, finding and playing the media files is super easy. 

In terms of app development, yeah, the app store on iOS would probably be way more developed than for android. But they (Google and Samsung) are making a bigger push to get devs to make their apps more compatible with tablets because they're classifying folding devices as tablets. Android 12L is specifically for better tablet use.

If you're just using the tablet as a media consumption device, the galaxy tabs are a pretty good deal. They have 120 hz, OLED screens, microSD slots to expand memory capacity for a much cheaper price than an ipad, very similar battery life as an ipad, and samsung dex allows you to use them sorta like a chromebook/laptop if you get a keyboard case.


Android itself is pretty solid on tablets. And has been improved a lot lately. Probably because Google is releasing their own tablet soon.

There is however a lot fewer tablet apps than for iPads. Most media consumption apps are there, but a lot of social media apps just use the phone version, and there's a lot fewer tablet specific apps like image editing and drawing apps.

But if media consumption is what you need, Samsungs main line tablets are great! Some of the best amoled screens, and very acceptable speakers


The cheapest android tablet will let you install a torrent client on it saving you from having to transfer.


It is partly. Samsung especially males great Tablets but they are also overpriced for their system. Too much bloatware. Und the second store for Samsung stuff sucks. I recently switched from tab s7 to the new one. But I regret it and will be switching to an iPad this winter season. I’m mainly are in the apple ecosystem with my phone and my laptop, so it makes sense to stay in there. And the safety features on my iPhone (and some of them aren’t cloudbased) aren’t that bad. And for tablets, iPad os is a lot bigger and more apps to choose from.


> I have to remind myself not to expect the same performance.

Yeah that was kinda the conclusion I came to in the end. It's nice to have access to MacOS-only apps and the relative power the m1 puts out for things like music production but for raw power and variety of use it's never gonna outdo my home rig. And in regards to Apple products as a whole I still don't buy into the ecosystem. The macbook is my only Apple thing and it requires zero dongles and ecosystem for it to work for me, so I'm happy with it.


I’m saying the article can’t be used as proof because even though it’s 5 years old, it STILL doesn’t come close to the $1000 figure you pulled out of your ass and are still quoting. 

And yeah, I’m not gonna count the price of third party adapters in a discussion of dongles made by Apple. Especially when you’re still dodging the one question that I’ve asked you 3 times now, which is why you seem to think it’s relevant in a discussion about iPhone dongles to bring up the fact that Apple sells adapters for unrelated products. Or any of my other questions about how many dongles you actually think are necessary for the average Apple user. You’re trying to spin the fact that many options exist for adding functionality for your devices including many made by companies that AREN’T Apple as a bad thing. Without offering even the first hint of reasoning behind why you seem to think that’s a bad thing. I would say it’s pathetic how low you’re slinking to win some pedantic internet argument, but hell, you’re not even winning. You’re just making yourself look more and more clueless with every single comment you make.


Not today they wouldn’t. Microsoft was slapped with an antitrust before they were bribing politicians. Now that they pay their bribes they’re virtually untouchable. Antitrust only applies to those that don’t pay the government’s protection racket.


Well, yes, but I was simplifying


This is about whether or not Apple copies others, not a discussion of outdated video media 🤦‍♂️


>I’m saying the article can’t be used as proof because even though it’s 5 years old, it STILL doesn’t come close to the $1000 figure you pulled out of your ass and are still quoting.

This is what you wrote, check this out
>>I just did what you told me to do, and now you’re backtracking, quoting 5 year old articles as “proof”

I can't read this to mean you did mean the article can be a proof because that was less than $1,000.


>And yeah, I’m not gonna count the price of third party adapters in a discussion of dongles made by Apple.

So, according to your theory, Apple can proudly announce we no longer sell dongles because they work seamlessly after asking third party companies to make all necessary dongles and sell them on their website right? Which I hope you also find ridiculous. Just put goddamn ports to their laptops which costs ridiculously expensive. Then that works for everyone, even for you but you're here to shout out that's not so bad, in my case no dongle was necessary. How stupid can you be for your motherfucker Apple?


Best euphemism for "wrong" I've heard today 😄


Oh man.  You’re so mad you even forgot to downvote me.  This is fun!

I’m sorry that I wasn’t clear on all of the reasons why your dumb article wasn’t proof of the thing you claim it was.  I said it was dumb back then, it’s even more dumb now, but I did forget to mention that $857 is less than $1000, and I guess someone as slow as you really needs someone to spell out every last intricate detail for them.  To be fair, this is a perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger effect where people who are too dumb to function are literally too stupid to understand how dumb they are.  It’s common enough for there to be an entire Wikipedia page about it, so don’t feel like you’re alone.  Help is available, but unfortunately for the rest of us, it requires you to stop telling the world how dumb you really are, so there’s little to no chance of relief anytime soon, I’d imagine.  I’ll enjoy the idiot rage in the meantime though.  

And yeah, I don’t even know how to begin to have a thought pattern that will allow you to make sense of why it is completely stupid to count third party adapters in the total cost of all of Apple’s adapters.  That’s literally as smart as saying “well Apple sells a $600 drone made by DJI on their website too, so that’s why I’ll never buy an iPhone”.  It makes less than no sense and if you had an iq higher than your shoe size, you would be able to see that.  

But unfortunately here we are.  At least we still have your rage.  :)


My wallet is ready if the screen has improved.


Love my iPad Mini 6. Gimme an OLED screen and an M1 and it'll be an instant upgrade for me.


> based on a new report by DigiTimes.

always treating reports by this publication with a pinch of salt


Really wish they’d do one with ProMotion. Just can’t get used to a device without it after all the years on the various Pros. I’d have one in a heartbeat…but also I’d keep my 12.9, MBP…so maybe it’s best they don’t.


If it gets pro-motion then I’m here for it.


All these people in the comments asking for Pro-level features are gonna be reeeeally disappointed for no reason when it’s just an internals refresh with like an A16 or something. 

It’s not getting 120hz, it’s not getting OLED, and it’s not getting an M2.

At best it’ll get a new display that works better and has MicroLED or something.


The current mini is such a weird price point in their line up. It’s priced like it’s a premium model with a smaller screen but then has almost the same specs as the 10th Gen iPad that’s $50 cheaper with a larger screen. Hopefully this update will either bring the specs up to the air or better and lower the price point a bit. (Though I doubt we get both)


Biggest upgrade it needs is software support for the screen/resolution size so everything isn’t comically tiny


I have the 6 and love it.


Everyone is talking about promotion but all I want is the screen to be brighter, it’s impossible to use outside.


Hopefully the screen is brighter. The 6 was marketed pretty heavily towards pilots and the screen is terrible in direct sunlight.


120hz or Riot


I hope they decide to concentrate on the right updates this time. It's a mini. It doesn't need power. No one buys a mini to create publications or cut movies. What it needs is a great screen with 120hz and lots of battery. It should also not cost more than a larger iPad.


Fix the screen. Make better use of it. Improve brightness. New processor. More storage. Better camera. Boom.


I just bought one after waiting a year to see if they’d update it, so you’re all welcome


Any chance of a new Pro this year?


90 or 120hz and I’m sold


I don’t care if they put M2 Max chip in it, if it’s 60Hz then it’s a big giant NO


I want a mini Pro so bad…


Everyone wants a lot of stuff in this new iPad Mini....I just want a better price. Shit, I'd take a reduction in specs in exchange for a better price. Think about it: if you have a young child/early teen, they're likely rocking an iPad that starts at a 9.7 inch screen, which is BONKERS. The minis have always been much more costly with lesser sales. I use a site called slickdeals and new minis hit about $399 at best. iPad sales can easily hit $299, if not lower. 

My kid currently has an Samsung tab as I was able to get it at about $130 from Sams one day and it's about 7 inches. Perfect size. Downfall is I then had to get the Google Play Games thing which is far outside of my ecosystem, especially as Apple Arcade is included in my sub. 

All this to type that similar to the rumors of Apple launching a chromebook competitor, I hope they one day think about the parents who just wanna give them kids a cheap ass tablet which isn't the size of a picture book after a case is put on it.


Make an iPad mini pro you cowards


I just wish they’d have larger internal storage. 256GB just isn’t enough. Give me at least 1TB.


Unless the jelly scrolling in portrait is addressed and the UI scaling is addressed, this is going to be remain disappointing.

Though, I’d be okay with Apple adding SM to the Mini.


64GB


If they ever came out with a mini that had promotion, Face ID and a better camera then I would be all over it!


Mini with a folio keyboard better screen and decent camera will be great! Also M1 at least cause everything new requires that processor.


Bring it back to a decent price tag and I’ll buy it.


Don't lie to me and get my hopes up again.

Screen upgrade and you can take my money!


JUST bought a 6 but I’m still in the return window… return and wait?


OLED + M2/A17 would make this interesting but an A16 ain’t too bad


I use the iPad mini 6 as an EFB (you know.. what they advertised so much about) but the truth of the matter is that using it in the cockpit is horrible since the screen brightness is horrendous, I just end up using my iPhone. I pray the mini 7 solves this and Apple increases the max brightness.


I want a mini AND a 15 inch version 😂


The 6th generation one is so far pretty much everything I ever wanted from it. it fits a purse perfectly, the battery life in my use is astounding and its specs are insane for a mini-tablet. nothing else in the market comes even close.


So both Air and Mini can be updated within this year. If so I'm pretty torn between them. I've been using my iPad Pro all the day, but my current workflow definitely requires another iPad to display more documents.

I'll go with Air. While Mini is very lovely, but in the end,  a small screen can sometimes hurt but a big one never.


no pro-motion, no go.


Give it an iPad Pro form factor please.


I can see it being the same screen with the same ole jelly scroll. I’ve been able to look past it all these years but that screen is just not up to apple standards. I’m sure most people here would take a $50 increase for a better screen.


i just wish they would at least have 90hz... 60hz in 2023/24 is just embarrassing


Surprised at the love for the current gen on this post. I’m a bit of a legacy home button/touch-ID fan, but  for me using the gen 6 mini is a particularly awful experience


From the article: Apple could be preparing to release a seventh-generation iPad mini before the end of the year, based on a new report by [DigiTimes](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230922VL207/digitimes-research-pc-ce-tablet.html).

In an article discussing stagnating global tablet demand in the second half of 2023, the Taiwan-based outlet forecasts an uptick in Apple's share of the market owing to orders for a "small-size" iPad in the fourth quarter. From the report:

*In the second quarter, iPad shipments had a sequential decline higher than those of non-iPad tablets, resulting in iPads' combined shipment share seeing two consecutive quarters of decline. However, the share will gradually pick up during the second half because of Apple's inventory replenishment needs in the third quarter and orders for a new small-size iPad in the fourth quarter, the figures show.*


I don't know that an update is really required.  I guess going to M1 or M2 would be good, but it honestly feels like overkill since it has the A15.  I don't see them putting a ProMotion display on it and it already comes with USB-C.


I have an iPad mini 5, bought 6 months before the iPad mini 6 came out. This iPad has the same chip as the iPhone XR. (iPad mini 6 has iPhone 13 chip.)

But I have zero performance complaints about it. I’ve done numerous music apps on it without issue either. I have this desire to want a newer version to replace this one’s flaws. But in reality it doesn’t seem to have flaws.


😂


I'm not speaking to anyone directly, but some of ya'll need to remember the Mini is not a pro, a new Mini does not automatically mean it's going to be a Pro device just because there has been discussion of a Pro Mini in the future. Not even sure a Mini Pro has been anything more than wishes from Apple fans. I'm not in anyway saying they won't make an iPad Mini Pro at all either. Could just be a new Mini, Could just be a new Mini Pro on top of keeping the same Mini base. Could be both new.  


Just thought I'd say that because I'm seeing all kinds of spec wishes across the board and some not wanting the price to go up. Lots of opinions on this, maybe more so than any other Apple product as the screen is a hot topic/very requested upgrade, and this is a cheapish and very loved device...by those who don't despise the screen lol. They aren't going to add a M2 or M3, more RAM, brighter HDR OLED/Micro LED, ProMotion 120hz, 128/256gb standard, much better camera with lidar, add FaceID while maybe keeping TouchID etc etc and keep it $499 and routinely on sale for $399.

The iPad Air is $599, doesnt even have ProMotion/OLED and also still starts at 64gb


Rumors have that itl have a screen


Anyone else kinda hoping for a rumor that isn’t “IPAD MIGHT LAUNCH YALL INDUSTRY REPORT SAYS IT MIGHT”


Promotion and M series chip would be helluva upgrade. Being able to stage manager on a such a small device would be a game changer


Why does the iPad get a mini version but not the iPhone?


Can someone explain what the appeal of the iPad mini is, and why you would choose it instead of an iPhone Max or regular iPad?


Armv9, h266, wifi7? Guess I have to wait for ipad mini 8


120hz or it’s trash.


The best e-reader /j


I just want a new, 11 inch miniLED or OLED ipad with 120hz…my 2020 ipad pro is beat up, battery is degrading…


For me a brighter screen with smaller bezels > 120hz


What?!

Are you saying that Apple, that released the current iPad mini 2 years ago, is looking to release a new model in the near future?

I mean, the knowledge and inside information it takes to create such a scoop is nothing less than mind blowing.


I believe it.


My daughter has an iPad Mini 4 as a communication device that is getting a bit long in the tooth (and now two main iPadOS versions behind). We’ll upgrade her to the Mini 7 whenever it does launch.


How about iPhone nano/micro/pico/whatever bring back the OG iPhone SE/5S/5 chassis plskthx


Shrink the bezels and it'd be perfect


If this got the M1 and could do the external screen thing it would be perfect!


ProMotion and FaceID PLEASE PLEASE I WILL PAY


Apple releasing new iPads, I think I can believe it


Why does it not have FaceID?


i just want an iPad Pro Mini 😫


Just give it a M processor and I’m all in !


I love my mini.  The one upgrade Id appreciate the most is 4 speakers.  I use it in a constantly noisy environment and would love a little more volume.


120hz, oled and M1 chip will be an instant buy from me.


I can't wait. I'm someone who always needs the newest hottest top tier stuff, and the iPad mini is my favorite mobile device, certainly my favorite iPad. It doesnt have the best specs, but man it's the perfect size. I'm sure I'm a buyer day one for this.


Am I the only one who would love a Smart Keyboard Folio for the Mini?


I’m willing to upgrade if the screen is better. My mini is awesome


Promotion iPad Mini plz


At least make the screen brighter 🙏🙏


Give me 120Hz display and at least a good USB-C for data transfer, and I’ll buy it it on the spot.


I’ve been on. 9.7” pro with the home button since it came out, and so I’m dying for an upgraded iPad. Maybe this will be the one!


As a traveler the Mini is the perfect size for use on airplanes. I can slip the device in my back pocket when I board and the battery lasts long enough for an entire flight and then some.


My iPad Mini 5 is my favorite Apple device ever. The design is literally perfect to me and I prefer it greatly over the 6.


People expecting  true HDR

Y’all really think the iPad mini is getting microled or OLED before the 11” Pro does

And an M1 is a total non starter. 

A binned a17 is plausible though.


I wish it was cheaper


Smaller bezels and I'll buy one Day 1


It really needs 120Hz display, and pure blacks (OLED or microLED) with proper HDR would be a huge asset for watching videos.


Ditto to that. I own an Ipad Pro and an Ipad Mini. Guess which one I'm keeping? It's hard to beat the versatility of the Ipad Mini, even with the upgrades of the Ipad Pro. 

The mini just needs a better screen. Brighter and 120 hz display. Then its the perfect tablet for most people.


They need to do an iPad Mini Pro already.


Mine too. I don’t usually upgrade from an n to an n+1, but I have loved the iPad mini 6 unlike any Apple device I’ve ever owned, it just lacks the better screen. That ray tracing chip would be nice as well.


Always-on display and an M SoC I’m jumping this


Mine tooo


I have a Mini 6 and I can't figure out what the issue is. Like, at all. It's my most-used iPad. I think that if no YouTubers, etc., had said anything, no one would have noticed.


If the Mini was basically a small version of the Pro that would amazinggg


It’s bonkers to think that M1 comes to this. That’s incredibly powerful chip. It runs the 24” iMac as well. Maybe all the unused M1 chips will go to support the new iPad mini.


The Mini has in the past been a smaller version of the Air, not the Pro. I highly doubt it'll happen.


M1 will consume too much power for use in the iPad mini. Besides, on such a small screen you aren't going to be running apps on it that take advantage of even the A17 Pro, let alone the (slightly more powerful) M1.


[deleted]


I mean. What can the m1 iPad even do that your current mini can’t? No reason to upgrade and sustain more ewaste. Don’t buy into the dreams of these capitalistic companies and only upgrade when your mini breaks down


As long as it has DC dimming


I love mine, too, but it’s so dark that I seriously think something’s wrong with it. Even with maxed brightness it looks very dim when compared to… well, every damned other device in my house.


I bet you get an A17, not an M1.


Apples never gonna put an M series into the iPad mini. 

Just as they’re never putting stage manager, Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro on the iPad mini

I wish it weren’t this way but I’d bet it is


clicks are down… time for another rumor article :)


I first read that as Dingus Times. lol. Had to look at it twice


I agree with you but i doubt they’ll bring pro motion to the mini


I can honestly say that I go between my 14pro/15pro and iPad mini without noticing. 

I’m happy about it. Because low resolution devices are horrible to my eyes.


what is there to notice? I honestly don‘t get it. Isn‘t it just an energy saving feature?


I’m sold if they fix the jelly scroll.


Mini usually have the same specs as the airs that are released at the time. Laminated displays, same chips, gen 2 pencil ect. It is a premium model that is very popular for people who do technical field work.


Ipad mini has a larger screen than most phones but priced lower. It needs to be priced lower than the iPad as well. 

But iPad can't be priced higher so we get this weird pricing scheme. 

I prefer it as its large enough to hold with one hand but small enough to not tire my arms out. It's great for reviewing PDFs and doing work in the field. Easier to turn on than a laptop for emails or to check a document. 

Not to mention take a quick photo. It is easily a laptop replacement for a lot of people out in the field.


I understand why Apple don’t want to make the line-up too complicated, but I’d like to see them treat the mini as a size preference rather than a single device. So, a standard iPad mini with features aligned more with the base or Air, and then an 8.3” pro with at at least some feature parity to the rest of the pro sizes.

I love my pro. It’s an incredible device, and the size is great for so many things. But I’m in probably a tiny minority who’d really appreciate some of that goodness (especially the screen) in a smaller form factor, even if the price was the same as the 11”.


It has a better screen with antireflective counting and P3 Gamut.   Its a smaller version of the air but on different release cycle.    Its going get a M1 Chip and a landscape front camera.


I bought a mini 6 refurbished and it felt like it was about the right price point for a new device. It was at least in good condition


The font must be a conspiracy from Tim Apple to force us to purchase Apple prescription lenses… I’m gonna go blind with this tiny font!


This is honestly the top issue for me. Resolution needs to change so the UI can match a pro max or 11” iPad Pro. I’ll take this over 120 hz any day.


same here.


I bought mini 6 after a month making love with my mini  i accidentally drop in hot tup :( I didn’t have apple care. I couldn’t  wait more than 3 days i went to Apple Store bought another one. 

It’s a must have device for me .


What do you use it for? I was gonna grab one for school but decided that it was too small.


Well, the nice thing is that every other display on every other device recently has gone up to 2000 nits. As long as it’s oled.


> it’s impossible to use outside.

Also impossible to use with most streaming services, even with everything cranked up, accessibility and autobrightness disabled, etc. It's incredibly dark, even in a completely black room watching videos.


Agree. As someone who uses my mini most often as my “portable tv” I want them to double nits. I’ve been thinking about jumping to Android for this reason (but I really don’t want to).


Username checks out!


yeah I wish the screen was brighter and better battery for those long CFI days


"Enjoy your riot" - Tim Apple  
 
I think ProMotion will continue to be a Pro only feature until the Pro models have a shiny new whizbang thing to sell as an exclusive, namely and probably microLED


Given that the iPhone 15 still doesn’t have it, and the iPad Mini is partially also “the budget iPad”, I’d say they either release an “iPad Mini Pro” next to the current model, with a way higher price…or just upgrade the existing screen slightly (bit brighter or something).


>It's a mini

And iPhone 15 Pro Max is just a phone - I for one, would love iPad Mini Pro. I'd love to have small device to stay organized while being on film sets, but would love to be able to lidar scan with it.


It’s going to cost more than the base iPad because it traditionally has a better SOC.


If nothing else, they need to release a model that's equally priced with the default iPad. I don't want to pay more money for a smaller device, I just want something... not laptop-sized.


[deleted]


I want 120hz as much as anybody, I just don’t think they’d do it. But what if they did 90hz for the Mini & Air, 60hz on the base models, and 120hz on the pros?


I disagree.


I would rather have Face ID and stage manager than 120 Hz ￼

3 app columns on the screen, yes please.


Thank you for your service.


Unlikely without the M3 available. Unless the iPad is the first device having it, of course..


iPad Pro is generally on an 18-month cycle, and seems to be expected to come in a spring event in 1H2024.


This. They need to split the mini line between a cheaper, base model, and a pricier Pro model with better screen & storage options.


First they need to increase iCloud storage from 5gb to 256gb


Storage is fine. Just give us pro motion


Ya I don’t care about storage. Majority want to do certain tasks on an iPhone but on a larger screen, like reading a book or the news or watching YouTube videos or the use of HomeKit devices. 

The screen is the most important upgrade this iPad mini needs.


256 gigs is fine. Look into getting a NAS (network attached storage) to offload your unnecessary files.


It has USB-C, you can buy a Samsung T7 and quintuple your storage on the cheap


[deleted]


Haven't people been using the mini as an EFB since it first came out and have specifically been buying the mini because of how it fits perfectly in the dash or whatever? I can't see how the brightness is now suddenly a problem but I guess it doesn't work out for everyone.


Other than “animations look smoother”, do you have an actual reason why 120hz is necessary? 

People aren’t gaming at 120hz on iPads, they’re not watching 120hz videos…

It’s nice to have but I’m entirely unconvinced that it’s somehow necessary or “embarrassing”


Even 90z is garbage.  There’s been 120hz in android for a decade.  There’s no excuse anymore.


Yeah performance is not an issue at all, it’s just the usability


I have the iPad mini 5 and iPhone SE 2, so all home buttons and Touch ID. I bought the mini 5 only a few months before the 6 came out. I was a little bummed because of the huge chip difference between them, but honestly I love this device. I definitely love the home button and wish all future models would have that. I wonder if future iPad minis won’t have the same magic for me. This device has the A11 chip I believe which is from the iPhone XR. So a pretty outdated chip by today’s standards. But from my experience I have zero performance complaints. Even using music creation apps and stuff.


Fuck what am I gonna do with it now ?!


That is such an incredibly niche use case that it is highly unlikely that Apple will ever introduce a “Mini Pro”.


M series chip will draw too much power, and with the smaller design of iPad mini, you can't fit the thermal mass to make the extra power useful anyways.


because the iPhone 13 mini didn't do so good... there is also the iPhone SE


The iPad mini has an 85% bigger screen than the 15 Pro Max, close to double the surface area. With the aspect ratio differences and dynamic island factored in, the iPad mini also has a dramatically larger viewable window for 16:9 media.

[iPad Mini 15 Pro Max size comparison ](https://www.displaywars.com/8,3-inch-d%7B2266x1488%7D-vs-6,7-inch-d%7B2796x1290%7D)

The regular iPad is a different size class than the mini and a lower end device overall. People need to learn how aspect ratios work. They see a 6.7" advertised diagonal on the iPhone and 8.3" diagonal on the mini. The 23% difference in diagonal doesn't translate to how much larger the surface area of the tablet is or inform you of how the aspect ratio affects common media.


It’s genuinely the perfect content-consuming device. Has always been my favorite form factor for gaming, traveling, note-taking, ebooks, and doing basically any task on the couch.


One super-niche that it fits into is apparently it‘s the perfect size for cockpit use


It’s the perfect size for me to read books and magazines on one handed and fits easily into my purse for travel.

Love my iPad mini.


Its larger screen is better suited for content consumption (especially reading and watching videos) and allows you to have two apps running side by side. 

A foldable iPhone is what I think you want.


I bought mine to use ForeFlight when I am flying. The iPad Mini is still almost too big for my new airplane. lol


For me it’s a reader device that does ebooks as well as RSS feed articles, read later apps, etc. 

It’s a much larger screen than even the Pro Max, and having a separate device for this use case without a bunch of social media apps and notifications is nice.


The iPhone Plus/Max is significantly smaller despite the diagonal size. 

iPad Mini is the only tablet in Apple’s lineup that you can actually hold with one hand. Thus it’s possible to use it while standing or moving around. The other iPads you can technically do the same by cradling it, but it’s not a comfortable experience at all. If you have Shaq hands it might be a different story.

Makes for an excellent portable note taking device or general media consumption device.


Not being condescending but if you have to ask that question, it is not for you genuinely.
But for most, it is perfect content consumption size. It is not large like regular iPad and not small like iPhone (even the max). It really feels nice to hold in both hands and is great for people into gaming on mobile devices.


I’d love to own one for reading comics and manga. My iPad Pro (11) is too unwieldy for me.

While I love my Kindle, any heavily illustrated ebooks look much better on a tablet.


The size is very portable for:

* Content consumption = e-books, films viewing, gaming?
* Hold in one-hand

Overall imho it is in the large smart phone category as for note taking and easier reading and even just typing the 11" screen is superior for productivity where it blends tablet size with laptop size and is distinct from smart phone size.

But I can easily see why people would think: "If I content consume on my phone why not the iPad Mini for better experience?" and buy one for travel every day. That makes sense if the money is there.


Because when I’m on my bed holding the ipad and i lose my grip and it falls to my face a mini hurts less than a full ipad


Fair enough, 120Hz would be a nice upgrade but I still don't understand why 120Hz is so sought after even in <$500 devices.


Apple waited 3.5 years going from the iPad mini 4 to mini 5, then 2.5 years from mini 5 to mini 6, another 2.5 years would be Q1 2024 for the mini 7


Tbh for me I’m fine with no face id as the 6 with no notch is nice. Touch id is not great but i really dont mind inputting the passcode if it means i get the whole screen


TouchID on the top power but. Works well. No FaceID


[deleted]


I don’t see OLED coming to iPads via the Mini first… but microLED seems reasonable. 

120hz is almost assuredly reserved for the Pro iPads


So many years after the A10X iPad Pro it hasn't budged to anywhere else in the line.  
 
Maybe there's a space for a Mini Pro?


copium


I don’t see it happening. Not unless they do an iPad mini pro, the 11” pro doesn’t even have the mLED, the hdr isn’t anywhere near the m1/2 12.9


You're think they're going to put a 120 Hz screen in a $500 iPad while keeping it out of iPhones which range in price from $800-1200?


Unfortunately, with Apple's stubbornness with only giving ProMotion/120Hz to Pro line devices, I don't foresee that happening.


Dreams are free!!


Yeah I had a first gen Pro 11” and honestly I don’t see myself ever buying a Pro again, especially now that I have a MacBook. The Mini is perfect for light browsing, sketching, note taking, etc, but those are things that benefit from a touch screen and pencil. Anything else I’d rather just do on my MacBook.


Honestly my Mini is already the perfect tablet for most people. Most people don’t care for 120 hz.


Why would an ipad need an always on display?


The iPad Mini is a premium model, essentially a iPad Air but smaller (hence mini name). It’s more expensive and fuller features than entry iPads and this is why I wouldn’t really be surprised if the M1 lands in there. 

I kind expect the A17 Pro instead to give the smaller battery in the iPad Mini a chance for a reasonable runtime. 

The battery in my opinion has been the weakest aspect of my mini 6. I came from a well used Mini 2 and the battery life on that was superb, especially the standby time.


The continued run of M1 makes me think that's what would go in this alleged budget/education mac model aimed at schools and chromebooks 
 
Hopefully that would also mean a very long, maybe the longest ever, support lifecycle for every AS Mac, as it's a bit icky how Intel macs with no technical barrier to entry are now being retired every year to sweep that along


I don’t really care about what exact chip it gets, I just want proper external display support.

My mini is perfect for content consumption which is like 95% of what I need any device for. But if i could plug it into my monitor to work on google docs and do some slightly heavier multitasking, it’d be really all I need.


It's not that bonkers. The A17 Pro already matches or beats it


Honestly I’m not sure why they put the m-series chips in iPads. Maybe they’ve just made so many. Until they overhaul iPadOS you’ve got a Ferrari with a 60mph governor. You have the capacity to do so much with an m1 in there but if the OS is gimped it’s just wasted


Why an M1?  The A17 outperforms it, and crushes it in performance-per-watt.  Even an A16 benchmarks higher for single core tasks which is I'm pretty sure is still the vast majority of tasks anyone would perform on an iPad.


I was expecting the M1 to come to the iPhone.


Mini 6 actually has an A15 chip which is what the m2 is based on. So going m1 is almost backwards. It would prob be A16 or A17. They cannot give it a full M chip unless we get a Mini Pro. Would love to have that 120hz screen, but it will prob be no less than $699.


[deleted]


Thats right challenge the tech wizaards at apple and see what kind of blackmagicfuckery they deliver.


Why can the iPhone use the A17 Pro then?


MiniLED and microLED are not the same thing, nor is the 12” iPad Pro’s screen even comparable to a top-of-line OLED television. The iPad’s screen is known for having “blooming” issues because there’s a limited number of dimming zones. The individual pixels cannot turn off like an OLED can. MiniLED is for all intents and purposes a stop-gap until Apple switches to OLED next year and then microLED in the future. 

And there’s no chance that the iPad Minj is going to get a microLED screen any time soon.


I don't care as long as it's one or the other


MicroLED doesn’t exist at this scale and size yet. 

I specifically would want an updated iPad Mini screen to do better in low light over having peak HDR performance for movies. I think that would make it a better reading device.


The ipadOS 17 fixed version of stage manager, and External display support. 

They’re limited to M1.


It's called \*Pro\*Motion. It only goes into the \*Pro\* products, so MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and iPhone Pro


It’s easy segmentation for them, if you want the nice screen you gotta spend more money.


It seems like if it’s in the same lineup they’d update them at the same time (like how the 14 and 16 inch MacBooks get updated at the same time) Keeping it at the same price point when new airs come out seems like it makes them a much worse deal. I get them being popular for technical field work but it seems like a steep price still comparatively.


I’m not arguing that it’s not useful or a bad product. Simply that the pricing doesn’t make sense next to the 10th Gen ipad. Better specs and larger screen could cost more… not less.


I have so many questions after reading your comment…


note taking and content consumption here :)

quick edit: I have really tiny hands, so it's perfect


Reading PDFs, podcasts, YouTube streaming to Apple TV, Wordle, email, messages, HomeKit, and testing IT stuff.


“It’s going to be the *best riot ever* and we’re gonna love it”


All I've ever wanted is a Mini Pro *anything*.


An iPad mini pro would be amazing though


iPad Pro will have Oled display and mini will have 120hz, fingers crossed


Than why they don’t make mini pro. Ppl want promotion and ready to pay for it ? Including me


iPad Pro will have Oled display and mini will have 120hz, seems legit


just for curiosity, what do you do with the lidar scan? I mean I have it's a nice feature but if It didn't come with it I would even notice


Better SoC, laminated display, 2nd Gen Pencil support


That was my point.


The iPad mini has always cost more than the base iPad. Hell, I’m pretty sure it (paradoxically) costs more than the iPad Air.


since Apple locked the full feature Stage Manager and external monitor support to M-series processors I would love to see the mini get an M1


At some point these use-cases become *absurd*.


If they don’t make a Pro version of the mini, then 90hz could be a good compromise.

If the next mini has a better display (OLED with at least 90hz) then I’m definitely getting it to replace my iPad Pro.


Dang, holding out for a new Pro and Pencil 3


Unless it's a simultaneous launch with the M3 Macs at an October event


Very few people would pay for iCloud if they gave 256GB for free lol. I could see 15GB or something, maybe even 50 if they’re feeling generous but no way they’d give that much cloud storage for free.


Hell even 50GB would be reasonable at this point.


Really? Free 256GB of cloud storage for everyone? 

You think that’s realistic?


Screen is fine, just give me Face ID


I'm also very happy with it and unlikely to need a 7... So it's more a case of could I be saving £100 by waiting a few weeks/months.


I’ve been using it since the mini 6 first came out and I’ve always had the brightness issue in daytime. I’ve also heard a lot of complaints as well, although I don’t see a lot of the brightness complaints from aviators in the general Apple sub.


> do you have an actual reason

The pencil. 60hz is slow for that.


It looks smoother is enough of a reason, they're premium devices and the cost of high refresh rate has commoditized down to far cheaper devices


I said 90hz.  I do not believe personally that 120hz is something people will need, but 90hz is a refresh rate I think would help tie the whole "clean and smooth" UI that iOS, macOS, and iPadOS go for. In addition, 60hz is an industry standard for smartphones that was dumped five years ago. There's also the fact that 60hz androids are criticized but for some reason when Apple releases another $800 60hz phone, it's skimmed over as "not vital to the user experience."


Granted it draws more power, a downclocked m1 would still be a beast. But whatever chips is in there, if it can do stage manager on external display, I would be happy.


Holy *shit* this comment just opened my eyes to the mini. Huh. Even having held a mini 6 before it didn’t really click for me, but when you put it side by side with their biggest phone it really *is* a bigger difference than I imagined. Thanks for that link! Reddit got rid of awards so here you go

✨🏅✨


Yea I’m sorta starting to get the appeal now. If I had the money probably something I’d consider getting.


Yeah, I think honestly one of the main draws is that I can comfortably type on it like I do with my iPhone - all the other iPads are just too big for that.

I used to have an iPad Air - an iPad that is technically much more capable - but I just actually use the mini way more than I ever used the air.


It’s comments like this that make me think about how big the world is, that some people just *have* a plane. So wild.


So my eyes don’t explode when using a screen.  I cannot use devices with constant scrolling without it.  It’s jarring.  120hz SHOULD be a standard in 2023.


So, you’re saying this could be released in the future?

Amazing.


understandable :D but I'd take the hideous notch over touchID still :D


i'm guessing 599 starting price, but we will get 128 gigs of base storage


Doesn't matter because Tim Apple thinks you're going to love it regardless!


with 120HZ display and an OLED screen it would not be able to keep that price point.


could it? Yes

Will it?

It‘s an apple product


>but can it keep the 499 price point?

haha ha ha 

and I thought my jokes were bad


MicroLED is absolutely not coming to the Mini. It costs considerably more than OLED, so much so that Apple can’t even begin to switch their more expensive products to it for another several+ years yet.

Do you mean MiniLED by any chance?


I think if anything, it would come to the iPad mini first because the jump from iPhone Plus or Max is not as big as regular iPads, and the mini is also positioned as a premium device.


I’d argue that it actually does make sense for the Mini. The standard and air? No. The mini supports the Apple Pencil though, and that is a really big place where 120Hz would be a huge boon to the feel of using the pencil. The standard and air don’t support it so it doesn’t matter as much imo.


If a mini pro means a more budget mini as well, I’m game. Love the size but wish it was closer to the normal entry level price.


I probably guess as the new standby feature. Would be useful if it is kept in the living room or in your study table


It looks so good when controlling speakers for instance. Like… why would a phone? It’s nice!


Why would any device need an always on display? I guarantee your iPhone is completely fine without one too.

Features on our electronics aren't "why", they are "why not"


Because it would look cool?


It’d be neat for StandBy mode. Would work well with the Smart Folio or any standing case.

Set it on your night stand and plug it in. And the mini acts as a smart clock and calendar.

The mini’s size makes it relatively useful for that. But I don’t see Apple doing it :(


I mean why not?


iPad mini 6 has the best battery life,especially while gaming, compared to the whole rest of the iPad line up.


>I kind expect the A17 Pro instead 

The A17 Pro is a more recent chip with its own production hiccups (hence the reason Apple uses the older chips on the base iPhones and why the 15 Pro seems to lightly overheat).

The M1 (or the A16) could be a better choice: no production slowdown, and the smaller screen of the mini enables the GPU to be less burdened...


I bought a third party cable online that can have your mini (or any lightning device) connect to a display while also supporting usb accessories and charging. So then I can plug my usb hub into it. Apple has never officially supported this kind of connection so it may be a tad sketchy but from my initial tests it worked, though sometimes I’d have to plug and re plug. For my iPad mini 5


I plug my mini 6 into a projector all of the time. I can’t adjust the volume on the mini, or the screen size/resolution though. Is that what you mean?


Because the M series is just a continuation of the A12X/Z. Been around for YEARSSS.


I didn’t know that. But I want the A17 for the ray tracing.
Crazy that the iPhone 15 pro outperforms my M1 MacBook Pro


Perhaps you forget what the M1 is.  

If you take an A14, and add two additional CPU cores (and extra GPU cores), it becomes an M1… 

If you take an A15, and add two CPU cores (and extra GPU cores), that’s an M2... 

They’re the same chip, but with duplicated parts to meet the needs of the device. The laptops have more space and battery so they get a slightly bigger version of the same chip. 

If they put two extra cores on the A18, it’ll still be an A18, and then they’ll put MORE cores on it and call that an M4.


I was more talking about OLED, though I also wouldn't be surprised if the power requirements of M1 were impractical for a smaller device.


Didn’t stop you from buying the original mini did it. But go ahead and tell your self you need these new features and upgrade your 1 gen old device as if we’re not rapidly depleting the Earth of these materials for “media consumption”


iPad Mini Pro confirmed!!


For some people money isn't the issue, it's the fact that you have to get the bigger device.

I'd love a mini ipad and mini iphone with 120hz screen, even if it was for pro max prices


200 usd more for m1 and pro motion would be tempting for me to but


Are you able to take regular phone calls on the mini?

Was also thinking of just grabbing one for the convenience of a larger screen and using it as exclusively my "home" device but was pushed away since the price was a bit high. Might grab the Mini 6 once prices drop.


"Over the past year, our users caused over a billion dollars in property damage"

*giant "1 Billion" text appears on backdrop*


I use it to scan objects and turn them into 3D assets. You can also scan environments to use in productions. Very versatile - look up luma AI and Polycam


Lidar scans are great for when you need to figure out where things are in empty 3D space - when doing camera tracking, only point I have are the one that camera saw - with this I can scan whole room and have one reference for all the other cameras so that everyting later on in CG lays in the same scale and space. I was imagining on having iPad Mini Pro and iPhone Mini. But that won't happen it seems.


Video editing is not absurd. ￼


Haha I am in the same boat, the prices are barely lower than after introduction so I would rather spend the full buck on a recently released device. I do not need it, but I want it, so I can wait


15GB is the sweet spot for a free tier at least for me.

When my family used Google Drive, I’d say about half of us easily hit our limit whereas others (namely parents) almost hit it.

50GB would be great though.

The free 5GB currently is completely pointless and I feel might lead to more frustration than anything for new Apple users.


Touch ID is fine, just give me M1.


I'm not an aviator so I'll take your word on it. I just assumed it had to be pretty decent since for years up there were pilots on this sub asking for apple to finally make a new mini. Hopefully the 7 will be brighter for you guys!


Oooo ok ok I see you - but the same could be said for the regular iPad too


That’s pretttttty subjective - I think 60hz looks… fine, and they’re not really that premium if they’re the entry-level devices, no?


There really is no “standard” here, a standard would require some sort of authority or governing body, which the smartphone industry does not have.

Animations on Android are simply inferior to iOS in general, which is why 60hz looks fine on iOS and can look bad on Android. 

I don’t disagree that 90hz would look better, I just don’t think the masses would care


It was built in the 40s and cost me less than my car. So it isn't fancy but I love it.

I wish it was a bit bigger though. lol


Oh grow up lmao


Why are you this way?


[deleted]


Thats a lot. Wasn’t the Mini originally supposed to be a low tier reasonably priced iPad. It was $329 at launch. $600 is bonkers and close to a regularly priced full size ipad..


[deleted]


YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT (you don’t have a choice)


Well it could. Plenty of other tablets can. But it would be in stark contrast with the way they usually overcharge for industry standards.


You’re thinking of micro*OLED*

They already have microLED in the bigger iPad Pro and the MacBook Pros and the 6K display



Edit: I did


It’s in the same league as the Air, I still think they’ll keep it for the pro. If they put 120hz in the mini/air there really would be even less incentive for the 11” air. 

They should keep the pro limited to 12.9, rebrand the 11” pro as the air, and then do the mini as a smaller variant of the air at that point. The iPad lineup right now is extremely convoluted


[I think they do?](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/)


My phone is sitting on my desk for half the day and it's nice to glance at the time/weather/notifications without picking it up. I can't think of any instance where I wished my iPad did the same. I get if you are using it for a more niche purpose maybe, but I don't see how they are comparable.


And useful. That's my favorite feature on the newer iPhones. Too bad they won't release foldable.


Standby mode isn’t useful enough yet. It needs more third party widgets before it gets a giant screen. 

The fact that the photo standby mode requires your phone be unlocked is a horrible design choice.


Does it really? I would have thought the fingerprint iPad would


You’re making expectations without knowing its history. The iPad mini 6 got the A15 a month before the iPhone did.


Why not m2? The m1 is a few years old at this point and the m2 has been around almost a year


"production hiccups" mean they'll just go with an A17 instead of the A17 pro. I think that's the reason they named it that way tbh. One less GPU core and maybe a tad slower clock speeds.


Yeah I wouldn’t call that proper support at all. The airs and pros can connect to a monitor to extend the display - not just mirror - and the ui properly fills the full display size.


I think the M1 still outperforms it for multi-core tasks but those are a still a minority even on a PC, let alone an ipad.


True, the features that came out after the mini didn’t exist when I bought the mini. It’s Apple that is limiting those features to newer hardware. But it’s not going to be e-waste because I’m going to give the 6 to my girl.￼


depending on your carrier, yes - on iPhone check for Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling

look at the bottom for "Add Wi-Fi Calling For Other Devices"

there's also an iPad-native Google Voice app, if you're a GV user


Wanting computer level video editing on a mini tablet is silly. 

Next someone is going to say that they run several virtual machines on their mini-iphone and think that the next one should support more ram for their use-case.


The 5GB is basically just to allow people to use iCloud to sync messages and settings. It's a taster to get people addicted to cloud storage lol.

Apple's subscription plans are completely WACK though and not a good deal in my eyes. Their cloud subscription is overpriced considering you'd get the same price plus the full MS Office suite with Microsoft. Apple One is even more overpriced considering AppleTV barely has any content and who tf uses apple arcade? Apple News+ and Music are why I pay for Premier and only makes sense since I share my subscription with my wife because I'd be mega ripped off if I was paying for a solo subscription. The base tier is $17 for Apple Music, TV+ and 50GB with NO News?? They practically force you to Premier.


The processor is fine, just let me fold it in half.


Yeah but for that size, the pro 11" exists. 

Only iPad size that doesn't have a 120hz option is the mini


The Mini is priced like a premium product considering the regular iPad is larger and cheaper


are we really going for semantics now? USB-C was an industry standard for years with apple being basically the only outlier (now it's a *standard* standard). Industry standards are things that everyone does because it's objectively better, like an ultrawide lens, usb-c, high refresh rate, etc. I mean if you had to pick between two identical phones; to battery life, resolution, weight, etc., with the only difference being 60hz vs 90hz, what would you choose?


That’s amazing, really. I just spent a week at an island airfield for a classic sports car race, and the planes (and the cars) people owned there were just like amazing. It’s truly *amazing* the lives some people live.

Oh, yeah, I’m really stoned right now, too. Might have a bit to do with it.


Grow up?  What the fuck does that even mean.


sure beats the alternative of 599 with 64 gigs, which is also a possibility, sadly :(


It is a lot, but the mini 6 was 500, because it was a premium device, just small. It's not a small iPad, it's a small iPad Air


I love my Mini 6 but I’ve quickly hit the point where I need a 512gb+ storage since I use it so much.


That’s miniLED. microLED is the next step from OLED.


No the iPad and MacBook pros have mini led.


miniLED and microLED are different. Go look it up lol


Oh look at that. I actually forgot the Air line supports the pencil. I’ll eat crow I guess lol


Some people use iPads as like home control or display devices and I could see it being useful for that


Smaller screen less battery consumption


Most things run on a lower resolution and at capped 60 hz.


Fingerprint ipad? The iPad mini 6 uses your fingerprint so what do you mean by that?


Back then base iPhones had the same chip as the Pro…


Supply chain: the M1 uses an older (aka cheaper) kind of technology; also the Air uses the M1, still.


We will see, but not this year for another A17…


Fair enough. I hope the seven has that kind of support as well 😁


ooh yeah. that would make sense due to sheer number of cures. but single core performance. I gotcha.


Apple Premier feels like a great deal for my family and I. It’s only about $7 for each of us and it’s actually quite a lot of value.

We all use Apple Music and tv+ and to a lesser extent Apple Arcade (currently playing Stardew Valley and Hello Kitty Island Adventure—but Apple for sure needs to increase its value with more games).

And Fitness+ I use just for the treadmill and Mindful Cooldown exercises, but I definitely want to invest more time into it.

For News+ it’s actually the opposite for me because I find it a bit useless for my reading habits.

I appreciate what is on there, but I’d love for more publications to hop on the service (The Economist and the NYT are the two I desperately want that aren’t on there, unless they’ve been added recently?).

But overall I think it’s quite a good deal. Because on top of all the above, we all use a LOT of the iCloud storage (collectively we’ve used 900+ GB so far and I expect that number to increase once I get my hands on Spatial Videos).


Everything is fine, just buy the 6.


Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


There’s a higher cost to miniaturization of components… 

Shoving the same stuff into a smaller body is more challenging


USB-C is controlled by the USB-IF, a standards body. There is no “Smartphone-IF” that collaborate this way to set “standards”

This isn’t *semantics* bud, there is an actual difference in kind.


It means your eyes aren’t actually going to explode and you’re being dramatic and childish


What the hell is the MicroOLED in the Apple vision? This is getting as bad as the usb-c nomenclature.


😔


This is what I meant


Thanks dude, the 17 other comments didn’t cover this point enough, glad you felt like you had to pile on


But also less space for batteries?


screen area grows quadratically and battery volumes grows cubically though


Oh I meant the base model iPad. Forgot my mini takes fingerprints. It’s easy to forget when it’s not on the front


And my axe!


Giggity


that's literally not what I mean. That's not what an industry standard is, it's an "an established standard, norm, or requirement in a particular area of business." USB-C was never required until recently, it was just the norm for smartphone companies.


I’m sorry you have trouble understanding sarcasm.  Apple apologists are the worst.


Micro-OLED is the same as a typical OLED but fabbed on silicon like a CPU at small sizes (hence micro) whereas typical OLED is on a larger sheet of glass. Already widely available in the electronic viewfinders of mirrorless cameras.


miniLED and microLED are differemt things. Please look it up


Gotta love pedantic Reddit users


Assuming they maximize the space which is not always the case

I think battery life is the same according to apple


Ah 😊


I genuinely can't tell if you are being sarcastic and don't think 120hz is special at all or if you don't know the meaning of the word sarcasm and meant hyperbole instead.


I don’t think you know what sarcasm means.


For me, these pro tablets fall short in their own ways.

The Surface Pros are trash-tier tablets, but can at least be used like a regular laptop because of Windows.

The iPad Pro dunks on any other tablet, but is too limited to replace a Windows/MacOS device for my usage.


Surfaces have always been pretty bad tablets, but they're decent laptops with the keyboard case.

iPad Pro hardware is incredible, it's just so limited in what it can do by the OS and software. What makes Surface interesting is being able to run the full desktop software as a laptop, with the side benefit of being a tablet. Using it only as a tablet is terrible.


I used to see as many surfaces in Starbucks as iPads if not more. I wouldn't exactly say that they lost.


This article sounds like it's coming from someone that does zero work on their tablet/laptop.

I own an iPad. I like it a lot.


It's terrible for workflows. Just the multi tasking itself isn't intuitive. On windows it's a quick snap into any quadrant. Simple.

On the iPad it's unintuitive gestures that I can't seem to remember how to use every time I want to get another app up lol.


As someone who converted from iPad to surface I would say that it comes down to your usecase and needs. I use a tablet to read, browse the web and watch videos and take handwritten notes/markup pdfs. For all of this, there are quite usuable and touch-friendly apps on windows and iPadOS. But I use a laptop for literature management, scientific writing, layouting and research. There are tools for these tasks on both platforms but iPadOSes tools offer far less integration (i.e. reference managers can't auto cite while I write in pages or word, no possibility to compile R-Markdown to PDF) or are just not there (no R-Markdown, no F4-Transcript). So I can either use an iPad and another computer OR just a surface. I decided on the latter because I personally don't like switching between two devices.


They can run windows 10 on the surface. Hardware doesn’t mean shit if you aren’t offering a competitive OS.

I also can’t get the article to load. It’s just a blank white screen. Hopefully the author isn’t comparing the iPad purely on a hardware basis. That would be really lazy.


People speak about “obliderate”, “ruin”, “destroy” when it comes to varying products. 

What’s likely happening is people who like iPad will keep using iPad. People who like windows will keep using windows. 

Never understood “loyalists” taking sides. Apple or Microsoft isn’t cutting you a check to shill out free advertising for them. Just be happy with your purchase and move on with life


I have been involved in online chat groups since the mid 1980’s....  it is amazing that the same arguments have not changed in the Microsoft vs Apple wars, just new players


Let's play a game - I give you a sealed envelope with a random task that you can't know before picking a device.

I guarantee you won't pick the iPad and you'll probably reach for the Windows device in order to maximize the chances of completing that task.

Personally I don't particularly like the Surface, but I understand it's philosophy.


Apple can’t even keep up with the iPad anymore.

They release a Smart Keyboard and the implementation is rubbish. The touchbar that shows up at the bottom of the screen covers UI elements and is just generally horrible. Please please please, I hope it’s better in iPadOS 15! Would also like for that mini floating keyboard to be usable, too!


>	So, the iPad Pro has a more modern operating system

Lol. As if this matters at all when it's still locked to only running iOS apps.

>	It’s hard to argue why anyone should get a Surface Pro 7 when Apple has accomplished what it has

Double lol. If you need to do any serious work, it's not going to be on an iPad.


If I could only have a phone and a tablet (no computer, no laptop, etc.), I’d get a Surface. iPadOS still feels like a toy to me and sometimes productive stuff doesn’t work on it / is still unsupported, like handling class-oriented websites, bibliographies on Word, and even printing (I have an AirPrint printer that didn’t work with my 2018 iPad Pro, used to work all the time on my 2015 MacBook Pro). So the Surface would be the best bet for me. 

But since it’s obviously not like that, I’m more than happy with using my Mac as my productivity machine and my iPad as my entertainment machine. Would love to see an M1 iPad running a more desktop-class OS though.


Let me know when the iPad start running full touch MacOS,
 that Apple can’t deliver. Windows and Surface are over a decade ahead when it comes to that.


ITT: people that think iPad customers are the same segment as surface customers. LOL


Contextual OS would be nice. Plug in a keyboard and mouse, connect a monitor. Bam. It switches to MacOS. Unplug it and it switches to iPadOS. I think the only reason we haven’t seen this is that it would cannibalise laptop sales.


But at least Microsoft can run a real general purpose OS on its hardware...


i dont really think they were ever trying. i mean yeah, they would love to sell as many surface tablets as iPads..but the way they are made they are clearly not after the same audience that iPads are. Its funny because apple fans tout how much more iPads/Apple Watches/whatever apple product sells but for the most part no one makes a direct competitor to Apples products except for the phones and a few watch makers out there.


Macbooks may be better (in terms of performance, overall experience, etc.) than Surfaces, but iPadOS is holding the iPad quite a lot in terms of software compared to any desktop OS. The fact that you can't open Zoom while you do other stuff in the iPad illustrates that despite having some cool apps and quirks that profit from the iPad size/performance, at a low level iPadOS is still an smartphone OS. It'd had no place in my workflow because of this reason. An iPad with desktop class multitasking that could run macOS apps would be awesome.


[deleted]


I find my iPad to be so redundant. There’s nothing my iPad does that a computer / phone can’t. I don’t do any creative work, so I really want to sell my iPad Pro I used for college. I find myself using my surface pro way more because (like all the other comments are saying) the os.


“*Apple can put MacOS on an iPad…but they won’t!”*

*”iPad doesn’t do anything and Apple wants you to replace your computer with an iPad!”*

Well, which one is it? So many strange debates here when, in the actual current state, these device experiences are really different. Most people seem to get that.


I have seen plenty of people finish their whole degree (even engineering) with a Surface. Good luck with an iPad.

I love my iPad pro and can’t imagine studying without it. But it is just not comparable to the Surface.


Except iPadOS is no where close to aj amazing software to replace a laptop, unless you use a laptp to watch movies a surf the web, but than again a surface wil give yout that and more.


Without MacOS and desktop apps iPad will always be just an expensive toy.

Im a designer and have 2 MacBooks and a first gen iPad Pro. I will never buy another iPad pro because I can’t do my work on an iPad and “pro” has literally the same functionalities as non pro ipads.


We had a discussion in another thread the other day, how iPad can finally catch-up to Surface by running macOS on iPad. 

And now this. 

LOL.


The article makes it sound like Microsoft was copying Apple’s iPad when in fact Bill Gates went all in on tablets in 2002 with Windows XP Tablet Edition.


They don't need to. Surface devices are *far more capable*.

Just yesterday I had to check the response codes on a website and there was no way to do it on the iPad. I had to get the MacBook and check with Firefox developer menus. Some "pro" device with desktop class browser.


Wow I have been out of the tablet game for probably 4 years but before then I would have always chose a Surface over a iPad for a tablet.


I believe they’re going to allow MacOS apps to run on iPads. iOS apps are already running on macs, why not the other way? 

If this actually happens, I’ll stop asking for MacOS on the iPad.


How? It's not like Apple changes anything


What even is this post..the markets are totally different, users are different, devices are different. 

It's like comparing a hammer to a swiss army knife and saying one is better.


M1 chips are really nice. But what are they for in an iPad if you're not editing pictures and not rendering videos? What will you be using the lots of cores of CPU, GPU and AI? MacBook? I totally get it. iPad? Not so much.


In this thread the difference between apple users who only use apple products for streaming movies and social media vs apple power users who use it to program apps, create content and other general heavy processing based things.


I would abandon iPad and switch to a Surface once the Surface Pro X hardware and eco system are matured.


Put Logic or Final Cut on the iPad, make it able to run Pro apps. Otherwise it’s not “Pro”


I remember the days when I'm rooting so hard for Windows Phone to succeed. maybe history will repeat itself?


iPadOS is still designed to be used for mobile applications. 
The main difference is here on surface tablets you can install any win32 application like on desktop but on iPad you can only install apps that are also on iphone. The iPad was always just a bigger iPhone with a option to attach a keyboard, for like MS Word or something. It probably works for many users to do work on it, but not for me.
I am using the iPad only for browsing, Zoom calls and watching videos in the train.


Disagree. Microsoft Surface does have a niche as a laptop/tablet with access to games, but purely as a tablet iPads with the new M1 chip with dominate the tablet marketplace. Their tablet product line is beyond strong top to bottom with accessories that help develop demand for their products in multiple demographics and spaces.


Deep.


You don’t say


I am because the app that I have to use for my living isn’t available outside of iOS


Never could


As a gnu/linux on pc and android on mobile user I can say apple is really doing great with their tablets. If I would buy a tablet, it would be ipad.


I’ve used both, the Surface is a great option for a very portable laptop for an affordable price. Just don’t use it like a tablet.

iPad pros are great too but if you’re a person that does “regular” / laymen things like excel and whatnot the surface is a actually better (for people that don’t want to learn how to use an iPad “properly”)


The truth is that iPadOS is holding back the iPad. It is not a laptop replacement just yet. There is light at the end of the tunnel though, in my experience I do my work solely on Google Suite and using safari I could be able to pull a full days work just fine. But it’s sad that we have to jump through hoops to do that.


When has Microsoft ever “kept up” with iPad?


Tablets like the iPad and Surface have certain compromises that prevents me from ever using them as my only computer. For iPads, that would be certain software limitations, and we all have our own gripes about them. For the Surface, the main problem I’ve always had with them is that their hardware and software are at odds against each other. Windows 10 was designed for laptops and desktops but the Surface has a tablet form factor. As result, you get a crappy tablet experience due to the unintuitive UI and lack of touch-optimized apps; and you get a crappy laptop experience because the form factor is just not comfortable enough to be used on your lap.


It’s the fate of trying to make an OS that’s works on computers and laptops. It just doesn’t work. Period.


This comparison has been pointless for almost 5 years now, the Surface Pro is a pc in a tablet form factor, the iPad is a tablet.

Despite the progress Apple has made recently the iPad still isn’t as good of a pc as the Surface Pro, but the iPad has always been a better tablet and that lead has only gotten even wider.


People seem overly focused on the iPadOS/MacOS thing. They’ll just use the same ability to run iOS apps on the mac the other way around. The goal is to let developers create an app that’s usable for the three environments (iOS, iPadOS, MacOS).

Here’s the catch: It’ll be mostly MacOS, but with AppStore apps only. Over time, that’ll be the practical difference between iPadOS and MacOS.

I’m thinking they’ll add a better file system and cross compatibility for apps (limited to apps that follow some touch target guidelines) in the next update.


iPad dominates the tablet sector.

Nothing comes close to its performance or screen quality.


Okay, I need to go to sleep. I thought that said iPod. I was worried I'd accidentally traveled back in time.


The hardware in the iPad Pro is great. But wake me up when we can do real work on it.


They never could.


Windows 10X will limit you to apps you buy from the Microsoft Store.

Yeah, that's not happening.  There are precious few reasons to run Windows but one of them is it's cheap, your older family members could navigate it, and you can get what you need *somewhere*.  If (or when) they remove both of those in yet another misguided attempt to ape Apple, it will be . . well, let's look at how the article references Windows 8:

>. . . Windows 8, a version of the OS that will go down in infamy. It had  separate touch-centric and desktop environments that worked completely  differently from each other. . .  Windows RT was even worse because it looked exactly like Windows 8,  including the desktop environment, but it didn’t have support for  desktop apps.

Also it won't be out this year anyway.  Microsoft's deal with the devil is going to come due sooner or later, and it just might be sooner.


I used to own a surface pro and can completely say that they are absolutely garbage in comparison to iPads and MacBooks. They are buggy and their battery decays quickly from what I have found. That’s why I swapped over to Apple and ditched my surface


Microsoft had a tablet?


In term of hardware: yes. In term of usability: iPad is a too powerful machine with limited application. It still need full OS instead of consumption-only iOS, need keyboard & trackpad/mouse which is still a more effective input method over pen/touchscreen, need a surface-like kickstand (can't let it lay flat all the time, right?)

From personal perspective I think a new iPad mini with small bezel and improved pen experience will be even more useful than iPad Pro.


> Microsoft clings to its legacy software

Somebody has to. It's Microsoft's strength. It's no perfect because they tend to make a new "legacy" every few years, but so far it works fine.


What a dumb headline LOL. 

They are in two different classes. The iPad destroys any android tablet. Android is lost. Not Microsoft.


[deleted]


Come back when iPadOS can actually handle real work without needing specialized apps from the App Store.


They have never kept up. All they did was make a shitty tablet and called it a PC


As someone who is forced to use Windows for work everyday... I have no idea why people would choose to do that to themselves.


ITT: loads of people larping as 'professionals' even though they bought hardware without checking it would do what they need first and people who think buying something with 'pro' written on it means they're magically a pro lol


surface has always been awful. its a bad tablet, bad computer and ipad really doesn't need to go down that route.


For folks who want an iPad Pro run MacOS, can you explain a bit more why? Is it to just be able to develop apps on it? Wouldn’t that just cannibalize their MacBook line?


I mean the Surface or the Envy is a better iPad device than the iPad... and it actually runs desktop apps.


Ain’t that the truth


Wow, I thought there were Android fanboys, now Windows too...


no one can. ipads are in its on planet. there is nothing the competition can do to catch up


[deleted]


I still don't see the point of a tablet


Who can while my iPad 7th with Apple A10 is still fast enough that I dont want to upgrade. I bought for 250$, imagine how bad Android tablet or Windows machine at that price


[deleted]


Of course they can’t. Microsoft products usually aren’t thought out and are gimmicky. 

Look at their surface tablet. Large bezels and also expensive 

And cortana


Nor with Mac OS or IOS.


I wouldn’t write off the surface just yet. Microsoft is following Apple’s lead and designing their own processors to rival the M1. Its still early days and will take a few years, but not only will this make the big wigs at Intel commit seppuku having lost both of their biggest clients, but it could potentially help to iron out a lot of the faults that Windows has. Building hardware and components around the OS usually results in a much smoother user experience.


I'll still never buy one


I’d buy an M1 iPad Pro that could run MacOS in a heartbeat…


This is such a bizarre thing to attack. A huge part of why the surface has been successful has been because it specifically targets the business/student market that wants a laptop that doubles as a tablet. Apple has been specifically avoiding doing this, because the business market largely chooses Windows for its massive software catalogue, and no amount of quality in the Ipad's operating system is going to change that.


The surface pro is a shitty tablet that can run desktop apps

The iPad pro is a kick-ass tablet that can run bigger phone apps


I'm so pissed that Apple removed the ability to sideload a virtual machine onto iPads, even if you have an Apple developer account.

I could at least get real work done in my Linux distros.


As much as I wanted to stay within the Apple ecosystem, the iPad doesn’t come close to the Surface Pro. Sure the iPad is a better tablet, but the Surface Pro can be a tablet, laptop, and a computer (when hooked up to an external monitor). It’s really the best of all worlds, which makes up for the tablet experience, which isn’t thaaat bad.

And the kickstand… genius.


>The iPad Pro dunks on any other tablet, but is too limited to replace a Windows/MacOS device for my usage.

Everyone knows this. Apple knows this. I fully expect huge changes at WWDC, they just got ahead on the hardware and will catch up on the software about a month after tons of developers get their hardware.


I'd apple pencil as good as the pixel sense screens and surface pen? I'm really enjoying it.

No tachiyomi on iPad so really no point when my tablets primary use is reading manga...


I’m usually an Apple person, but I disagree wholeheartedly about the Surface Pro. I’ve had one since 2018 and always thought it felt like it came from an alternate universe where Jony Ive worked for Microsoft. It’s not as good for content consumption as an iPad Pro, but for actual work it blows it out of the park, and it’s still decent as a tablet.


How is the iPad Pro limited???  Big part of my professional life and different from a notebook, yes, but not limited. 

Office, Design Software, planning, notes, meetings and now even Coding all on my iPad Pro. Where exactly is the limit?? 
You can even use a mouse and keyboard if you think that is good idea. 

Right now working with Figma on an iPad Pro. Framer, lightroom do I need to go on? 


You know what is limited? Microsoft Ecosystem. Windows has to go. This costs us so much money in the company, so much time, so much hassle. Terribly inefficient, bad machines, and a chaotic, insecure OS. 
The windows tablets especially are hot at nothing, because they try to be everything.


Exactly windows is janky garbage the tablet mode is a joke many people dual boot with Android or Chrome os to have a usable tablet mode. Then you have to deal with all the windows issues and incompatibilities


As a happy owner of both iPad and Surface Pro, yeah I agree.

Neither of them has yet to strike the perfect balance that excels in both being a laptop for productivity and tablet for media consumption.


As someone who works in IT at a fairly large health network, Surfaces are super popular for their size and power. They are rarely used as tablets but are really good laptops with touch screens. I use a Surface Laptop 3 for work and it's probably the closest competitor to a MacBook I've ever used (in a good way). Surface Pros are basically just a smaller, more portable version of that.

So I'd say Microsoft can't keep up with the tablet scene, but they are killing it in the touchscreen laptop scene. Or laptop scene in general.


Yeah, I use Windows 10, macOS, Linux Mint, iOS, and Samsung Androids.

Let me tell you: I am shocked to say that now Windows 10, Linux Mint, and Samsung's OneUI 3.1 have a better UI than macOS and iOS.

How in the world did this happen? I don't know.

Yes, this is opinion. But, I feel like my opinion should be the opposite.


For a long time when they were down on power in the 90s and early 2000s Apple beat the drum of, essentially: it's not a about the power, it's what you can do with it.  That point was right then, and it is right now.  Apple can keep putting in hardware that is better than anything you can find anywhere else, but in the end the iPad's issue has long been software, specifically workflow.


Yup, i have Apple everything and you could even call me a fanboy. But the iPad Pro is the absolute worst for any professional workflow or multitasking. I’ve tried so many times to get it to work because a touchscreen would be fantastic for what I do. But it’s so frustratingly limited for how much power it has. This M1 in the iPad Pro is so unexciting. The iPad Pro is and always has been fast, that has never been the problem.


It's definitely usecase. As an actor I can record, edit, and send work on the iPad. It's my full computing device.


The reason you may see the white screen is due to content blocker enabled. 1Blocker considered the entire article/site as an ad, for me. 😅


Am an avid user of both iPads/iPhones and Surface devices, but if I'm going on a trip and need to bring *one* device, it's going to be the Surface every time. 

Let's be honest here, most tablets are used for web browsing, Reddit, Youtube/Netflix, and *maybe* note-taking. The Surface can do all of these just fine. Anything more serious you're grabbing a keyboard, at which point Windows 10 is just far better than iPadOS.


Stop bringing logic into this!


But I DO enjoy shitting on Apple for its ridiculous UI, UX and design in general. I am not even being sarcastic.


At my job, there are people who use a Surface as their primary machine. I've never seen such a thing with an iPad.


Ipad for entertainment and Surface for anything else.

I have a magic keyboard and an ipad pro. Its still no comparison to my ancient Surface Pro 3 in terms of productivity.


The surface is a more general purpose computing device, that's what you're saying. The idea is to have a laptop for certain tasks and the iPad for others, to let each excel at their respective tasks. Nobody should be recommending an iPad as a computer replacement. It's just the best tablet, by far, in the market. So if you want to do tablet things, it's the best experience. I'd rather use a MacBook or iPad, depending on the task, than a surface for any of them.


While this is true, that's like asking me to pick a single kitchen implement to cook an unknown recipe. While if I had to pick one I might pick a spoon, but that's because I don't want to stir with a knife, not because I think a spoon is a good carrot chopping tool. 

Or for those who don't cook, if I was buying a new car to suit all possible needs, I would buy a truck. That doesn't mean I actually want to drive a truck the majority of the time.


Does anyone know what task could be in this envelope that an iPad could do but a Surface couldn't?

Only thing I can think of is if it's very specific to the apple ecosystem (like using airplay or something).


I could easily pick an iPad to do any task that is within my scope of responsibilities at work.  I can VPN, SSH, RDP/AWS Workspaces, respond to emails, join meetings, edit documents, code, edit diagrams, etc.   The only thing I cannot do is launch locally is VMs/Containers, or host a local repo.  As long as I have connectivity then I am set.

When I am OnCall I keep my iPad near me when not at home just because I can respond to any Production issue without needing to bring a laptop.

Having an iPad Pro, MBP and a Surface on my desk at home I can switch to what fits best.  But honestly the Surface is only used for hosting random VMs, or other emulators that don't have a macOS version like PCem.


 I’d def pick the iPad.


I’d choose the iPad


Ah yes, the typical way we work.


I'll definitely be picking an iPad. Every working task I have can be completed on an iPad. "Work" doesn't mean heavy computing for everyone.


You can turn that bar off. I have. 

Thing that irks me is that it should appear for password manager entry on any password input type.

I hope ipad OS 14 was a trial run as they standardized the powerhouse within devices in preparation of a killer, cross-platform ios 15?


Exactly. Aside from email/light browsing/creating, the iPad is useless for much work. 

Just even trying to do testing as a student (Proctorio, etc) is impossible because it doesn’t work on the Chrome app. 

Word on my iPad Pro is a joke, and the great hardware is handicapped by iPadOS


[deleted]


>If you need to do any serious work, it's not going to be on an iPad.

Not. Everyone. Is. A. Programmer.


I do serious work on my iPad, what are you talking about?


I don't even really find it to be a great entertainment machine. Too big to use in bed, none of the keyboards balance well in the lap, so then you're left with either holding it up which causes your arms to get tired, or holding it in your lap which causes neck strain. I just don't find it useful for hardly anything aside from PDF reading, handwriting notes (stopped doing this when I graduated), and drawing (never really got into this). Despite my perceived flaws of the form factor, something makes me want to use it regardless. Idk if it just looks pretty, feels smooth, if Apple's marketing gets to me, or if it's just hearing everybody on /r/iPad rave about it and how they use it for everything.


Apple doesn’t wanna deliver, not that they can’t. 

Just remember the MacOS guys are the ones that wrote iOS for the phone and iPad.


[deleted]


Yet I switched from Surface to Ipad. I am the same customer?


You just invented Windows 10


And cannibalise App Store sales if people are free to install whatever


The OS is just so cumbersome on the Surface. My Surface pro 3 couldn't handle 5 years of use.


> I don't think anyone really see Microsoft as necessarily trying to compete for laptops and tablets? That's not how they are perceived anyways. They don't really put any effort lol

I think this is largely because they don't want to alienate their own OEM partners. Therefore Microsoft's market is mainly the premium market (like Apple). Enterprises do seem to like the Surface series. I've seen executives using Surface Pros which makes sense given that Windows is far more capable than iPadOS will ever be.

Apple may won the tablet space but that is only the consumer side. Rarely iPads are used in enterprise environments.


>The only reasons a few macbooks are bought for a software development team is to equip some of the staff with the mean to make a build for iOS. They still need the versatility of booting on win10 to run softwares that might only run in the OS and to test the software on Win10.

On the contrary, a lot of dev teams use Macs for web development because of macOS and the software available for it. Not because they want to boot Windows 10.

>That's right. Macbooks in those cases are only bought due to anti-trust issues since they are a forced hardware requirement set by Apple.

This makes no sense.


That’s the reason why I haven’t gotten an iPad or any tablet in all these years.


GoodNotes5 (or Notability) with an Apple Pencil is the ultimate school device. If it weren't for programming I'd be computerless at university.

You actually remember more (statistically) if you write it down instead of typing since your brain is doing more work having to write a sentence.

But that's my use case that I thought could interest you (since you mentioned college)

Edit: just saw you said "used" in past tense. You working now?


There’s lots your iPad does that a computer/phone can’t. 


It’s basically all creative work, which you mentioned you don’t do, but it still can do it. 


Also, I think the iPad is great as a social media/reading device. I read books on it. I browse reddit on it. I do most of my social media on my iPad because it’s awkward on a computer and the phone size is too small for that. 


Now, I’m not saying you need your iPad. You likely don’t. But there are real use cases for it


Dont design with a stylus first?


They could catch up but they still won’t have an Esc key on their keyboard, nor F keys for that matter.


But they had the wrong approach.  It was a desktop OS with touch slapped on.  Apple realized simplifying the barrier of entry would pay off


Just saw your review in wallstreetbet abt inflation and  wanted to inform you personally now all hedger , stackers , trader of precious metals at WallStreetSilver subreddit bro  😎 May June big news are waiting all of us thanks


WWDC hopefully will reveal more…


You are right, we really need a powerful ARM chip to compete with Apples M1. If we got such a chip, then its game over for ipad and switch.


Xcode too while you’re at it


I think the problem with this approach is that people who are actually trying to get work done (depending on their workflow) won't be able to if they're limited to app store software. 

Think of all the smaller pieces of a toolchain people use in daily workflows for software development, video editing plugins, music editing plugins, etc. If you're at all limited to an app store you're going to be hamstrung to the point of wanting an "actual computer" at that point (unless a lot of things change, possible but pretty unlikely imo). 

Then there's the windows management multitasking bit. It's just not great on iPadOS.


>Nothing comes close to its performance or screen quality.

They do lead in performance but you can certainly argue for Samsung devices on display quality.


I don’t disagree with you, that it won’t be able to compete with Apple, but it isn’t meant to. It is meant to compete with ChromeOS, which has been killing it in education. For that to have any chance, the hardware has to be really really cheap, so you wouldn’t want to run win32 applications on it anyway. I doubt they’ll succeed, though.


I can’t believe I actually considered buying a Surface RT.


Yeah the surface... with an i3 and 4gb of ram for the base model... at $749


People wonder why Apple isn't putting macOS on the iPad, but then look at the Surface and other Windows tablets/convertibles and how terrible they are to use and don't see the comparison.


I used windows for years. Never touched a MacBook. 


Until about a month ago. I now struggle with using windows on my gaming machine and work machine. You don’t know how many times I hit alt + space to bring up Alfred/spotlight. I hate it


Worst app you can run on Windows 10.... wait for it... Outlook! WTF this is such a shit app! Unfortunately I need this on my desktop or the IT goons will come by and break your fingers. The web version runs better via Firefox than the Windows binary.


I work with windows everyday and on my work laptop it’s not a great experience. Hammered down by IT with constant updates, too little ram, VPN. My gaming pc however has been great with Windows 10 and I prefer it these days to MacOS. Different strokes.


I feel yah. My company uses a proprietary software built on Windows and it’s a pain to use Windows compared to being able to use a Mac.


I feel the same with Mac OS. 

Mac OS has got to be the most useless os ever.

Its great for monkeys though

Edit: Oh my god I just realized I said this in the apple sub. RIP my karma


I would gladly switch my work Mac for a 15 year old Windows.

Macs are bad for working effectively, efficiently and fastly. Why the buttons so tiny on the windows of any app on Mac? What does that achieve? They look ugly, are hard to reach and don't function as any normal person would expect.


As a creative professional, being able to run Mac apps on a device that also has an excellent tablet and extremely accurate screen would be huge.

Yes it would probably cannibalize sales, but I personally would be likely to spend more for a higher specced iPad Pro (1tb+ ssd for the 16gb of ram) if it could run more professional creative software.


The iPads from last year beat it, the 2021 iPads definitely beat it. Who cares if it has Dex? That’s not more than a half baked solution to running a desktop OS on a tablet. 

iOS is still more user friendly and smoother than UI 3.0 of whatever it’s called now. The iPad will get updates longer, last year’s processor will still probably beat anything out in a android tablet 2 years from now. The M1 chip will probably go 3 to 5. I mean hell the A13 is just as fast and in some cases faster than the top of the line Snapdragon produced this year.


“virtually irreparable”

I don’t think this is the point you wanna make when comparing to Apple devices, especially since the Surface Pro has replaceable SSDs now...


>	Large bezels and also expensive

>	and cortana 

This is not the hill to build your argument on


Oh no, this will impact forecasts so much!


Same. If they ever allowed dual booting—*even with touch disabled like in Sidecar, and required connecting to a keyboard & a pointer device*—I’d still want one, as to have the option of having a complete desktop environment when needed

Though I know this most likely won’t happen

Btw. Apple argues that macOS isn’t designed for touch and it’s bad UX to run it on iPad, sure, disable touch when booting into macOS then. I wouldn’t mind. 

But it’s rather obvious apple wants to sell more devices, as there are people who might need/want both, also, ipad & pencil still provide by FAR the best drawing experience on any device ever—speaking as a long time digital artist, even wacom is shit in comparison—but I still need the full adobe suite for all design works, so I’m one of those who buy both mac and ipad. By allowing macOS on iPad, chances are the already slim market share Macs have now would only dip further. It’s the same reason why they really won’t give up Lightning, saving the planet is just a convenient PR excuse which happens to be a legit thing


I'm guessing at WWDC we'll hear about a iPadOS update that will let you run (some) MacOS apps on iPad Pro with M1.  Probably App store only, along with some API restrictions.


[deleted]


I feel like you’ve missed a major point of the article...

> *The Cupertino firm has spent over a decade taking a modern, mobile platform and building it up to be more feature-complete for productivity. Meanwhile, Microsoft has been working hard to get its legacy desktop operating system to work on tablets. Apple has been building up while Microsoft is trying to scale down.*


I’m really willing to bet there’s going to be something at WWDC. I doubt full MacOS support but an iPadOS that splits even further from iOS makes sense. Or more professional-level apps that work across both desktop & iPad.

All that M1 power is just... wasted on iPadOS as it currently is.


If you had a choice, would you pick M1 iPad with MacOS over a MacBook Pro? If so, why?

I’m just trying to see why people prefer tablets over laptops, because I’m seeing if I should make the same decision.


That would be so awesome.   Real multi monitor support.  Real file system.   Real multitasking.   Please apple make IPadOS more like MacOS.    Just make it a goal that you can run Xcode on iPadOS.


[deleted]


That's a niche use-case that won't interest 99% of people.


too soon, buddy

personally, i don’t think they separated iOS and iPad OS for no reason. they might not give users MacOS on the tablet, but they’re definitely going to elevate the iPad experience to become a hybrid between the two (that being iOS and in translation iPad OS and MacOS)


I feel like the /r/apple subheader should be this phrase.


I've never owned a tablet in my life, but I agree that I would buy a macOS iPad in the blink of an eye.


[deleted]


Make the iPad Pro screen 17" and take my money


M20 iPad will come out and it still wont run MacOS...

that wont be a smart business decision for Apple.

There wont be a real reason for the Macbook to exist...


Someone should figure out how to run Boot Camp on the new iPad Pro…


Good luck with passive cooling


Exactly. I'm an engineering student. I use a Surface Book 2 as my daily driver, and I don't own an iPad - I'm broke.

I couldn't run an Apple device daily (even though I really envy that M1 chip) because I regularly use lots of software that's Windows-only.

I can still take notes with the detachable screen and build complex models in NX and SolidWorks on the same device - it's just not as "polished" as iOS or MacOS are.


No, i'd say apple's most likely reason for it is that they don't want to cannibalise their MacOS machine sales. It's also what's dictated a lot of their screen size and touch policies. For a long time they didn't do jumbo phones because they didn't want it to cut into iPad sales as that platform was still getting established, and for the same reason, they don't want Macbook buyers to end up with the cheaper iPad option, so no MacOS on iPad and no touchscreen or fully folding hinges on Macbooks. Everything Apple does is about maximizing profits per ecosystem occupant, and merging iPad / Macbook or iPad/iPhone would only cost them money.


I think they’re trying to grow the iOS/iPadOS ecosystem to the point where it’s superior to the desktop app ecosystem for many/most people. I don’t even think they mind if iPads takes sales away from Macs. I would imagine if Microsoft could figure out a way to get everyone to actually _want_ to get all their apps through he Microsoft Store, they’d be elated. However, where lots of people are starting to consider iPads as computer replacements (they can fully serve the needs of plenty of users), nobody is considering the Surface to be an anything-replacement.. It’s just another Windows laptop that can pull tablet duty in a pinch.


The design/form factor and idea of the surface pro was good but the hardware/driver issues and the user experience in tablet mode is so poor I would only use it as laptop. Not sure if I got a lemon but also ran so hot for no reason, watching a youtube vid for example. I had a maxed config surface pro too and I was shocked at the performance I got for the price. Like really microsoft? This is your top tier device? Surface pro quality control is all over the place too. Surface laptop might be decent but im staying far away from surface pros.

You are right about the software catalogue but depends on what you need. At my company we use lot of webapps and 90% macs. Only people who ask and got windows devices are accounting and finance.


Barely though, considering many apps don’t even use the larger screen. Honestly my iPad pro is just for taking written notes and watching videos now, with the occasional drawing.


But which is better as a true laptop replacement?


now we know why lol


[removed]


Because tablets don't really do anything that useful if you're not an artist, a note taker, or an avid e-reader. Aside from these things I just mentioned, you're probably better off using different devices for every other task I can think of. Why tire your arms holding an iPad for Netflix when you can have a stable laptop in your lap or cast it from your iPhone to the TV. Why type an essay on the iPad when word for Mac has more features and allows you to quickly drag and drop images instead of jumping through hoops to import from the image gallery. And does Word on iPad finally let you have two documents open at the same time or is it still one window only? Don't get me started on coding on the iPad, which step 1 is to ssh into another machine.


Oddly I use an older HP small laptop for work and the flip screen for entertainment, called “tablet mode”. This gimmicky thing we bought for our daughter is great! Best of both laptop and tablet…in 1.


You’ll have to pry my MacBook Pro from my cold, dead fingers. That being said, the Surface Laptop is a sleek device, I set up what feels like hundreds at my job. Great to see the OS as clean as possible without any OEM fluff like with Dell or HP.


If they improve battery life plus improve casual tablet experience it will absolutely obliterate iPad.


For me as a user it’s not the hardware but the operating system that drives me up the walls!

The last insane *laugh out loud* I had was, as my ThinkPad asked me for my finger ID while connected to my docking station. While collapsed/folded.


Except that outside of the US(?), they are extremely overpriced. For sure quality should add to the price, but they are like 40% more expensive than the competition with similar hardware configuration.

When compared with other "high" quality laptops, I can get a Dell XPS with better hardware for 10% less than a Surface Laptop.

And personally, I take the look of a Dell 100% of the time. Microsoft gates(pardon the pun) the black color behind expensive hardware config, and most of the time they don't release any color variations where I live.

For example the Surface Laptop Go only comes in grey regardless of hardware.

At work we can pretty much choose our laptop within a budget. Pretty much everyone has Dell XPS. Microsoft support is god awful. They say that they will get back to you, and they never do. You have to spend 3x the time to get a problem solved.


Totally agree


I like to use my iPad Pro as a second portble monitor for my Surface and it works fantastic. Looks really cool as well.


And if I'm going to take my one device, it will be the iPad.

People need to stop imaging that the work *they* do is the most important work there is, and anyone who doesn't work how they do is not really working at all. 

How often do you go to meetings where you need to show documents to other people and mark them up while sitting around a table? 

How often is the only reason you need to take something with you is to answer e-mails?

If your job consists of sitting in an office typing...yeah, you may not need an iPad. I don't use mine for that. But I don't necessarily use a laptop either; I want one or more large monitors.


I would take iPad every time,
The Netflix app doesn’t download properly on Surface, the kindle app on surface is plain bad, battery life of surface is much lower than iPad. 
The apps do not crash as much in iPad and it works well with iPhones.


Design in general? Go away…


yuuup

>	It’s hard to argue why anyone should get a Surface Pro 7 when Apple has accomplished what it has, and at a particularly low price point.

it’s actually easy, it’s a full computer. put another way, enterprise Apple users pick Macs, for the same reason. 

iPadOS though i think with M1 indicates this will all soon change. Get ready :)


I worked campus IT in college and we'd set up faculty/staff with Surfaces all the time. They usually had the docks in their office, so they would just plug in when there and do their work. We had dongles in each class that let them hook them up to the projectors too. We'd supply them with surface pens as well and they would always be using them for annotating notes and example problems.


The iPad was never meant to be a computer replacement despite them advertising it as such


I still don't know what to use an iPad for besides Netflix. I can't do anything with it.


It’s the best hardware wise. But software wise, what is it the iPad can do that surface can’t? If you’re paying a premium anyway, it’s better to go for the device with more features obviously


It’s not the best tablet if you want a tablet to run full windows desktop apps though.


problem though is the only thing i can think of that my iPad does that my Mac can’t is the Apple pencil.


The problem with this analogy is an iPad running macOS with a keyboard and pencil would be the best of everything combined into one thing. No need to pick between either a great OS or great hardware.

Now that it has the same specs as a MacBook, it’s not even compromising on power.


minivan > truck


God bless you. Totally agree


As a software developer myself, surely your work is more cumbersome on an iPad?


What are you using to code on an iPad?


Using RDP as a crutch for not being able to do anything at all windows related isn’t really a solution though. With a surface you can do all that same stuff just without having to use RDP, and can do pretty much everything else that an iPad can do.


Best thing with using a laptop over tablet? I don't have to deal with those fricking MDM software.


Why should *anyone* be downvoting the comments simply replying they’d choose the the iPad in response to this imaginary scenario? LOL. There’s no opinion here, people — objectively, no, not everyone would choose a Windows device for this made up equation, when there's no other factor presented. People would choose what they know and are familiar with.


Grandma gives you her prized family photos on a USB 2.0 for you to backup and print.

Game over


Please tell me how lol.


I’m genuinely curious what about the keyboard and mouse integration people don’t like? I have an 11” iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, and it’s become my most used device outside of work to the point I rarely bust out my MBP anymore. Even for work I’m able to do most basic tasks from it directly, and then RDP into my work machine for everything else like actual development work (and the mouse support in Remote Desktop is excellent).


I really want the magic keyboard but would basically be buying it for a convenient keyboard, so I haven't yet


I really think it will happen before, I still don't know how the whole iPad/iOS divide will happen, but Big Sur does feel quite touch ready with its huge menus and buttons, and I think it's quite obvious that it wasn't arbitrary to put M1 on the iPad.


General webpage management also sucks without hover features when using a proper mouse etc

I know this is nitpicking, but I see this phrase “light browsing” around the sub often.  What specifically does this mean?  Is there a heavier browsing that involves something an iPad couldn’t do?  The only thing that comes to mind for me is using the dev tools, which you can’t do on an iPad unless its hooked up to a Mac.


sounds nice for taking on a plane or to cafes. even though these laptops have gotten lighter and thinner, i dont want to take mine out all that much.


Thank you! I do serious work on my tablet. I also do serious work on my MacBook. It’s an entirely different kind of serious work, but both are “serious work”


It’s not just programming lol. I’m a business student and the only thing the iPad is better at for me is note taking. If I gotta open Excel or Access or something I gotta use my Surface


Good luck trying to compete with a full laptop while using an iPad.


I do serious work. I’m a designer. Wouldn’t touch a surface pro 7 if my life depended on it


Well, I can’t because safari keeps on suspending my tabs., and it’s cumbersome to multitask with


i believe you do what you consider to be serious work and i’m so jealous it works for you. for most of us though it doesn’t.


Outside of work. Its damn fantastic for playing board games on with my partner when we travel haha


Education is a unique market.  It's really the only place where I've see competition between apple and windows solutions for the same user.  Once you move into the business world, it's 95% windows with apple used in only certain roles/departments in my experience.  The apple roles will always be apple roles, the rest will always be windows.  I saw some companies try to roll out ipads as laptop replacements a few years ago but that was mostly a failure.  

So.. outside of education, and maybe the home market, I don't think there is a lot of overlap.


That’s what is known as an anecdote.


That wouldn’t honestly be the worst thing…

Most would still prefer the App Store, but apps blocked by Apple could still be installed


Oh yeah like how it canibalized App Store on macs? Oh wait, it did not


>There’s lots your iPad does that a computer/phone can’t.

Literally everything you listed can be done on a laptop/phone, how well just depends on the device itself. The ipad is inherently limited by the software no matter what.


Man, the comments here saying “The iPad doesn’t do anything BUT X or Y or Z — and I don’t do those things” are really something, huh?


Yeah it had problems but being late to the game wasn’t one of them. The author conveniently forgot all about tablet PCs.


That might be true actually.

But Android on tablets is pretty universally-agreed as a mediocre experience, so I guess the screen quality of Samsung tablets gets overlooked.


Lots of people love them though. Main critique of surfaces I hear is hardware, not software.


How are they terrible to use? People constantly defend the iPads limitations here by saying “well most users don’t need that”. It also turns out that most users are good enough with a surface, and better even, because the surface covers some basic tablet needs (like note taking, which is what I personally see people using tablets for) with a comfortable form factor, but also offer a full OS whenever needed. 

My biggest issue with the iPad is that, apart from the form factor and Apple Pencil, it really does everything worse than how a traditional laptop does it. Even web browsing has issues on iPadOS


Years ago when the first Surface was introduced, I was attracted to it, until I had the opportunity to use one.  My experience was that it was a horrible tablet and a horrible laptop.  

But that was because as a tablet, it was heavy, bulky, had short battery life, a crappy OS and poor selection of apps.  As a laptop, it was underpowered, had short battery life, poor keyboard, didn't run full Windows, etc...

I always thought that at some point technology would advance such that chips becoming faster and more efficient, many of the hardware shortcomings would go away leaving just the Windows limitations.

The iPad Pro is a great tablet.  The keyboard/trackpad options are now quite good.  The technology has advanced.  It has the same M1 Apple uses in the MacBooks, iMacs, and mini.  

Quite literally the only thing that needs to change on the iPad Pro for it to be a hybrid is for Apple provide the firmware for it to dual boot or run in a virtualized dual-mode.  Doing this subtracts nothing from it being a great iPad in any way, not battery life,  performance, weight, size, apps, etc...


You don't think Apple can do a better job?


Clearly you’re hoping for a fight. Alright, I’ll bite. What’s so bad about macOS? What makes it “the most useless OS ever” and why is it only great for monkeys?


[deleted]


Probably the same person who would but one of those hideous new Macs that have the bezels from 2001.


It is. Microsoft is a shit company


The other large part is I think it is more they want to really push on getting you to stick to applications in the App Store on iPad Pro to compensate for the very competitive pricing. Run full MacOS on it and boom you are able to go around the app store and the fee's for lots of the major applications you would want on it.

While I don't doubt there is some complications to get UX to their standards I am also quite confident if apple really wanted to they COULD get it ironed out and just actively choose NOT to.


Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't iPadOS have a new-ish trackpad support system with a mouse/pointer that works really well? Why can't that be adapted to MacOS for docked/keyboard mode and then switch to an "iPadOS-like" UI without. I mean with Big Sur and and the M1's iOS/iPadOS/MacOS have never been more similar to each other.


Apple wouldn’t even need to have a dual boot, just have it kill springboard and run WindowSever when you plug in a keyboard ans mouse. Surely they could offer an OS that would give us the best of both worlds since iOS is based on OS X


This is the opposite of Apple’s strategy. A dual booting OS is inherently complex. Apple tries to keep things simple. 

Also, I’m highly knowledgeable around technology, but I personally would hate having to use MacOS on my iPad. I have an M1 Mac Mini and a MacBook Pro, and I rarely use them. I think most consumers are like me - use a handful of apps a disproportionately high amount of the the time, but the app experience is better than the desktop experience.


I would be happy if the iPad could work as an extension of Mac. As an example, you’re working on an image in Photoshop. It’s open on the Mac and the iPad because the iPad version of Photoshop knows that it’s open on the Mac and that you are able using both computers to work on it. You are able to do all of the adjustments that you would normally do on the image in the desktop environment. Then you are able to pick up the iPad and do any adjustments that work better with a touch/stylus enabled interface i.e. burning/dodging, drawing in a mask, coloring something, etc. Then go back to the desktop to do what works better there. Back and forth until the project is complete. Basically utilizing the strengths of both platforms. This setup would no doubt utilize the power of these new iPad Pros.

Apple wouldn’t be cannibalizing the Mac market and both platforms would be better for it. iPad  doesn’t need to be a MacBook light and I don’t think that the iPad needs to be a Swiss Army knife of a computer for it to be super useful. 

That’s sort of what I see as a best case scenario going foreword. I don’t need to have MacOS on a tablet but I do need a tablet that seamlessly works with MacOS to improve the overall usability and experience of both platforms.


Is touch disabled when using Sidecar?


I just want an IPad Pro that can be used like a Wacom Cintiq tablet. Just that please for all of the illustrators that don’t want to spend money on iPad Pro and additional drawing tablet. 

Wacom price is ridiculous and I think Apple can own that market and they already do for non pro illustrators. If they can figure it out I don’t mind ditching my Wacom.


[deleted]


Give it a year or two and they’ll just merge iPad OS with macOS


Doubtful.

If your favourite app's developers haven't bothered to make an iPad app, that's their problem - not Apple's.


I imagine we will see this soon.


(Edit: Fixed my silly M1 iPad Air error).

I agree. I've owned a Surface, and it's not really a very good tablet, mostly because Windows is not a good tablet OS. Is iPadOS a good laptop OS? Certainly not...but I can still do most of what I want with it (I do own an M1 Macbook Air for the heavy-duty writing and file manipulation I need to do).

I wouldn't want MacOS on my iPad, because MacOS, like Windows, isn't a good tablet OS. It's built for mouse and keyboard, while iPadOS is built for touch (with accommodations for keyboard, and mouse support bolted on late in the game). Can Apple make a unified OS, something that will work equally well on tablet and laptop/desktop? Maybe...though I don't see Microsoft succeeding at it after a decade or more of trying. An effort like that, from MacOS/iPadOS to a theoretical AppleOS, would be equal to, if not greater than, the move from MacOS to OS X.


It sounds like Windows Mobile all over again (which had a seven-year start over iOS).


iPad os isn’t very good for productivity.


Extended monitor and windowing support please!

FCPX, Logic and Affinity Publisher double please!


I would definitely get an iPad that could run macOS because that would be one less device to deal with

I would also get a sort of keyboard/trackpad/battery dock that would connect to the smart connector too if they offered it

Should macOS be the default interface on the iPad? No… would it be amazing to have as an option with the appropriate peripherals? Most definitely

The iPad Pro costs as much if not more than a MacBook, so if Apple loses a MacBook sale to gain an iPad Pro sale, is it really a loss?


My only complaints with my m1 MacBook air are
 1) it doesn't have a touchscreen or pen support so I have to use an external writing tablet plus iOS apps are hell to use on this
2) it's slightly  too heavy and large

Using an iPad would fix these problems however it is currently too limited by it's OS.


I don't really understand the appeal of a tablet. When I'm standing up, I'll use my phablet. When I'm seated, I'll use my laptop. There doesn't seem much room for a tablet for someone with a phone and laptop already. You can draw on it and it takes up less desk space than a laptop when using it to watch NetFlix. Tablets seem kind of redundant to me.


iPads already sell four-to-ten times better than Surfaces, the amount of people who want that is really small.


I’m reminded of the iPhone 12 mini whenever people say this. The subreddit fills with posts like “I’d buy it in a heartbeat” and then when the product predictably tanks on release everyone just goes “well I *would* have bought it if only it had [insert feature]


I think docking with some limited touch support would be the way to do it. A lot of monitors from the last few years support USB-C display/charging/USB hub and obviously the Magic Keyboard is basically perfectly suited to such a role. Keyboard and mouse support is good enough on iPad OS that I don’t think you even need to have it necessarily switch to Mac OS automatically when docking. I kind of envision Mac OS on iPad being an an app that you launch like any other.


Imagine Samsung DeX but with Apple software

You connect a mouse and keyboard and have the option of using the iPad UI or jumping into the Mac UI and be able to run all the iPad apps along with those designed for a mouse and keyboard.

And then when you disconnect the keyboard, the Mac only apps suspend while the iPad apps stay “running” like multitasking in iOS currently 

It would encourage devs to make universal software more so than they already are


Form factor, which allows for more ports and thermal headroom, would be a real reason for the MacBooks to exist. Apple could easily offer Mac OS as a paid option on iPad Pro devices if they are concerned about revenue loss. That would also address concerns about making the iPad too complicated by erecting a substantial barrier to users accidentally putting their iPad into Mac OS.


how do you think 12” macbooks and the m1 macbook air are cooled?


>	I think they’re trying to grow the iOS/iPadOS ecosystem to the point where it’s superior to the desktop app ecosystem for many/most people.

I keep hearing this but I really think they’ve fixed the low hanging fruit already. The reason many of us are holding off is poor mouse UX, lack of OS control, and poor file management including lack of IO. These are all paradigm shift changes which risk making the iOS experience worse for existing users.

The solution here is to allow macOS dual-boot. Not to turn iOS into macOS.


The Surface. At least for my usage, I don't have any usage patterns that are iPhone-like-but-on-a-bigger-screen. Everything I want is either laptop or laptop-but-with-touch-and-pen. And the iPad fails at that horribly. The Surface fits that second category quite well.


Depends on what you need your laptop for.


I have both, the Surface Pro is a better if not completely satisfying laptop replacement.  The kickstand is annoying when you're trying to use it on your lap.


[deleted]


Neither. Apple sees the tablet as a complementary device, not replacement. Now you’ve bought two devices from them


None.

The goal is not to replace your laptop. The goal is to have a different tool.


But if you buy the official Apple keyboard with the iPad Pro, then you'll have a system that's heavier and bulkier than the Macbook Air/Pro. IMO the primary use of the tablet ought to be for something related to its touch capabilities, because otherwise what you have is a clunkier laptop that can't run the same apps.


I'm returning my surface because the metal kickstand is so durable and.. metal... That it digs into my skin while I use it in laptop mode while watching tv at night.  No I'm not using a cushion or putting on pants. And the angle isn't great . 

Other than that, the screen and pen have been great to use while teaching on zoom.


Ipad can't even run a version of zoom that has breakout rooms.


Neither


I'd say if you want a great laptop and tablet combo, get an iPad + an M1 Macbook air


My prediction is that soon they will unify all the apps with MacOS, but not ever full MacOS. The big key is that they will want to maintain the control and profit of an App Store; I’d be happy to take the bet that in 10 years you still won’t be able to install a .dmg or from homebrew  (unless jailbroken or antitrust suits).


People will downvote you, but you make solid points. Anyone who has used an iPad Pro professionally (especially of any typing is involved) will know it’s limitations in the business world.


I think you're missing another section, which is people who want something bigger and/or more capable than a smartphone but don't really need a laptop. I have members of my family who fall into this section and they love their iPads. 

For me personally, i also love mine while travelling when I want something bigger than my phone and don't want to lug my laptop along.


[deleted]


Absolutely. To be clear, I use a MacBook Pro as my main personal device. We are required to use either a Surface or HP device for work. Some HP devices are super nice too but Surface just hits all the high notes well for me.


That’s where Win10onARM comes into it. They just need to get their emulation as good as apples Rosetta. I’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Book 2 and the battery life is phenomenal running Win10onARM. Really excited to see ARM becoming a bigger and bigger player in computing outside of mobile.


What program are you using to set it up as a portable monitor on the surface? And just usb a to usb c cable?


Why wouldn't you just buy a $200 USB-C external monitor??


What do you do where you can do all your work on an iPad


[deleted]


>	iPadOS though i think with M1 indicates this will all soon change.

This is simply not true. The development kits had an iPad grade processor inside and still run macOS. The fact that macOS runs on the same processor doesn’t mean anything. If the M1 doesn’t heat up, Apple has no reason to invest money into a production of a separate processor. That’s a more down to earth explanation on why the iPad comes with M1: they are scaling up production to reduce costs.


yeah that sounds comfy af. imagine having that with an iPad, ability to do serious work, but off the desk you have this portability juggernaut


What's a computer?


This comment is actually next level ignorant. So many people have iPads now instead of laptops it has literally replaced millions and millions and millions of laptops


The iPad is still more-less just a bigger version of the iPhone (minus the phone)


It’s a better experience. It’s not about what it can do. It’s about how well it can do it, and what do you feel while doing it.


I’d prefer being able to put my motorcycle in the truck bed than having to also have a trailer. But you’re right, if a hypothetical grab bag of possible car tasks include driving eight people somewhere, then a minivan would be the right answer.


This.  I *can* do development on an ipad, but I'm never gonna choose to if I have the option of a real pc.  It's fine in a pinch but miserable for serious work


iPadOS needs a tiling window manager


Honestly simply having separate, overlapable windows on a single screen would be a game-changer even though I hate the iPad mouse integration.


I would recommend Textastic for an all around code support IDE but depending on the language you are using there are some specialty apps out there that are more fined tuned for them. Like play.js for doing nodejs stuff on iOS/iPadOS.


I am cranky and still stick to what I have done for decades.  SSH into my dev server then have tmux running various vi sessions, with the extra windows for   git, etc.   If I lose connection then I can pick it up again anywhere.  I am now slowly using atom/vscode on my Mac.  Tho one day I may look into the various IDEs that do run on the iPad.  If I get to that point I would mostly run AWS workspace.  One I upgrade from my 1st Gen iPad Pro to the upcoming 12.9 who knows


My work now has deployed Jamf in our macOS laptops.   At least it is better than IBM Bigfix that it is replacing.


Because his response doesn't explain why he'd pick the device with less of a chance to complete the task?

Okay so you pick the windows tablet…
Then she gives you some photos on a floppy disk, what do you do then?


Why is it game over? iPad can connect to usb storage devices, can print to any printer with AirPrint (most of them) and back up? To where? What cloud service doesn’t have a task


It is in general > keyboards in your settings. Don’t recall the exact settings. I’ll check and get back to you.


me too. me too :(


I can't fucking bookmark folders with the iSH folder directory. Who made this piece of junk file system?


I presume in this context it means brief. Someone might use a tablet to check their email or Facebook, but if they needed to research a subject and they knew it was going to take an hour or two, that's 'heavy browsing' that justifies using a computer with a mouse and keyboard.


I’d consider light browsing to be your general single tab browsing, just generally reading stuff linearly. 

The heavier browsing to me is constantly flicking between multiple tabs, copy pasting stuff between them, comparing things side by side, etc.


“Light browsing” for me means entertainment things or looking up stuff via Google or Wikipedia. 

Writing my capstone project, there were SO many websites that simply would not work on my iPad Pro, no matter the browser I installed, or with the “desktop safari” option to load webpages differently. Various institution access sites (Ebsco links, etc) simply would not work properly on the iPad, and I’d have to reach for my laptop to get everything to work right. “Heavy browsing” is when I have to load/copy/print/look at options for research databases or articles, and the iPad simply doesn’t work when I try to access them


hows the ipad for designing. does it have stuff like sketch/figma?


Which board games do you play? I was actually thinking about getting one or two.


This is the correct take.

Are you high? App Store on Mac was introduced only in snow leopard. It was never locked to App Store to begin with. And yes, most apps are now purchased from outside the store.


Yeah. 


Like honestly. The iPad is a phenomenal device. I love it. It excels at MANY things. 


Is it perfect? No. Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. 


But to say it does nothing compared to other things is just a downright lie.


I think there are a lot of unique features that make Samsung tablets good, but the OLEDs are one of the main selling points.

I loved the idea of the Surface Pro from the first gen, but it wasn't until the Surface Pro 4 that I thought it refined enough to be worth buying one. I love it but I'm definitely glad I held off as long as I did.


Honestly I just posted an innocent opinion, not looking for hate although I didnt help calling mac os users monkeys lol. Sorry guys.

The biggest thing for me really is just total control. Like I want the ability to alter any aspect of my OS, have absolute control over file systems, apps, functions etc. 

I use Windows for pretty basic things to be fair, but when I need to make program mods, I have comfort in knowing I can. 

I consider myself a casual power user, its the reason I prefer Android too. 

Mac OS is great for what it is, a hub to do basic things. Windows is its own beast.

I use Mac OS during work and it annoys me that I cant do something as simple as right click in Finder to create a new .txt file. Correct me if Im wrong lol, still getting used to it after a year of poking around.


In WHAT planet does it make sense to keep the three buttons at the top of each window SO small?

What's the point of CMD + ~ for switching windows _within_ the same application? It doesn't even move to the recent window, it just cycles through the list. As a web developer with multiple chrome windows open, this is my daily hell.

What's the point of keeping apps open after the user clicks the red X button? Why do some apps close off completely? Why don't some? Why the inconsistency? Largely why does Mac have to do things differently JUST for the sake of doing things differently?

Apple SUCKS at UI, UX and design. It makes TERRIBLE products. They are just _bad_ design and unintuitive.


...isn't the M1 MacBook Air *cheaper* than an iPad Pro 13" now?

Like, I don't entirely buy the idea that Apple is pricing these things with the idea of getting money out of you on apps later on. iPad isn't priced like a game console. Apple actually charges a premium for their hardware and software; their margins are better than anyone else in the business.


The iPad Pro costs just as much if not more than a MacBook Air though


DING DING

The entire mobile platform from the very beginning has been about resetting the idea of what a computer is and how it is used to put the platform owner in complete control. It’s been about that 30% cut from the very start.


Couldn’t Apple just put up a large barrier to normal iPad users circumventing the App Store by charging for access to Mac OS? I think it would make a ton of sense for Apple to implement Mac-on-iPad as an app, which also creates a reasonable model to charge for it. In addition to dissuading most iPad users from ever bothering with Mac mode, this would also help offset losses from potentially lower Mac sales, and maybe even generate profit if there’s a future where people are paying a fee to plug their iPad/iPhone into a screen to use as a Mac. How many people with an iPad/iPhone would pay $100 to turn it into a dockable Mac? I don’t know, but I bet it’s enough to make it an interesting conversation.


> Run full MacOS on it and boom you are able to go around the app store and the fee's for lots of the major applications you would want on it.

Unless they decide iPad macOS only gets to run signed code... *shudder*


>Run full MacOS on it and boom you are able to go around the app store and the fee's for lots of the major applications you would want on it.

It would make their entire court case with Epic pointless. They probably wouldn't protect the store so hard if what you said wasn't correct.

Dang, they'd lose a lot of money. Less people would buy a Mac and less people would buy from the iOS store.


Because Apple ultimately doesn't want you to use the iPad Pro AS a laptop.


I feel like the user experience doesn’t need to be that complex. It could be as simple as having a Mac app that you launch from the home screen and then boom you’re in Mac mode. They could even charge a reasonable fee for this Mac app to both partially offset potential future lost Mac revenue and further make this a non-default option for iPad users. 

I’d like to see this happen because I’m a pc gamer who would love to use Mac apps for hobbyist video and music production, but can’t really justify having a Mac in addition to my pc when the pc options are good too. I do love the iPad though and with the M1 it would allow me the best of both worlds without any exceedingly redundant devices.


Yeah honestly this. I'm genuinely confused on why so many people want macOS specifically on the iPad. The OS isn't set up for a touch interface AT ALL. It'd be a nightmare-ish experience.

However, there's no reason why they can't now do the opposite with allowing Mac Apps to run on the iPad, aside from rather obvious security concerns ("jailbreaking" the device to potentially run other OS's would become a lot easier if such a thing happened)

you can do that with sidecar, and there are also physical dongles but I don't know if they're any better these days.

but yeah. the only real macos app I use these days, outside of terminal, is photoshop. which involves a lot of masking. I hate regular tablets. I just want to be able to do that shit on my ipad. but I still want my same cameraraw workflow…


sidecar, no?


Agreed. Multitasking on the iPad is terrible. It’s not intuitive or natural like a desktop OS. Half the time I forget how to even open two things at once.


Same here. You can’t even open the same app twice unless the app supports it.


Add external monitors to that list.


Agreed window management would be nice.

Just need to make sure there’s capacity for app devs to beef up that UI code. Seems like a lot of these apps (like Apollo for instance I’m on it rn) have very fixed layouts, and elements of the UX seem like they’ve been created to *feel* good in maybe like six aspect ratios?

Idk just crazy how advances in software just end up creating more work. I’m also currently a little bit high.


I’d guess they’ll just keep improving iPadOS until it’s largely better than MacOS to the point where you won’t be tempted to want MacOS on your iPad. Everyone clamoring for MacOS isn’t doing it for love of MacOS, they’re doing it because they want the iPad to be able to run any kind of app; to run apps that don’t need to go through the App Store. If Apple did release MacOS for the iPad but locked it down as tight as current-iPadOS (store-only apps; no Xcode).. little would be gained.

There’s little point in bringing MacOS—the Operating System—to the tablet world. The other issues (app availability/open-ness)...I’m curious to see how it’s going to go down.


I don’t think so.   What makes something a good iPad app is different from what makes it a good Mac app or a good iPhone app.   Now that I think of it, first class iPad apps may replace their Mac equivalents before the reverse happens.


What can I make you eat when they don’t?


>	Can Apple make a unified OS, something that will work equally well on tablet and laptop/desktop? 

I’d say Apple is best equipped now to make the best version of something like Windows Continuum/Samsung Dex. Use iPadOS in tablet mode, but switch to macOS in tablet mode.

Now that both share the same processor even, this shouldn’t be that hard to pull off, though the space consumption might increase quite a bit.


No it isn't. Windows Mobile was the attempt to create a iOS competitor with a Windows flavor. That OS wasn't a scaled down Windows but a new mobile operating system attempting to look like the desktop's


Well, it really depends how you define that productivity. I use iPad Pro for sketching and image editing mostly and I would say it fits my needs better that any other device on the market. In fact it works better than Wacom tablet connected to my workstation.
Would I use iPad as my daily computer for text editing? Most likely not.


It is for appropriate tasks. Go onto Apple’s website and have a look at their various business case studies, you’ll find some good examples of productivity improvements using i devices.


iPad pros or just iPads in general?


[removed]


Pro users are a loud, vocal, irrelevant niche.

A forum of 1,000 pro users moaning about a missing feature is a drop in the ocean compared to the vast swathes of ordinary consumers.


My girlfriend would have gotten the 12 mini, but her 6 broke in the summer of 2020 and only the 11 was available at the time.  She hates how big the 11 is, but she won't be buying a new phone for another 6 years if we go by her current phone replacement schedule lol.


Same, I have a surface pro as basically a small laptop that can be a tablet for some things.  If I got an iPad, I'd feel like I'd also have to bring a laptop around to do the things an iPad can't do.  Sure, the Surface Pro is a worse tablet than an iPad, but it does everything I want a tablet to be able to do while also being a full laptop.


Fair. The iPad pro is more flexible for notetaking, so it's the one I would a actually choose. But for more specialized, PCish stuff, there's no good alternative to the surface. Actually the keyboard on the surface is miles better so for typing up something long, I'd choose that as well.


Need to be productive? Surface. Want to be discovered by Apple by doing contrived shit for marketing material? iPad Pro.


Are you just ignoring the files app?  It isn’t the greatest, but definitely provides file management.


Have you tried? The files app mostly covers it for me. Obviously that requires you to store things in icloud


But at the same time they’re giving the “complementary” device the same specs as the primary.

It just doesn’t make sense, especially when even the previous iPad Pro wasn’t being used to its full potential

You could say previously that the iPad was too slow to do extremely complex tasks, but now it’s the exact same hardware in a different form factor


That's why the surface is great. It works pretty well as a laptop, and it's actually not a shitty tablet if you actually use it.


How weak are your legs? Seriously lol. They weigh like 1kg.


[deleted]


I'd get the iPad and a windows device that's more powerful but less portable than the redundant m1 mba


Or a Surface pro for what, half the cost? And it'll be around 75-85% the quality


They need a good ARM processor first, and they probably won't get that from Qualcomm. They need to design their own chip or get someone to make a good design for them because the SQ chips just aren't cutting it.


Surfaces are good because they run any app in existence basically. Windows on arm is hardly better than ipadOS as I see it In this regard.


Program is called Duet. 

USB A-C works, I use a sweet little short and flat USB C-C cable when I go wired but it works well wirelessly also. I’ve even ran full screen video on the ipad screen but playing from the Surface and it worked far better than I expected. Not perfect but good enough to watch if I left the cable home, heh. I usually go wired though, it is just so simple.


Watches Netflix


Illustration for instance. Thats where the iPad is superior.


Depends on what we see in iPadOS 15. 

It gets major jumps every other year, as it did with 11 and 13.


If you do video editing on the iPad Pro, having the ability to play more simultaneous streams or to export faster is something that comes to mind. 

We really need Xcode, Final Cut and Logic for the iPad though. All those apps would benefit from the M1.


I would say the first criteria is being able to run anything on it, not just software from the App Store and _only_ the App Store.


Yes, and so have Chromebooks.

What I mean is Apple doesn't even allow it to even have feature parity with its computers.  It's a device intended to complement a computer, not replace it.

But yet they keep upgrading the specs and now the iPad Pro has the exact same internals as their laptops and desktops


[deleted]


Yep. Windows 10 and touch is a hit or miss experience. So if most of what you're doing is some basic word processing and note taking, I'd go to the iPad. If you need anything else though, the Surface is probably the better choice


I wish we could do serious work on it though


Totally agree


That’s kind of cheating…

I would love to be able to run Xcode on an iPad and write software right then and there without having to depend on a remote system


https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-hook-my-iPad-Pro-to-printer-using-USB-cable

You'd need the printer to be airprint compatible if you want it to print. You can't connec the iPad to a printer via USB cable. So USB-C dongle won't be to the rescue.


Your scenario is significantly less likely than the USB. Considering floppy disks haven’t been sold in over 15 years and most likely every single one of them don’t work anymore.


I’ll take a look. Cheers legend.


Interesting take.  Looking at market share, especially in the business sector, there must be an awful lot of "old school businesses" lol


Don't forget DeX


The new Swiftkey based keyboard on win10 is great now


Microsoft has done a surprisingly good job in recent updates (especially upcoming Insider updates) with optimizing the tablet UX in Windows. It's still nowhere near as fluid as iPadOS, but it's getting better.


What are you unable to control on a Mac that you need so bad? As a power user you are probably very familiar with bash.


I use windows for a gaming pc and work. I haven’t used a Mac until this month. 


I’m the opposite. I’ve never needed to create a txt file in finder. Didn’t even know you could in windows. 

But after using Mac for even a little bit, I find myself hitting alt + space on my windows machine CONSTANTLY and being frustrated I can’t bring up Alfred/spotlight to just search for what I want


I use Windows for work and good lord I wish my complaints were as simple as the three windows buttons.


In Canada, the iPad pro is cheaper.. but once you buy the keyboard and pen, it's as expensive if not more than the MB pro 13


I’m fairly certain Apple is profiting the entire time. Especially when they get people in their hardware ecosystem. Buy an M1 MBA? Better get an iPhone. Better get an iPad Air for sidecar, ooo a watch too? 

It’s entirely possible they make money selling hardware right from the get-go and from software too. Those things don’t have to be exclusive.


Well the MacBook Air is also cheaper than the MacBook Pro - and there is absolutely no difference between the two machines. 

Well apart from everything outside the SOC.

The thing with the iPad Pro 13” is that it has a better display than the MacBook Pro, and more importantly it also has a touch display, and of course the Pencil support. And it is cheaper than the MacBook Pro, because it doesn’t have one of these really expensive keyboards - oh, yeah, it also doesn’t run macOS apps.

I post this fully expecting I will be downvoted again, because certain people don’t like facts. But let’s face it, if Apple let the iPad Pro run random Mac software, pretty much everyone who bought an M1 Mac would be rightfully pissed.


[deleted]


Yes, when jobs introduced the very first iPhone without an App Store and not wanting an appstore on the iPhone, he was simply looking for a way to get the 30% cut from the App Store. Companies are shit, but ya'll need to stop being so freaking paranoid and trying to find a conspiracy in everything.


I’d pay $100 to use it as a real computer


Here’s the thing with Apple that I’ve noticed: they don’t care about the price. People will buy it, and it’s a damn good product. If Apple allowed MacOS on iPad, even without touch, how much revenue would be lost from folks who currently need to use both, and as such buy both?

There are some tremendous apps for iPad, but if you introduce boot camp with macOS on an iPad, there go your MacBook Pro sales (since the chip is the same). Can there be other differentiators? Sure, but that would be a direct impact and Tim Cook would be looking for a new CEO position


Ehhh. That wouldn't *awful*, but definitely not the preferred route.


[deleted]


Yep, even though they are constantly trying to push it as a laptop replacement, the OS and available apps are just too limited in functionality.


Boom you’re in a mode that you can no longer use the primary input method for.

The big draw is for people who have important Mac apps (especially apps important for work) that don't work on an iPad. If you're a developer, a big one is Visual Studio Code. But another one is browser debuggers in general - the only way to debug Safari on iPad is to [plug the iPad into a Mac](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/ios-debugging/).

The Magic Keyboard already exists which gives the iPad a keyboard and trackpad. That eliminates any nightmarish experience. So then the big draw is to be able to have one device that can do everything, instead of needing to switch between iPad and laptop.


Allowing mac os apps on the iPad wouldn't solve all the limitations from iPad OS.  
For instance multitasking on an iPad is still terrible, and is only a gadget more than a feature that can be used efficiently in any workflow.   
You can't plug it to an external monitor to use it fully.    
People want Mac os on the iPad pro because as it is today the iPad pro is way too limited by its OS. It's called a pro device but you can't get any pro workflow on this device except on some very specific cases, using workarounds that are time wasting and consuming.  
If you wanna sell it as a pro device, as something that will one day replace the classic PC experience, then they have to ship it with a full fledge OS.  
  
About Mac OS not being a good touch experience... Apple can still work on a touch interface that they can add to Mac os to make it better.


Because the form factor of the iPad plus MK is better but iPadOS blows.


That is definitely the gameplan considering that most iOS games and apps are compatible with M1 Macs, by putting M1 on the iPad Apple is signaling to developers pro and indie make all your apps compatible to iOS/iPadOS or you'll be left behind by people that are hungry to make desktop class applications on the AppStore. We finally have an iOS device that supports 8-16gb of ram, give it some time and the applications will follow.


The best of both worlds = compromise. No need.


It doesn’t work as smoothly as a Wacom tablet it lags and it doesn’t run smooth. I want to love side car but no it doesn’t work reallly.


Not to mention the number of apps that still don't support split screen/slide over/whatever those things are called. When it works it works, but it's just clunky AF.

If you add external monitors to an iPad it’s no longer an iPad.


Until you can run Xcode on an iPad people will want to be able to run Mac on it

The M1 is a waste on the iPad Pro as things stand


This. Yes exactly. This is vision vs. FUD / change resistance.


This is very likely, actually. Mac needs software, not the other way around.


*I think you meant desktop mode

Also, while I see iPads gaining a desktop mode with extended windowing and monitor support, and maybe with universal Mac/iPad apps, I don’t see iPadOS becoming open like macOS with things like sideloading, sudo, or file sharing and hosting.

I would honestly be fine with that alone. That’s how I used my Mac for years and it can push my iPad from a “most of the time computer” to an “all the time computer”

The main problem IMO isn’t with iPadOS, or with sufficient hardware performance, or even with the limitations of iPad apps. It’s that a lot of critical software is written for PCs.

And not “macs are PCs too” PCs, or “windows on ARM” PCs, or “Linux workstation” PCs, or “convertible slim laptop in a Manila folder” PCs.

X86, big-dumb-tower, with discrete graphics and fans and all, running non-virtualized, full-privilege 64bit Win10.


Sure it is. I had an HTC MDA phone in 2005 that ran Win Mobile 5. It was pretty clunky and very old school Windows-y. iOS didn't come out until 2007.

You're probably thinking of Windows Phone, introduced in 2010 as "Windows Phone 7" to unify it with Win7.


All iPads.

However Microsoft doesn’t release a breakdown of Surface sales.


I'm saying this sub sucks at designing products


I have an iPad Pro and a SP7 that I use for work. The SP7 is just so much better for productivity. I fight iOS apps a lot. Many professional apps for healthcare are buggy and slow but often are worse on mobile. Typing EHR notes on an iPad is really bad. Using the iPad to run patient education software is where it excels. It’s a fantastic media device. The the rest is meh.  My SP7 does 90% of the heavy lifting now. 

Side note, my iPad Pro is my favorite device to travel on a plane with. The SP7 is kind of awkward in small airline seats due to kickstand falling off the back of the table.

Totally not a biased take.


Dude, miss me with that bullshit. It will manage files in the same way the Pinto could be a car. Yeah, it technically does the job. It also explodes.

That's about the equivalent of actually using the Files app. Files can barely manage to send an item to a SMB share, it comes short on the barest minimum requirements, much less on the basic UX needed to actually manage and move files and folders. Terrible UX, shaky grasp of very basic functions. Files is horrible.


File management on ipad technically exists, but it's god awful experience.


I’ve never actually tried doing it on my iPad but I feel like if I had a bunch of files, I’d still rather have a few Finder windows open on a laptop and drag things around between folders


I’ve never understood the “there’s no file management!” Argument against iPads and iPhones. What exactly are you doing on a phone or tablet where you supposedly *need* to be able to access system files? I switched to an iPhone with the 11 pro, hadn’t had one since the 3GS, and have never gone “oh no I really wish I could go 8 folders deep into sys/users/drivers/etc and so forth. Have never had a problem with saving and opening files.


It’s cheaper for Apple to consolidate chip lines. They’re inviting these criticisms with this action. Hopefully consumers place enough pressure on them to one day provide macOS on iPads.


> But at the same time they’re giving the “complementary” device the same specs as the primary.

So ? The specs don't define what a product is. Ford will sell you a pick-up truck or a sedan with the same engine. That doesn't make the sedan a pick-up.

They are just different devices, with different uses. Apple wants to make the best possible tablet, so they put their best SoC in it. 

> You could say previously that the iPad was too slow to do extremely complex tasks, but now it’s the exact same hardware in a different form factor

But it's the form factor that matters. The iPad Pro always was very powerful. Can the OS be improved ? Sure. And they will improve it. That's why iPad OS was split from iOS. But it will always be a tablet, not a laptop. Don't expect it to be a a laptop.


It’s a shitty tablet and a shitty laptop.


People do that with desktops and laptops. They serve different functions.


Its really hard to find a laptop that is in the same category in the MBA but doesn't have the floor wiped in terms of performance and battery life. The base MBA is a great deal and I'd suggest it over any windows ultrabook


Yeh someone else needs to step up. Hopefully Samsung + AMD can start hitting some home runs and supply chips for MS.


Win10onARM has 32bit emulation, with x64 in preview right now I believe. If they can get that emulation as good as apples is, all they then need is the SOCs to improve.

Windows10onARM is their future I believe.


Yes, I agree. This is one of the few cases

Tho it is pretty amazing for drawing and stuff for if you can afford the pencil


I just RDP to a real computer most the time lol


Yeah, but we are talking about grandma here. Hell, she probably has a slide deck she needs you to scan too.

The usb hardware for both are likely going to work with Windows and possibly Mac OS too. I'm not sure about iPad OS


I have plenty of disks that work just fine actually 

I even have a USB floppy drive for those times I come across some disks

It’s very weird to see a floppy disk mount in macOS…


It is amazing how many years it took them to do that after buying out SwiftKey.


Lol I do that too. Takes me a few mins to get out of each OS habits. I use Windows personally and Mac outside, and I find Mac OS shortcuts seem to take over my brain. Its prob just me being more focussed on trying to remember them, since the OS is more new to me. Been using Windows since literally grade 4 when those awesome library PC games were a thing.


..press the windows key?? 🤷🏻‍♂️


Canadian pricing -

iPad Pro 12.9" 256GB $1529 ($1409 education)

MacBook Air 13.3" 256GB $1299 ($1169 education)

Difference - $230 regular, $240 education

Add Apple Pencil $159 and MKB $419, now iPad Pro 12.9" 256GB will cost $2009, $710 more than MBA. That money can buy you MBA with 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM or MBA + PS5 or AirPods Max.

In Canada, tax is insane in some provinces which will make these pricing differences even more bigger after taxes.


Not exactly, no

But with the proper peripherals, you could use an iPad Pro as a Mac if Apple would just allow it in software


When he introduced the iPhone in 2007, Steve Jobs initially didn’t want an App Store. What he wanted were web apps. He had to be convinced by his senior leadership team to change his mind.


I’m pretty sure he really was against the App Store, I think the biography mentions it?


Hrmmmm I don’t necessarily agree with this. MacBook Pro gets you significantly more storage, a beautiful keyboard, a huge top quality trackpad, completely different center of gravity during use (bottom heavy background top heavy wins every day in every way). The price between the two is purchasing separate things. Apple has always been about cannibalizing their own products before somebody else does.


People who wouldn’t buy an iPad Pro at all would now be interested in one, and at a price tag higher than a MacBook Air is it really a loss for Apple in that situation?


Boom I know but I am fine with it


I’d never considered this idea, but I love it. Especially with an external monitor. My MBP is in clamshell mode 99% of the time, no reason an iPad Pro couldn’t do the same thing.


There’s no need to do this if you subscribe to Apple’s idea of seamless continuity between devices.


I’d argue iPadOS is good for typical iPad things (mobile games, web browsing, streaming video, social media etc) but it’s certainly not enough to replace a full fledged desktop OS.


I do wonder how Apple can force devs to actually write proper full-featured apps for iPadOS instead of fatter phone apps


I agree I want Xcode on it. I wouldn’t complain if I had to launch it from iPadOS, though. There’s nothing particularly special about MacOS itself that I think would be awesome on an iPad. I don’t think they’d ship it with system-level root access anyway. That’d be too big a gift to hackers.


Yes, that was what I was thinking of.


I wonder how many of those are iPad Pros, I’d assume that the iPads that sell the most is the iPad base model and the iPad Air. Not sure where the iPad Mini would be though.


I have both (iPad Pro 2018 and Surface Pro 6) and tbh they’re the same to me. For both I bought a matte screen protector to make writing easier. I find I don’t use my iPad that much compared to my Surface just because of how versatile the Surface is, my iPad is kinda limited to really good apps like Procreate.

Just crossing my fingers for running macOS apps on iPad so I can use apps like App Store Connect or Xcode to compile and upload apps to the App Store.


Hard disagree on this. It’s a lame tablet, decent laptop, and great art tool that fits enough niche uses to be a good package for many professionals. It’s great in the healthcare realm.


I mean, it doesn't run some shitty mobile OS, so I can almost see the argument for being a shitty tablet...


I used a Surface Pro all through engineering school, and the ability to take notes with the pen in class, then switch o MATLAB/Excel/SolidWorks to get assignments done was phenomenal. It has the two features I needed out of a tablet: portability and ease of note taking. It also has the key feature of a laptop: the ability to run desktop programs, i.e. MATLAB and SolidWorks. I personally would say it's a pretty great laptop and an okay tablet.


Disagree. It's decent at both

The mba is amazing in some use cases , but simply lacks the flexibility the the wide range of windows designs available provide. And if you have an iPad pro for basic needs, I'd get a bulkier laptop with a dgpu that would wipe the floor with the m1 in terms of powers as my endurance need would be handled by the iPad.


I honestly don't think anyone can get close at the moment. And I've never owned an apple product before (price and I use Windows/android for everything) but I can't see anyone catching them on arm in the next 2-3 years.

Samsung maybe, their latest chips get close to Snapdragon, and they've linked up with AMD for GPUs. But I don't think they'll make anything that'll match the M1 anytime soon, let alone the M2 or whatever


I mean software capabilities. Not ram.


Which proves my point entirely haha


Actually unsure if a USB for that purpose will work on the iPad, to be honest. I might just test that now. I have a dock for my Pro.


Windows has had it for at least 2 years. The original one the came when win10 shipped in 2015 was trash, but they fixed it a while ago.


Spotlight is WAAAAAAAY more powerful. For example, one thing I do all the time is type the name of a contact and start texting. I can't even have Windows search find a simple folder! Or calendar events, or preview a whole host of different file types like PDFs, audio files, etc without having to actually open them, or search through things like emails, etc etc. Windows is also terrible with natural language, for example if I type "photos from last week" on Spotlight then it will bring all the photos I took from last week, in Windows Search it does a Bing search. One I just used today was "documents I created a month ago" and it worked perfectly. Spotlight is just much smarter in general, for example I can search using initials - if I want to find "Logic Pro" then I can just type "LP", or it's much better at finding things that I can't quite remember the name of, like I only remember a part of a name or initials or something.


If you think the windows key is anywhere close to the power of spotlight and Alfred, I feel bad for you


In Nova Scotia, that’s another $300 extra just in tax, lovely

Yeah those words came out of his mouth, how great web apps were on the iPhone and all... But I always saw that as a bullshit excuse for not having an App Store on day one.

You can get 2 TB on the iPad Pro. Pretty sure that's also the max on the MacBook Pro. And then the iPad has touch input, a vastly superior camera, and the ability to use it as a tablet only, portrait or landscape mode, or kbd/trackpad.


That’s the main catch nobody seems to notice! iPad Pro 12.9 and MacBook Air may have approximately the same display size and the M1, but it’s still an overall smaller device, with a much, much smaller battery. It wouldn’t even start to make the MacBooks useless and less bought, but it may shift users that never bought an iPad towards that option, because if you can only buy one, due to your budget, you will go for whichever fits your needs most. 

If that’s an iPad, and you’re on a budget, you’ll be more likely to choose a cheaper base or Air model. But if the iPad Pro had access to __MacOS-like features and MacOS Apps__ (it doesn’t even have to run the full OS) then some people may be willing to pay the extra to get a combination device, such as the iPad Pro’s within this scenario.

Now, if you want a laptop, for a laptop experience, and a laptop sized battery, and a laptop number of ports, you will never, ever, buy an iPad to use it as a laptop.


You aren’t the target market.


By the way, keeping an iPad or MacBook plugged in all the time is terrible for the battery. Please don’t do it. It shouldn’t be sitting at 100% all the time. I damaged my MBP battery that way.


Yeah, it’s fine for what it is, but the problem is Apple are selling the keyboard and advertising it like an actual computer. And while I still love my iPad Pro and do most of my photo and video editing on there, it’s very easy to run hard into the limitations of the OS that don’t need to be there.


Make me jump through hoops and call it developer mode if you want. But it’s decent multi-tasking and a little flexibility on running your own code away from being a much better device.


Looking at you Instagram


I am glad it worked for you, I have a couple surfaces floating around and I find them clunky to say the least.


Decent is not great..


Eh, a $1000 windows laptop will still be incredibly good and will have far more ability than a M1 MacBook. Desktops are cheaper than laptops so a $1000 desktop will be amazing if you aren’t getting a huge GPU.


Well if you got a base model iPad and an MBA, that is still a very compact package overall with a lot of performance. You could get more powerful computers, but not without significant tradeoffs in size, weight, and battery life.


I’d love to know why and how Apple can continually makes best in market SOCs that no one else can match. Is it just that they literally have the best chip designers in the world? Is it that they spend more money on it? Is it patents that prevent others from doing what they do?

Intel must be quietly shitting themselves tbh. First AMD steals their lunch money and not Apple have come along and broken up with them and told them “it’s you, not me”.


What do you think they can offer?

No really... what can they offer that will be compatible with the phones, but also utilize 16gb of ram?

The wishlist for ipadOS is like... better file management. Better multitasking. Better notifications. 

These things don't need a M1.


Interesting read

https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/27/scott-forstall-deposition-apple-v-epic-case/


How?


The app that I use for my living is only available on iPads. Unless there is a mac with detachable keyboard and can run in portrait mode, I am stuck with an iPad. Since there are already so many threads discussing about this topic, I am sure that both our opinions might not be the minority.


Thank you for the reminder! Luckily MacOS 10.15.5 has some built in features to help with this, so your battery doesn’t go above 80%. I wish they had this years ago!


Apple has recently introduced software limiters for Macs that recognize when a device is plugged in all the time. Basically limits the charge to 80% which is fine. 

I think Apple does something similar with iPads now. But whatever, if the battery goes bad its a $100 replacement. Not cheap, but also cheap enough not to worry about when i’m charging my iPad.


But it's far from shitty


Paid $1150 for mine. 4900HS, 2060 MaxQ, 1TB storage, 16GB memory, 14" screen, 3.6lb, 0.7" thick. There are definitely compelling options on both sides at that price point.


The point of getting a powerful iPad pro is that is has everything is want from the MacBook air, making it redundant. Then you can get a device that can do what the MacBook air can't do, as you don't need to care about size and weight as much if the iPad pro covers that.


I don’t know what text editors you’re thinking of… but Luma fusion. Photoshop. Affinity. Pixelmator. All of them utilize the maximum of what they’re allotted. Add in Final Cut, Logic Pro, and Xcode and you’re practically underpowered. 

They don’t need to be compatible with the phones. iPadOS only. 

Also there’s no 2TB M1 with 8, so they used what they had.


Re-read that comment you first replied to in a sarcastic voice.


that depends on who you are asking.


Well I am saying that if you want the option to do desktop grade work and a great tablet experience, a base iPad and a MacBook air is a good way to get both


Who is coding on an ipad?

The thing barely has a file manager ffs. 

This is jamming in software to try an utilize hardware because there is no other way to justify new ipad pros. 

"Look ma, I can batch process photos in full photoshop on my phone in record time!"

... but *why* would you do that?  Who is out there using a tablet for serious photoshop work?  Who is using a tablet to code?

Wouldn't they be better served by a laptop?  Do they really need the ability to detach the screen and watch netflix on it?

You are talking about a niche of a niche group that is probably better served by another device anyway.


If this was a surface I could kinda understand... that is 80% of a laptop anyway.  The ipad is like 10% of a laptop.


I look forward to things being made in Taiwan

Add:I meant this in a sincere and positive way.


This will give companys another opportunity to decouple the worlds economy so with china to some extent. Between the human rights abuses, work conditions and intellectual property theft its just not worth it. The world can eagerly wait for china to clean house and raise its standards to the international level.


The reason Apple is in China isn’t just labor cost. An analysis done on manufacturing cost, if you moved it to let’s say the us, you would pay $110-270 more per iPhone. Not insignificant but not impossible either.  What was the bigger driver was in the early days of iPhone, China manufactures were willing to bend backwards to land the Apple contract. There are tales of literally woke factories up for Apple exec to tour, creating new process and parts, and changing design and parts on the fly(famous story of Steve Jobs discovering that keys can scratch iPhone screen so it had to be glass, new major design change a month before manufacturing). How interconnected the supply chain was, like if you need a new screw, the guy that builds them is down the street, made iPhone happen. Now that product is matured and standardized, with robotic manufacturing assisting, less need to stay in China.

Anyone else remember how Apple was unable to move production out of China to support the Uyghur's because it would be impossible? Ya that was a fun lie.


Lol change this to “Foxconn shifting production from one of its factories to another.”  Foxconn’s super global, so if it’s not China, they got Vietnam, Mexico, etc etc to shift their production around. Whether Apple had qualified these sites is another matter...


I think apple (and a lot of companies) have been thinking about moving production from China to SE asia for a while now, tradewar and coronavirus were just the things that are giving the final push to actually do it. The difficulty in moving away from China is losing the robust supply chain


It’s not a bug. It’s a feature.


But they said that their products were safe against viruses!


This to me, seems like a scapegoat for Apple to continue moving production out of China. Over the years, it's been noted that Apple has been overreliant in China for manufacturing and they'd like to move. IIRC India was the most recent place they dumped a hefty sum. Coronavirus though a hot topic, isn't serious enough of a virus to warrant a massive push to relocate. Apple has never cared about Influenza, but I will tell you right now it is *far* more deadly, infectious, and mutates more rapidly than Coronavirus. But because it's such a hot topic, this gives Apple the reason it needs to move locations, without suffering a backlash


Definitely nothing to do with a 26% import Trump tariff. Nothing at all.


Why is it always only about Apple? For example, my favorite store for microcontrollers is empty as well. ~~This~~ The situation is way bigger than only Apple.


And people said Macs couldn't get viruses...


Oh oh. Tim’s going to lose his Friend of China status over that.


So what other low wage country will they use ?

? America?


Winnie will be angry.


Good start.. Now we just need it back to the US. Medical production should be top priority though.


Damaging, but not a bad idea. Edit: Hopefully, things turn out alright.


They’ll make us pay for the move


Will this actually, substantially affect anything?


That's strange. Only 76,204 have this big nothing-burger of a virus and yet it's affecting so much production. /s


So what new country will they exploit?


I would definitely like to buy a MADE IN USA iPad with higher price.

These iPad doesn’t break easily anyway my IPAD 4 is still kicking.


This silver lining to this virus is that it's  doing a lot of good dismantling China's power piece by piece. What with the demands for freedom of speech and moving manufacturing etc.


I don't care if we have to pay a little more, we need to stop outsourcing and keep jobs in the USA. We need to get out of this cheepskate mentality that only causes terrible working conditions and child labor.


Bull shit. Apple just moved because labor in India costs even less. Corona virus just a convenient excuse that sounds better than "Indian slaves are cheaper"


Be epic if all the factories were moved out of china.


Introducing the iCovid 19!


Just a flu huh


I gotta say, Corona Virus has done wonders for the potential future of US Production

Employees killing themselves... install nets.  Not one employee is dead from coronaviris, nope the fuck out of there.


Apple's products are their own disease.

Yeah ok whatever. I love sweet little lies


How will they keep their incredibly massive margins now?

They'll have to double the price of their iPads!


Viva la Mexico!


Move everything out. They are not a very nice nation.

GOOD. Should have been like that anyway


This is good. We should move all our production out of China and to a genuine ally.  China is dangerous, and we should treat them as such...


Just imagine the backlash on internet:
“No headphone jack but it includes coronavirus? Switching to google now”


Price set to triple.


Sounds to me like they're using this as an excuse to move production out of China ( not a bad thing ). Rate of infections are gong down in the mainland outside of Wuhan, and businesses have started working again as of yesterday... so yeah. I don't think this is due to the coronavirus, but more due to wanting to move production in the first place.


I wish it didn't take a world health crisis to convince companies China is a bad idea.


Been waiting for the stupid pro to be in stock for like a month now. (Through spectrum)


Discounting loss of life this is a net win from an ethical perspective


I think this more a case of Guō Táimíng moving his Hon Hai  operation to TW  to help his presidential bid in 2024. Apple doesn't really have much say in where he decides to locate his operations.


The more business and production we move out of China, the more all the better off everyone will be when we cut ties with them

iPads are still a thing?


MexIphones?


Hahahahahhahahahahha

Fuck Apple.


Great pack those iPads with the virus and ship them off to the U.S.. The ones already packaged are probably on their way.


Oh now you move out of China


Oh, good.

The children in China finally get a break. South Korea may want to keep an eye on their young ones now.


Huh, so Foxconn hanging up anti suicide next doesn't do it, but a flu with (so far) relatively  very few casualties makes them run for it...


iMMunity


Since when do you just up and move a huge production manufacturing facility like iPad? Unless they’re already making iPads in another country, It’s not something you just go set up shop with at a moments notice. I think that’s a huge undertaking.


Large corporations that don't plan for contingencies are full of shit.


I hope they will return back to the American garage where they allegedly started and stop littering the environment with the waste of their ingenious inventions :)


Also a convenient excuses as it relates to trade disputes...


Why tho? The Chinese gouv. keep saying everything is under control, look at the number they released, nothing worth panicking right.


What does that mean for employees


fuck apple!


Why do you think Trump is visiting India? Foxxcon at Chennai and Bengaluru along with Taiwan's Winstron

Fitting username


Is this the fall of china?


This, I believe, is a wake up call for global markets. If this coronavirus continues to spread and shut down countries the shutdown of production lines will be the last things people will be worrying about...


God forbid they move it into the U.S. or maybe even start paying taxes. IPhones are based on 5 YEAR OLD SAMSUNG'S. Just wanted everyone to know. 😁


Realtalk:  Are iPads potential viral carriers?


The oppressive human rights policies have nothing to do with it. Profit over people.


They should be moving some hi/tech medical labs INTO China.  Put some of that money back into helping the people that have been creating their products.


I shocked people still buy iPhones/iPads when Samsung exists at a far lower price. I've owned several and never had any problems.


Haha no chance of made in USA


Taiwan number one


I have no problem with stuff being made outside of the US; I have a problem with us shipping off manufacturing and IP to our main geopolitical rival. 

Taiwan makes good stuff.


Or india


Honestly ya. It's going to be made in a cheap labor country, at least make it in one that isn't (any more, they used to be) authoritarian and a threat to everyone on the world stage.


Taiwan No. 1!


They need to move everything back to the United States and produce jobs here and deal with paying everyone a couple extra bucks. The damn iPhone 11 only cost them $181 in parts and a little over $400 after everything out the door. I'd say they have some wiggle room wouldn't you?


Again!


Oh, you mean the Republic of China?


As long as production is decentralised and not solely in the PRC, I am happy. I do not like the CCP due to how they treat their citizens, and therefore do not want to indirectly give money to them through taxes, but the Taiwanese government is fine, as far as I know.


For me, I hope they also include the Philippines. We do lots of final product assembly here, but rarely manufacturing.


I would argue that more and more things will be made in Vietnam. Many big brands are shifting to Vietnam such as Samsung and Sony.


[deleted]


Africa is the new China.


taiwan numba 1!!


The economy needs the boost.


For real, if Apple moves their iPhone production out of China I may seriously consider buying another one


Too pricey, it moved from Taiwan to China. More likely it’ll move to Vietnam.  Samsung already has factories there.


You spelled Vietnam a funny way


Redditors believe it would be better to make Apple stuff in Taiwan, because Foxconn so bad right? Foxconn is a Taiwanese company and their CEO is pro Beijing who ran for government in the last elections. But in Taiwan is still better right ?


Taiwan makes quality stuff. I also like supporting the rebels though too...


Production ramped up in india facility, though it needs china s raw materials as stocks won't last long


The IP is definitely a concern for apple, but more than anything this is about the rising cost of labor in China and the increasing ability to automate all of production. If Taiwanese labor is slightly more expensive but the next manufacturing line can be more automated, they can reduce the cost to manufacture while avoiding the risks of manufacturing in China.

Now they don't have to be as concerned with appeasing the Chinese government and they can avoid expensive tariffs or embargoes which may increase as the Chinese government comes into more conflict with western countries. Of course this doesn't actually stop IP theft given the scale of Chinese corporate espionage, but it helps. 

If apple thought that they could lower costs in China more, they would gladly keep looking the other way on the human rights abuses and the work conditions.


Or they move to a country that is worse.


China's power doesn't just come from being the world's factory, but mainly from being one of the biggest consumer markets in the world. If your countries' companies lose access to that market, that will hurt the economy enormously.

Apple makes almost as much money in China as they do in Europe and Volkswagen has higher revenues in Asia than the Americas.


Surely a bunch of corporations moving out of China will cause them to commit LESS human rights abuses!  I mean with less money in their economy China will totally just say fuck it and start being nice and not, you know, purge again.  Also surely a company like Apple that makes more money than Vietnam will ever have period won't have undue influence in these smaller nations to enable gross corporate human rights abuses, right?  
  
At least with China you found out about things like suicide nets, in Vietnam Apple and other corporations will OWN the local government so there will be nothing reported, and thus no human rights abuses!


If apple cared about human rights abuses they would have moved production when they were exposed, not when an unrelated emergency started to interfere with their profits


>There are tales of literally woke factories up for Apple exec to tour

What does that mean? Like they had mothballed factories that came online for a tour?


Also known as manufacturing clusters. One major reason we can't just "bring back" manufacturing jobs to the us... People don't realize we gutted a whole ecosystem of capability


China would simply steal their products, rebrand them, and sell them for half the price. 

The iAuspicious 12, now with 25% more slave labour!


I'll bet that when they looked into that and realized they couldn't they started working on a redundancy plan so that they could in the future. Looks like some it paid off.


Apple never said that though. Delusional Apple fans said that.


Just think.. apple could have solved the uyghur problem.../s


Foxconn is also a Taiwanese company.


I don’t think it’s so much of a final push, just a convenient  excuse. While they can just pick up and move it looks a lot better if they say we move because x and x reasons.


Clothing industry moved a lot of production to Vietnam.


It's not DNA. It's a virus.


*clap clap*


Well played sir


haha i see what u did therr its amazing


While I agree that Corvid-19 isn't the only reason, the comparison to Influenza is misguided. 

Apple isn't moving production because of the severity of the disease, but because of the massive economic disruptions the subsequent lockdown has caused.


Why would people care if they pull their production it if China?


Covid19 is not as deadly as influenza because it hasn't infected too many people, but it's much more lethal. To put it simply, Influenza kills 1 in 1000, covid19 kills 23 in 1000.


Exactly,  it's not a simple thing to move production to another location. Especially in another country. They had to have been planning this for a long time and now they are either using it as a public excuse or a driver to hasten the process.


Fuck them, they're making billions from American companies while stealing IPs

Man I totally agree with you. I’d loved to see that happen one day.


Could you elaborate on medical production being a top priority?


There is a shipping traffic jam at the ports of China, the Chinese gov't/media is under reporting the severity of the crisis that China is facing


MERS virus outbreak lasted 3 years, I am not sure what made you think outbreak won't last long.


Because of JIT or "just in time" manufacturing, even small delays are very expensive these days.

Used to work for a GM supplier, and we were billed by the minute for any production shutdowns we caused.


> Damaging, but not a bad idea. Besides, the outbreak won’t last that long

Once the effort is put into moving production, supply chains, etc. to a different country, it ain't coming back for a long time.


More like: correcting, a hopeful first start.


Ya know unless it kills us all🤞🤞


I hate it when people are dismissive of what a world changer this thing is


You do this by making it more expensive for them to outsource


This. There's a distinct gap in quality between what few US-manufactured products I own and the rest. More than willing to pay for our high quality standards.


Why is that? How is China’s economy slowing down help US?


Depends if they go that route. Seems like other companies are relocating to Taiwan or Vietnam kr other Asian countries


they aren't going to work because there's a chance they could get it, and take 3 weeks for them to find out, thus enabling them to spread it to all their friends and family. A lot of people are losing their minds in agony right now wondering if they might be infected and who they might have infected-

at the same time people suspected of being sick are being forcable detained to mass quaratine camps, so I can't say i blame them for wanting to avoid the sniffle gulags.


I think you’ve misunderstood a few things.


Its okay. Apple people will still pay for them.


Perfect chance to raise prices... +5% costs, +75% product price. This shit never doesn't get old.


# GUNNA GET YOU!


They have production plants all over the world. They’re not completely overhauling it, more likely just shutting down the ones in China.


Ha. If only.


No way.


And we have a winner, folks. Coronavirus is already in Taiwan so they're going to have to take lots of precautions when they move production there.


No more than any other solid object.  I believe covid19 can survive about 5 hours on a solid object outside of the human body.


People always pay more for better products


There is a chance. It’ll just cost significantly more and we’ll only get a negligible increase in quality.


Maybe in [Usa, Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usa,_Ōita)


My company is moving all of their production to the US. But we are a small niche with huge margins...


Lol, it’s probably cheaper to drive the Chinese workers to the factory in a quarantine van powered by flaming money


Who needs US made when Taiwan numba wan!


Why? Foxconn and other contract manufacturers have plants in the US.


If they are, tump would take credit for tim apple moving production to the US


Your magic jeans are from BWL? Oh, Lemon. It's not "handmade in USA," it's pronounced "hahnd-made in Oosa." The Hand people are a Vietnamese slave tribe, and USA is their island prison. THEY made your jeans. Do you know how they get the stitching so small? [whispers] Orphans.


Mexico would be the closest.


I have seen lots if manufacturing moving from China to Vietnam


Well, we have the Mac pros made in the USA. They cost $40,000. And don’t forget the $1,000 monitor stand.


Extremely unlikely- the fulfillment infrastructure for parts and trained labor outside of APAC are between nowhere and non existent.


If this is what it took for them to do that they are fuct


I can afford it. I've got **two** kidneys!


How about North Carolina


Actually Apple does have some product made in Texas.


If that ever happens then expect an article shortly from The Verge about terrible pay and awful working conditions there


>Haha chance of assembled in USA

FTFY!


Ha, came here to confirm that!


Then they'll be installing suicide nets in US plants.


Not really - we in the US **no longer have the industrial infrastructure, professional engineering networks and financial networks required for that**.  

We gave it all up when we outsourced nearly EVERYTHING of this nature in the 1990s and everything we had in the US largely collapsed.

We could recover it but it will take 20-40 years of **continuous** investment and rebuild.  It's a lot like what you'd have to do to setup up an electronics industry in some developing country that has never had such things (e.g. Sudan).  You can't just magically snap your fingers and undo all the damage done decades ago.  ''

And not even the US is rolling in dough enough to commit to that without shutting down our overseas wars!  It's like any other type of infrastructure like roads, bridges or mass transit.


China number four


TAIWAN NAMBA WAN!


>I have no problem with stuff being made outside of the US; I have a problem with us shipping off manufacturing and IP to our main geopolitical rival.
Taiwan makes good stuff.


Your comment contradicts itself, Foxconn is a Taiwanese company. They produce on the mainland because it’s much cheaper.


Or Indiana


Yeah, my money is on India or Africa.


A very god point.


[deleted]


Yeah they have wiggle room, but shareholders see a margin and if they see that margin decrease they get upset. There is a reason Apple is worth 1trillion and shareholders pay 320 a share. If that decreased margin was offset by increased sales you wouldn’t have a problem. To think a company with shareholders will give up margin for no gain, is dreaming.


Couple extra bucks? If it was only that little, they wouldn't have moved out in first place . Try couple hundred


So much this! A good start would be medical production.


A. Capitalism is literally what defines America. 

B. It costs 181 in parts to make iphones but that will rise up to more than double if they move it to US. Same for the 400 end price.

US doesn't have the supply chain. To get that costs. It isn't just couple bucks. And corporates (esp American) are known to make decisions where huge decrease in quality is acceptable for literal cents off extra profit per customer.


We don’t have the infrastructure necessary. It doesn’t exist. We don’t even have roads capable of moving that volume of product and supplies around the country. You’re talking about orders of magnitude more capacity even if the labor costs could be nailed down.


Comments like yours make me sad for the future of the country.  Sure, the parts and labor only cost $400 (i will assume you're right). But that completely ignores other business expenses.  What about R&D? Interest expenses? Taxes?


Foxconns mobile production in Taiwan was full up until recently. They didn't produce Apple stuff in Taiwan because they were occupied making Google phones like the Pixel.


I'm not trying to claim that apple is doing this for the reasons I listed. I'm saying we should be happy companies are leaving for the reasons I listed.


They could probably get the same wages if they moved to the Caribbean.  There are still plenty of impoverished nations that need a kickstart, and are cheaper for shipping.  Manufacturing in Trinidad and shipping to a distribution center in texas would shave dollars off of their products.


It's not that simple. China has extra power because of its larger size that other countries like Vietnam or Thailand don't have. It wouldn't replicate the same problem.


What country do you think is both worse and a likely spot for these company's to go towards?


Yeah I doubt you can choose a worse country than China


Bit of a non sequitur. Nobody said anything about no longer selling to the chinese. I said we shouldn't be manufacturing so much advanced American tech in a country that simply steals it, undercuts American works by offering little to no rights and is currently committing genocide. Basically I'm saying we need standards.


Sir, this is a wendy's...


I think you misunderstood my point. I didn't say anything about apple doing this out of kindness. I said it's good for the rest of the world.


Like “everyone, get up, it’s midnight but the Apple engineer wants to see how you’re assembling the phone”

Also, if you read my link, there’s also the story, “yes, we can cut the glass. I’ll call the gov bank today, get a loan, build a factory, we will be up and running by the time you figure out your design”


Please dont give them any ideas! Cars have horsepower, next we’ll see phones measured in childpower. iAuspicious will advertise as having the power of 250 working children.

Yup. Beyond limited production capability (hsinchu is TIIIIINY) though, they’re not doing much manufacturing there. Most CMs and ODMs are based in TW, but have their manufacturing elsewhere— generally mainland China. Trump tariffs pushed some mfg back to TW, but real estate prices have skyrocketed and equipment availability has made it hard to bring back to ROC.


Yup and this excuse has better optics then saying it was due to the trade war or raise costs in general.


Ok. It’s not a virus it’s a feature.


 Leave the ravens out of this.


I think they could even say something like “due to Chinese government’s increasing human right violations, we are seizing our production in China”. 

But than China might have banned Apple products in China.


Total speculation? I could see one of two reasons: 

1.	Fear of poorly produced products with unproven countries. Consumers want a product at a fair price, with high quality. They (we) know that China has been proven to be able to handle high demand at low production costs. This gives Apple some financial wiggle room to competitively price different levels of iPads, and not have to worry that their products will break in the hands of its users thanks to shotty made products. By moving production to a country that could be seen as "third world" or not having a solid manufacturing history, may leave consumers feeling their products aren't as good as they were when they were produced in China
2.	A big topic issue right now in America with the upcoming 2020 presidential election is jobs. It always will be. American candidates *love* telling the media, and its voters that they will move more jobs to America and force big companies to do the same. Fact of the matter is, outsourcing is cheaper, and using automation is cheaper than that. Apple moving production *out* of China and not *into* America, doesn't look good. Any other year, it would probably be fine. Tbh, it will probably be fine this year as well, but, knowing how much candidates like to talk/bash corporations not relying on the American work force, I won't be surprised if this doesn't come up

But those are just guesses


People who follow stocks.


Think you might have found the CCP propaganda bot.


Obviously nobody will care about individual companies that are not Apple. What I mean is its about the bigger picture that for example companies that deliver microcontrollers (which are pretty much in every electronic device you can imagine) are struggling to meet the demand.


Exactly


Pretty sure neither Japan nor South Korea would work for cheap labor.

So basically it's as if apple rolls out new products then?


Will you get an increase in quality??


Yesterday there was this debate between a BBC presenter and UK hospitality service head regarding the new immigration rules coming in post Brexit . Presenter asked if you have pay more wages, you could attract local talent and not from EU. Reply from service head went, if we increase pay, the end product price will increase which means we have done nothing to address the gap except show high numbers around wages. Presenter took a while to ask the next question.


Not sure how you'd even get an increase in quality.  Can you explain


TBH, I wonder what the actual production and distribution cost of a single iphone 11 is.


Why would the quality go up?


Increase in quality? LOL have you ever actually bought anything 'Made in the USA'?


They'll just automate everything like every other company promising to move factories back to the U.S.


Honestly I’m okay with paying more for products if it’s not made from actual slave labor.


It probably won't cost that much more. The "assembly" cost is a very small part of the total build cost of almost any electronic product.


India would be the next likely option


Why would quality increase?


In a few more years I suspect the robots will be competent enough for local production.


At least it would provide jobs to US citizens rather than the Chinese, and in addition it would allow the US to further tax Apple and prevent safe heavens


This is not true the issue is more about supply and time


Not even this


If it would be anything like my American car, it'll be worse quality. Awesome car, mechanically great, designed and built so we'll... But then they decided to try put in electronics and Euro features...


Or we can stop allowing corporations to have profit percentages into the 10,000% realm. There’s a certain point where people are too stupid to stop spending money on certain things. How society has allowed cell phones to go into the thousands is beyond me.


Why would the quality be increased?


>increase in quality.

This is debatable because a lot of manufacturing skillsets have been lost due to outsourcing. There are some skills that people can only get good at with experience, ie. it's going to take time. These cannot be trained beyond the basics.


They could afford the loss in profit. But its not about quality or progression anymore.


Why would there be an increase in quality?


https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601491/the-all-american-iphone/

I was surprised by how little a difference it would cost to manufacture iPhones in North America.  I imagine it would be comparable for iPads.


I love how people continue to make this tired ass argument. 

Did prices *fall* when we offshored the middle class?

No. They stayed right where they were. 

So why would they go up?


Maybe those things should cost more so we don't dispose of it so easily.


It wouldn’t cost significantly more by many estimations. Maybe $100. Problem is, they *should* cost more. They use a lot of resources and power. Part of that cost should be recouped by recycling though.


that’s not true: the only reason the chinese low quality is put up with is that it costs a fraction as much. i can buy 10 microphones or whatever gadget and 1 or 2 will work. It isn’t only the product quality, it’s the QA.

The cost of made in usa will be high enough that it would be more cost effective to QA it and make sure near 100% are high quality.

A lot of chinese factories have 0 QA and so you’re just playing a frequency/odds game.

look at any bulk buy setup


Why do you think that US workers could make something with higher quality?


you spelled decrease wrong


It is a myth that items would cost *significantly* more if they were made in the US.

 The price of an item isn't 100% entirely made up of the basic cost of raw components.   

A $100 retail price of something doesn't mean there are $100 worth of parts in it.  The retail price includes the R&D costs, the costs of engineering, the overhead costs for stuff like marketing and accounting, and finally the company's profit.  In the end, the component costs - the cost for all the parts and the assembly cost - usually represents a fraction of the total cost of an item.

https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-it-costs-apple-make-iphone-7-219-parts-5-labor-aapl-snssf/

This article claims the bill of materials for the then new iPhone 7 was about $220.  Labor to assemble it was a mere $5.  Apple doesnt make the screen or the RAM or most of the other components that make up their device.  They simply buy them from other companies, so those would cost the same whether they had them shipped to a final assembly plant in China versus a finely assembly plant in the US.

So companies like Apple (and many, many others) could continue to buy the components that make up their phones and assemble them in the US if they wanted to.  It would probably cost on average 3x the labor cost to do that in the US.  So their labor cost would jump from $5 to $15.  They don't do that purely because of greed.  The final price of an iPhone would only jump around $10 to 25 if it was assembled in the US, but corporate greed keeps them from doing that.


The Mac Pros are already made in Texas, I think.


Increase?


1k for an iphone? HAHA Made in USA $2.5k


We would get a decrease in quality if made in the US.


Increase?


Why would the quality be any better if it was made in America?


iPhone 56! 34 000$ usd with contract


Increase or decrease?


Moving production will either cause a price hike, quality loss, or both.


They also love their margins. 

That's what companies do.


Or possibly a decrease in quality.


Really, significantly more? It comes down to cents on an iPhone after initial costs.


I’d pay more happily


Nope, decrease in quality to help pay for the higher wages.


No increase in quality. They'll just add an led light ring so the 68% chance of the whole thing bricking will at least come with a fancy ring of death to go with  it.


It's really too bad we can't also utilize disposable slave labor in the US. /s


Why do you think there would be a difference in quality? Cheap factory workers output more or less the same stuff than expensive factory workers -- that's why outsourcing that work has been so lucrative for the companies.


It would take them 10 years to build the infustructure and train specialists and what for minimum wage and mostly automated?  The US should focus on the high paid jobs it's good at.  Design the chips and software not make them.   Let China have all the low wage low margins jobs until it gets to expensive there and moves to help improve the lives of the next improvised country.


Or apple will only make $100 profit in each iPad instead of $150. 😂😂😂 Hilarious that they would ever do that.


Am I wrong, though, that if it weren’t for executive bloat and payouts to share holders, Apple could pay Americans fairly for factory production in the states - all while maintaining current costs?

I feel like we’ve been conditioned to believe that this is the cost of doing business, when it’s really the cost of allowing greed into your business...


What is it that you make?


Probably. I'm trying to buy a small volume (10-25) pcbs for a project and the company I normally buy from in China still half shut down. It would normally be ~$50 including shipping from them, but all the quotes I'm getting from the US are like $500-750 minimum for the same amount.


Because of clustering.

But the rest of the supply chain *isn't* in the US.


They already moved production for the iMac Pro to the US.


What are the two in between?


This goes beyond Foxconn and speaks to the deindustrialization of the US (and my region, the Midwest, in particular) over the last 40 years.


Or Indianapolis


Well, read the article and see it is moving to Taiwan.


I imagine there are tons of supply chain optimizations going on in China too - like components being manufactured next door to where the phones are assembled.


>The United States is DECADES behind China and other countries in manufacturing capability.

No. China has a lot of silicon infrastructure (Foxconn) and shit-tons of workers willing to work for practically free, but building similar facilities in the U.S. is not a technological hurdle, just a logistic and payroll one. Heck, it was U.S. firms that designed the original silicon factories in China!

In other types of manufacturing, the U.S. is way ahead of China on a _technological_ basis as well as infrastructure.


It's really time to start rethinking the current system and the whole concept of "companies as a commodity".


Considering that China has had a particular bad history of having disease outbreaks, I don’t think Apple would really wanna risk a massive supply chain break instead of cutting their margins slightly.


They won't "give up" anything voluntarily. We must force them to do what is right.


Wait, let's just make sure that what you're saying is clear.

You're trying to tell me that *China* has better infrastructure *than the United States*?

**Roads**?

Don't be so pessimistic.


But it's definitely tied in. It's less about no longer selling to the Chinese and more do the chinese then still let "us" (us being apple in this context) sell to them. 

Or do they decide that apple's market presence is no longer beneficial to China since they have domestic companies that provide similar quality products and apple is no longer providing the manufacturing labor opportunity they used to. In that scenario, china could easily levy tariffs on imported electronics and apple would be priced out of the market.


I like your ideas and wish to subscribe to your newsletter


You said:

> to decouple the worlds economy so with china to some extent

And that's not going to happen because China is a very important market. You do make a point about them undercutting western manufacturing, but China is no longer just a place to produce stuff for cheap.


That's nuts. Money is crazy.

They could have done that awhile ago. People think they care about that stuff, until their iPhone goes up the next year by 30 to 40% because US labor costs. 

I'd be really curious to see the cost of an iPhone made in China, India, and the US.


Interesting, I wouldn't think people would mind moving it to India in general, at least in your first point. However, your second point sounds like the key:
"Moving out of China and not into America".

I'd be interested to see what happens in this next round of elections. Ultimately though, I don't think it's fair that the US is overlooked as a source due to the cost. I guess that's the point of the tariffs (though it's not really offsetting or changing anything) but that means precious iPhone prices go up, and that makes people mad.


Because the average consumer does not give a shit about microcontrollers.


Correction I meant South Asia where almost all those countries have cheap labor like China


I said cheap labor not slave labor


You’ve been flagged


China enters the room.....


Every little bit helps


Hot take there nephew.


The quality is going down aswell. Don’t give them credit ! 

I told my friends apple slowed down phones when you update them. They thought it was a conspiracy theory

Edit: A fucking slew of apple fanboys below me. How the fuck can anyone think apple is looking out for your best interests. We aren't that fucked up as a society are we? Please say it aint so.


Their new imac 21.5" still comes with a 5400rpm hard drive as "new"


[deleted]


Not for someone like Apple who has the resources and order quantity to bully Asian factories into producing things to spec and doing proper QA testing lest they lose the fat Apple contracts.


Probably not what he meant, but for US production to be financially viable, much more of it would have to be automated, which could increase quality. It just wouldn't add very many new jobs.


He is not wrong. We don't need higher wages, we need deflation.


Would you possibly have a link?


>Reply from service head went, if we increase pay, the end product price will increase which means we have done nothing to address the gap except show high numbers around wages.

This doesn't make sense, and it's an obvious dodge.  You don't increase the price of a product by the exact same amount nor proportion that you increase an employee's wage.

For people who don't understand: I have 10 employees, and I now spend $100 more on each of them, so my business costs $1000 extra.  But I sell 10,000 widgets.  To make up the gap, I only need to charge $0.10 more per widget.  Meanwhile, each of my 10 employees has an additional $100 to use in the local economy, or to uplift society in other ways.  However, raising the price is a worst-case scenario; I could also grow the business in other ways and keep the widget price the same.

Using cheap labor from abroad HURTS the local economy and has negative social consequences.  End of.


You'd get an increase because the insinuation here is that Chinese manufacturers bypass quality control in the name of cheaper production. The truth is that the factories making these have very stringent processes. I'm not an Apple person but have handheld various high-volume Chinese electronics assembly houses and they are almost always willing to go above and beyond to keep your business and their reputation.


Better QC possibly. China isn't known for good quality control most of the time.

Along that same line the build material would be better because the source would be better QC. The metal in particular, China doesn't have strict laws on metalurgy and you really never know what the, let's say, 304 stainless actually is, it could be wildly off, especially if they know its not going to be tested. 

But in this case I don't think these issues are a problem. Apple keeps strict control over the production line.


Apple makes just under 30% net margins. So, about 70% of the total cost. 30% ish is the component cost and the rest goes on logistics, marketing, etc.

It's a question I once took a long look at before and the answer seemed to be no actually. The supply chain does not exist in America.


High precision dimensional and force measuring systems. Metrology field


Supply chain diversification and movement is a thing.


No, none of it is in the US now. If any one has the resources to move their supply chain, it’s Apple. There’s reasons to diversify from China only, but no reason ( except for PR) to move it to the US...we don’t have the labor pool for that kind of work.


Yes, in 2013. Not a Trump achievement, that.


Even if the manufacturing industry returns to your area most of it will be automated. A vast majority of traditional manufacturing jobs will no longer exist.


Thats how most modern fist world countries are though. Shifting away from dirty industrial low wages to higher paying, less environmentally destructive means of production. The US has double it's manaufacturing output since the 80s, but uses 1/3 of the workforce duebto automation. China doesnt have the resources to automate as much as the US does.


Bite your tongue, sir.

You forgot environmental. Chip factories have a lot of nasty byproducts. In China those go right into the river.


As a whole, no. Absolutely not. What they do have is wider roads, bigger trucks, and an unban infrastructure designed around manufacturing not just commuting.


So you think Taiwan will have the same level and intensity of issues regarding IP theft, Human rights abuses which include active genocide? Because that's what I was speaking to, not the virtues of corporate governance.


> they are causing the human rights abuses

I'm sorry I had no idea corporations doing business in China forced the CCP to create concentration camps for one million Uighurs who's "crime" was just being Uighurs. I was also unaware that corporations pioneered the Chinese social credit system as well.... then we have Tianmen square massacre, the great leap "forwards" which caused the starvation of millions...

The Chinese government never needed anyone else's help or encouragement to be horrible to it's own people. I'm not saying these corporations are saints that deserve a pat on the back for using cheap labor but if you're trying to say things are only bad because of outside business influences you need to give your head a shake and look into how the Chinese government treats its citizens.


> Those companies are there to exploit the working conditions in the first place, they are causing the human rights abuses and will bring them along wherever they end up

They are there because labor (or more accurately - production capacity) is competitively priced.


The chinese already do this with many other products. They host our company's until they can create state sponsored clones using stolen tech. Ex. Huawei and Alibaba. The company's that they don't need they don't grant access. We are giving them a free market for their products and they don't do the same to us. We have already created a monster enabling Chinas behaviour this long. We will only make them stronger by continuing.


\>to decouple the worlds economy so with china to **some** extent 

The trade war has already decoupled our countries to a certain extent and now we have COVID-19. Between political unrest, IP theft and working conditions company's are becoming more wary. Im not claiming we are or should immediately cut off all trade. Im just addressing what way the wind is blowing.


They go up that much anyway.


Yeah macroeconomics is one of those subjects that makes my head hurt and I need to sit down for a little bit


It's not just the cost, it's the infrastructure.

My company recently moved production of a product from China to Taiwan because of tariffs, and gave Vietnam a shot as well.

The issue with Vietnam was that they mostly produce clothing and shoes - textile stuff.  Sure we could find an electronics manufacturer, but most of their components would need to be sourced from China anyway, and forget making a last minute substitution or sourcing something on short notice.

Taiwan was much better positioned because they had the array of associated manufacturing industries we needed (electronic components).  But even then a lot of smaller parts still come from China.

Moving production to the US doesn't just mean more expensive labor.  You still need to source materials and components from somewhere, and the US doesn't do a lot of commodity manufacturing. China has a very helpful mesh of industries that all support each other.


Yo give him credit that was a good one


They're all conspiracies until the judge says it ain't so!


Isn’t that done to keep the battery life the same as the battery lifespan decreases?


I’ve had my iPhone 6+ and iPad air 2 for 5  years now, and haven’t had an update slow my devices down. Hell, with my iPad, I’ve had updates speed it up! 
I believe that was an old scandal with the iPad 2 and an iPhone, but I’m pretty sure it ain’t accurate now.

I don’t really see why y’all have to be hostile to people defending this. When there are legitimate points to defend Apple on this issue.

how the fuck could Apple quality go DOWN? it's already the lowest quality shit imaginable


Yes. But I agree. And apple isnt the only one doing this. My advice if you want to keep and old device around is to root it and do run what you want on it.


I have an Android but I'm pretty sure that the updates are meant for the better phones that have better hardware so for them to be able to run on an older phone they need to be throttled down a bit. Picture you own a PC from 2009. You'd be able to play older games from that time on max settings. However if you bought a gpu intensive game made in 2020 you'd have to play it on low or medium settings since your computer simply can't handle the game.


Same mindset in politics, humans are weird.


My venerable MacBook bricked after the last update.   I called Apple and the customer service person said you should call engineering and tell them how you feel.  Yeah....right.....it’s still bricked and I doubt I’ll buy another apple product again.  That is after the last 3 MacBooks I had essentially crapped out too for no good reason.


Well, the world is sliding in to fascism from Hungary, to Brazil, to the UK to the US. We keep buying more and more expensive shit we dont really need at great cost to humanity and the environment so... Yeah. We are that fucked up.

Apple fanboys will defend apple to their graves. I feel like apple could spit in their coffee and make them drink it while they make them watch as they bang their wife and they will make up an excuse to why its okay.


Why is it a conspiracy theory when Apple admitted to doing so, and then was found to have been dishonest about what “slowing down” meant?


On your edit, of course they think that way. They suck the dick of the company for anything they release, and for whatever price is advertised.


I thought apple was just recently fined or sued  for doing it. How is it a conspiracy. It's been official for ages.


Apple doesn’t make phones unusable. You can use iPhones for many years, as opposed to android phones which become a buggy slow mess in 18 months.


As a software engineer, I think its not that they intentionally slow down phones. They actually add new and powerful features considering their newly launched phone has better specs and can handle it fine. But it adversly affects older phones because of its lower specs.

Maybe they can fix that by putting more effort in optimizing features for older phones. But it again comes up to return of investment in effort. So they don't do it.

Just saying.


They don’t “slow down your phone” for no reason. It’s to help save the battery. Know what you’re talking about before spewing out misinformation.


> Edit: A fucking slew of apple fanboys below me.

So, I read that as, “A fucking slew of apple fanboys **blew** me.” Which makes the rest of what you said even more hilarious.

Automation wouldn’t be enough. One of China’s advantages is the flexibility they have when wielding a workforce of 5k workers all living in a single production facility/campus. 

Need 1000 workers to click a button non-stop for a 12 hrs shift to test it’s durability? No problem, 48hrs turnaround time. Re-configuring an automated machine to do the same task in the same timeframe is not possible.


Serious question, wouldn't deflation cause other unwanted ripples throughout the economy because people would rather save money instead of spending it? Don't we intentionally cause inflation so this doesn't happen?


Or a lower cost of living...


You mean lower income/wealth inequality


it doesn't matter either way.

I agree on the cheap labour part but what if a low skilled worker demanded the salary of a high skill worker primarily because the set pay for a low skill worker is only a tiny percentage higher than what they would get in benefits?

What if they just don't want to do it? Hospitality sector has about 13% from EU who are willing to work in shifts, relocate to different locations and also have the skill.


Yeh, if anything. Their experience the past few decades producing high volume products would make their quality higher.

No shit Sherlock. Automation still requires labor. Robots and conveyor belts can’t fix themselves. It’s better than nothing, which is what we currently get. But, hey, the guy on Wall Street gets his cut, so everything’s fine.


It’s doubled its output but the capital that results from manufacturing has been concentrated, and no social safety net has been set up for those who got screwed in the offshoring frenzy of the 80s and 90s. The concentrated capital has given rise to a more corrupt and untouchable elite as well, particularly on the coasts.


>The logistical hurdle alone would take decades.

It doesn't take decades to build a phone factory.

>There are 2.8 million active factories in China. It would take decades for the US construction industry to even build that many. 

Sure, if you built them one by one for some reason. And besides, only a small fraction of those are phone factories.

>That level is lower than the workforce we would need to match Chinese output.

American manufacturing is highly automated. It's pointless to compare workforce numbers. Look at the actual output; they're pretty similar.


Not to mention more relaxed environmental protection laws, labor laws, etc. We are also overestimating the number of workers who are willing to work manufacturing jobs when "higher value" jobs like R&D are available.


You're serious.

Competitively priced because they treat humans as slaves


Lol, dude I have 0 clue when it comes to that stuff, but where I see it:

America raced to the bottom of price wars. Companies had to get lower and lower over time, because they have a feduciary obligation to increase stock prices. That meant for the probably 5 decades we went from "proudly made in America" to "sourced globally". Hell, Craftsmen tools can't even tell you where their wrenches came from.


We got spoiled on cheap labor, cheap gas, cheap corn. People don't want to pay $50 for an iPhone case made in America, they want the $10 case made in China. How the economics work out of it, I dunno. But people would have to start saying.. yeah I'll buy American over forgein first for market to shift production here.

If only you could buy a new battery for $25 and replace the old one.


Create OS that requires more resources and can’t run properly on older models. 

People get pissed at slower phones not knowing why their $900 phone suddenly runs like crap. 

People feel incentivized to buy new phone. This is the reason they did it. 

Apple did none of this benefit consumers you sweet summer child.


yes.  but also the new IOS was built around newer phone models so it was more resource intensive, and therefor required more battery power, so it magnified these results.  

Android also suffered from the same issue, but didn't slow down your phones due to the more resources to save battery, so instead you just ended up with shorter battery life.  and slightly slower phones. 

Even computers are guilty of this,   Buy a new computer, works great when you first get it, years later you notice it's slowed down a lot, so you reinstall everything thinking it will run like new.   while there are some improvements after reformating and installing everything again, it still doesn't feel like it was when it was new.  And that's because of windows updates,  the constant updates to your OS and all the programs are often assuming you are upgrading your computer as well, so they are slightly more resource intensive causing everything to be a bit slower.

At the end of the day.  it feels like they are forcing you to upgrade.  but it comes from them being forced to upgrade to keep up with the times in order to stay competitive, to offer all the newest bells and whistles and security updates.   and that in turn causes consumers to need to upgrade with them to keep up.   Ultimately they are in the business of making money.   So there's no drive for them to keep a light version of OS upgrades for older products.  They want you to upgrade.


imagine unironically defending this shit


Im confused as to what you are saying.

I had an iphone 4s that I didn't update for literally years. Worked fantastic. My friend updated it one day last year and it was a fucking brick. Could barely open safari.

By updating my phone it put it into "limp mode". Thats not preventing it from shutting down. That is straight up gimping it.


It doesn't change the fact that it's planned obsolescence. They kept this fact a secret until they were forced to admit it.


No it doesn't, it just pulls timing.


>apple slowed down phones ~~when you r update them~~the battery they designed to fail inside of a year was failing but didnt tell anyone they were doing it to encourage people to just buy new phones because their old one was slow. And now a bunch of scrubs run around regurgitating their PR they released when they got caught. They have been found guilty of planned obsolescence in court so suck it.

FTFY

And before we even go down this path, stfu with your "it's just what happens to li-ion batteries they didnt design it".

Yes they did you imbecile strawman who will inevitably show up to argue this exact uneducated point anyway, they don't just play the lotto and pick a random battery design to put in a device, they design a battery to be able to deliver the power the device needs for a lifespan that is an amount of time they deem it should be able to do so. In other words, every engineer working with the battery knows they degrade and will account for that when designing the battery so that the device will have "x" lifespan before degredation reaches a point where it can no longer deliver the voltages required. This is why they can deliver the voltage necessary after 100 charges, for example. The batteries aren't pushing their max straight out of the box, even apple isnt that stupid.

I prefer a phone that doesn't get updated anymore but still keep working fine, rather than a phone which gets update that makes it nearly unusable.


I think the term brick is a bit of a stretch


The general public will just buy a new phone sadly


LMAO, I use my Android phones for a minimum of two years, and not once have they become "buggy and slow." The battery life goes down, but not by insane amounts. I've been using my current phone for three years.


My Galaxy S7 is almost 4 years old and still feels like the day I got it. You might have gotten a shitty phone or just had really bad luck.

You mean like how billionaires save their 21 trillion dollars in hidden accounts on some remote islands instead of putting it back into the economy?


So consumer spending probably wouldn't really be affected. Regurgitating untested economic 101 quips suggests that nobody saves now.


The entire inflation issue is because too many people save too much right now.

With deflation the bond markets on the other hand would be roiled and very tricky for issuers.


I think what the person was trying to say is that the cost of living needs to go down.

It's a myth that imported workers are doing jobs uniquely suited for them and/or that they bring unique capabilities with them.  The job market simply changed to exploit the easily exploitable.  It can change again, and it should.


And their entire supply chain is more or less local as well. The supply chain logistics of making electronics in the US would be significantly more complicated


Specialized (I mountain bike as a hobby, no commuting), and it’s actually probably assembled in Taiwan which I didn’t know! I just knew it was an American company. I don’t actually care whether or not things are made in the USA, I just buy quality stuff when I know I’ll use it often and I hate seeing people circlejerking against America on Reddit.


Agree. Uncle Tim has talked about more US production, but there is nothing driving that. Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, maybe India could be assembly centers. But the components are coming from China. And I think any work in the US would just be top level assembly.


They can move to Mexico/Tijuana where foxconn also has plants. Plus they will be a whole lot closer to Cupertino and can rapidly change product design and prototype.


The Mac Pro came out in 2013, and that’s when those manufacturing lines opened up.


Yeah but a 40 year who doesn't even remember his high school mechanics won't be able to retrain to fix these advance robots. You need a proper degree and/or programming experience to be good at making and fixing these things.


Those are societal problems that have been an issue since we've had civilization. Maybe we need to stop worshipping money and capotalism as the end all be all of any socio-economic system.

I think the biggest thing the public needs to understand is automation. Just because companies are here, *doesn't* mean they're going to humans. Amazon being a prime example where so much is done by automated machines, that there are fewer places for unskilled/unqualified personnel. The American education system fails to prepare students for a world where coding/computer science degrees will become more and more demanded. This doesn't mean that people aren't being employed, it means they're unemployable. I love what Kentucky did about a year ago when coal mines shut down. They funneled those workers into coding programs and paid for them so that these workers aren't ehf'd


it costs $29


This is my view as well.  A bit anecdotal but a great example of this phenomenon for me was when I picked up a free phone and got to keep my old contract at a time when data got way more expensive and new phone prices blew up.  The reason they let me do this involved a lot of bitching on my end so to get rid of me and not lose a customer they gave me a phone that was near 2 model years back and I kept my data plan.  I didn't care cause I needed the deal.  For about 6months I was able to resist upgrading OS and the phone ran beautifully, at some point I could no longer avoid it and bang, no more ultra smooth operation.  Mostly it was in google maps with that update, definately not written to operate well on a phone with my specs.. later updates affected more apps.

I don't know, this makes perfect sense to me probably because like you I've had exactly the same experiences with laptops and I also appreciate the labour hrs involved in writing code and optimizing, I just don't see a company ever investing that much to keep old hardware running perfectly with new software.  Only way to do this is if you can use your laptop 80% offline and nothing is sensitive, I usually have an image of a fresh install right after purchase and I get old software to run on it, that works perfectly but theres a very limited number of scenarios where that even makes sense to do.

Not saying Apple didnt benefit from slowing phone hardware over it's life, or didn't understand that that was happening, or weren't allowing this knowing the effects would be to their benefit.  The story though is a little bit more complex than a room full of scheming executives devising plans to screw us at every single turn and if only they didn't then our phones would run ultra smooth for 10 years, it's more in between the 2 extremes.  God I hate conspiracy theorists, I hate that I was born into this era lol


Oh wow, who would have thought that updating a decade-old mobile device to a significantly more powerful operating system with much heftier hardware requirements would cause the phone to run slower


Its forced obsolescence.


It’s got not even the faintest thing to do with planned obsolescence.


[removed]


Yeah, one thing that never ceases to amaze me is how Apple, of all phone manufacturers, get shat on for “planned obsolescence”. 
Their most current phone OS — iOS13 — supports every iPhone as old as iPhone 6S (released in 2015). 
I once got a midrange Android phone the month it was released, it stopped getting new versions of Android in a year. At this point getting an iPhone you can expect at least around 5(!) years of support. An yes, some slowdown will happen after half a decade of use and updates, sure. But some of Apples updates are officially made to speed up newer iOS versions on older devices. All this probably has something to do with a pretty good resale value on all the Apple stuff.
Don’t get me wrong — I believe all companies engage into “planned obsolescence” to a degree — they are not our friends, they just want to make a buck (don’t get me started on the hole headphone jack shit show)!
It just fascinates me how Apple always get singled out for “planned obsolescence” when they probably have the longest software support for their hardware on the market today. Correct me if I am wrong — is it standard for Android phone manufacturers to issue OS updates five years into a phone’s life?

EDIT: “seizes to amaze” — D’oh!


So everyone else’s batteries don’t suffer the same fate? Even the playing field and you see that all phone batteries, especially after excessive use start to fade around the 1-2 year mark


You can be upset with their lack of transparency and you can shit all over them for their response when everything went public. I don’t care 🤷‍♂️ I’d agree with you. But I hate conspiracy theories and mistruths. The batteries aren’t designed to fail, they are just batteries. Could you argue it was designed to force upgrades? No because no one knows. You can only opine. 

But I ask if you are going to argue that case then why not argue it’s conspiracy that LG and early Galaxy devices continuously got stuck in reboot loops (not counting the numerous reboot loop issues with differing Nexus devices, screen issues, etc)? Was that some big upgrade conspiracy too? I’m being rhetorical. 

Maybe Hanlon’s razor applies here and we don’t need conspiracy to explain things. Just don’t state opinions as facts — it’s in poor form and not beneficial to discussion.

If your definition of working fine is not receiving new features or security updates after an insufficient length of time, then I agree with you.


It’s literally written in the code dumbass, read it yourself or listen to someone who can.


Only money held in a Scrooge McDuck vault isn’t getting put back into the economy. Money in banks goes out as loans (that are spent in the economy) and money in investments gets out to be spent just the same.


right but i'm not confident it can.

&#x200B;

I'm starting to look at dollars as representing a % of time worked, rather than monitary value.

&#x200B;

So, if  "widget" is $12.00, and minimum wage is $12.00, it is decided by the people of the world who buy "widget" regularly, that the maximum amount of life-hours they are willing to give up for the widget is 1 hour.

&#x200B;

Now, you can increase their pay from $12 to $300, or decrease it from $12.00 to $1.00, it doesn't matter, because we, the buyers of the widget, have all come together in an unconscious decision that we will give up 1 hour of our life to buy it.

&#x200B;

I think there's 3 impossible ways to get what you want, you want the cost of the widget to go down from 1 hour of life, to, let's say, 30 minutes. So it's half off.

&#x200B;

1.) Every widget buyer on earth can all agree not to buy a single widget if it's over 30 minutes of life's payment. This is impossible because people are greedy, and they'll buy buy buy when it gets low, ruining hte market for the true buyers that want it to get to 30 minutes.

&#x200B;

2.) The makers and sellers of the widget can say "welp, we know we can sell it at 1 hour of life pay, but let's arbitrarily decide to sell it at 30 minutes worth of lifepay, effectively reducing our income by half." But this is impossible, are you willing to take a pay decrease by half? you personally? You are not, right? No one is.

&#x200B;

3.) The government can force them to sell it at 30 minutes of life pay. This is the most doable option, but f\*ck man, it's a rough line to cross, because who is to say where the line is drawn?? This kind of power given to a governing body historically ends in deaths of thousands.


There are high quality products made everywhere and low quality ones too.


There isn't a circlejerk against America. American manufacturing isn't coming back though. And as an often stated example bicycles and electronics cannot be made here anymore. The supply chain and efficiencies do not exist.


It’s not just coding, all sorts of expertise from chemistry to industrial engineering is in short supply in the US because of our education system, even ignoring the cost of labor It would be difficult to move production to the US because of this skills gap


So yeah, I agree that automation (as in automated manufacturing facilities)  is taking over, but as someone in the IT architect field, automation is coming there too. So just having everyone switch to stem isn't going to solve that problem as the IT industry is already getting too crowded. Actually we're seeing a resurgence in trade skills because of that, plumbers, electricians, hell if you work for custom fabrication or welding, you can make a very decent living. Sadly IT is top heavy, lots of middle management, project management, ITIL management,.. but no one doing any work, because that's being replaced. So I think it's also some keeping up with the Jones's. Mike's over there, a project manager, making 6 figures, does jack shit, doesn't know shit, somehow vital. Meanwhile Susan is busting her ass welding, making decent 5s, but a bit of envy. Her husband, Bill, network engineer, nearing 6 figures, but he's tasked with basically writing out his job.  He also know Mike's an asshat cause he's doing all his work.

It's certainly a sticky situation regardless. As for the case with apple moving out of China, I don't think anyone will move anywhere. Labor over there is so cheap and we just keep not caring about those working conditions, as long as apple keeps us happy. Ignorance is bliss


conspiracies have always existed for as long as there was civilization.
so you can't avoid that.   but because the world (was) getting into a good place,  people could worry more and more about trivial things.


Not to mention they damned near give them away. A bargain at twice the price.

That's correct.


I dunno, I just got rid of my Nexus 5 because the battery seem to have lost 25% of it's capacity or something.  
Don't know how old it was, but more than a year or two.


So you whole argument is whataboutism? Noice.

Companies design their batteries to accomplish certain parameters. Fact. Not opinion.


It is misguided to group every single Android device as one "brand".


Not receiving new features doesn't change the phone's usability. Even Apple doesn't backport many of  it's new features when upgrading older phones. It would be like saying your current car becomes unusable because it doesn't have the heated mirrors that's on the newer model.

The fact that you were downvoted for understanding/explaining macroeconomics 101 is upsetting. It shows how uninformed Reddit can be.


Loans to rich people leveraging their wealth into investments which increase their personal wealth and the interest they pay on the loan goes against their business expenses which means the pay less tax and the public suffers for it.


I'm 110% HIV and coronavirus positive that the money on Cayman Islands doesn't go out as loans. They're completely hidden for tax avoidance purpose so they're definitely not for investments. This isn't a small amount either. It's $21 trillion well protected from taxation and legal judgment.


It fuels debt and drives even more inflation ultimately generating poverty.


Not the point

Don’t forget about trades as well.  We have a very real shortage of tradesmen like welders, plumbers and electricians, amount other things.


> Samsung still fully supports the s6

In what ways? Not being snarky, it just seems its last update was 7/Nougat and its last security update was a year and a half ago so I'm unsure how it's still being supported.


Sorry, cannot verify this by looking at the Galaxy S6 Wikipedia page. What I am seeing is this:


Operating system —
Original: Android "Lollipop" with TouchWiz 5.0;
First major update: Android "Marshmallow" with Touchwiz 6.0;
Second major update: Android "Nougat" with Samsung Experience 7.0;

Android Nougat seems to have been released in August 2016. Since then there seems to have been 2 major versions of Android (Oreo and Pie) not officially supported by the S6. That implies it wouldn’t get the new Android Oreo already in 2017 (2 years after the phone’s release). The S6 and the iPhone6S were released the same year (2015). 

The iPhone 6S originally came with iOS9 — it’s on iOS13 right now, meaning it received 4 major OS updates since it’s release ( last update was to 13.1.3 in 2020). Now, I understand that the S6 might still get some security updates and you can use custom ROMs and such. However, I was specifically wondering about Samsungs official support for major Android versions on the device — something that the vast majority of S6 users will deal with. Am I missing something?


[removed]


What are you talking about, I didn't even get pie on a s6


My S8 isn't even getting the current version of Android.


There was another issue being seen that the processor showdown was used to fix and a lot of people have forgotten about. It was an unexpected shutdown issue with older phones drawing more power than the battery could provide when it had a lower charge and a degraded battery. It showed up on the 6s when the 8 was released. Personally, I’d rather have a slower, working phone than a faster phone that shuts off at random times, but Apple *did* do a bad job in communicating *that* was what the fix was for.

You read one headline and think you know how everything works.


Investments are literally an economic positive externality, it’s a huge contributor to economic growth which makes the public better off.

Also, that increased personal wealth comes back to the tax roles once they stop investing it or switch investments, so it’s a deferral of revenues that comes back to the government with dividends once that money isn’t being put towards a publicly beneficial use and they actually want to spend any of it on anything (even other investments).


Sorry to hear about your ailments... illegally stashing money in the Caymen islands is indefensible and should receive *much* harsher international scrutiny.  That said, it *does* operate like any other banking system... it isn’t just sitting in the accounts or in vaults, the banks loan that money right back out... it’s literally *why* they want to attract international money by creating extremely lax local laws and oversight in the first place, it’s *why* they do it, so that *they* can be the ones making loans with that money rather than some bank in the home country.

>	The cost of the metal — mainly used to produce lithium-ion batteries, but also for pharmaceuticals and industrial lubricants — has been soaring. An index of key prices more than doubled in the first quarter, after surging 280% last year, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

Expect lithium-ion batteries to get more expensive everywhere pretty soon. It’s not surprising Apple has increased their prices though, they never leave money on the table. Other manufacturers might absorb extra costs, but Apple pretty much never does.


Batteries are the major consumable degradable parts of the iPhone. Replacing it should cost as little as possible. 69 was not cheap either the battery itself cost no more than 19. Apple should at least remove the software locks for batteries so that people can easily and cheaply replace it themselves without knowing how to transfer the old battery board from the old battery to the new battery.


Man, I've been in this ecosystem since so many years now, but these"quirks" that Apple has developed within their ecosystem over the recent years have made me reconsider my future purchases. Like this lack of self repairability, awful Siri experience (esp noticable after I used my friends' Pixel), Apple Music deleting my playlists after getting off it for a month, etc. 

I already regret getting the 14 Pro, with the awful third party app camera experience, and the worsened battery life.


I went to an Apple Store a few days ago because my iPad Air battery kinda sucks. 

And they said they don’t do battery upgrades anymore


Fuck has this started already?! Ive need to replace my macbook battery for a while but haven’t gotten around to it


Like everything else in life lately..


This will just add more e-waste. We cant have charging blocks because apple is supposedly being eco conscious, but then they pull this.

Would've been surprised if they reduced the price

The Razor  🪒 and the Blade, ‘eh?


I really wish they would enforce removable batteries like they do with USB 3.1 power ports. Needing expensive and inconvenient work to replace a battery because of somebody's design decisions should be unacceptable these days.


This signals an increase in overall battery prices everywhere. I know certain components have increased in price so this makes sense.

Apple likes a steady revenue percentage so if their cost rises, so will ours. But again, this means that all battery prices are likely to increase


Hence why I just traded my 16” pro for a new Mac mini. Battery replacement was gonna be $250 and no I’m not doing that myself cheaper, it’s a mess with the 16”


Aligns with the plunging terrible service over the last several years. But 4ppL3c4re! Apparently the $300 Mac Pro wheels were not the windfall they expected.


Dang it!

I have 2 iPhone 6S’s, an iPhone 11 Pro Max, and an iPhone 11 Pro that I was going to get their batteries replaced last month, but then ran out of time. I should have done it.

One of the riches companies in the world does not need to charge more than $49 for a battery replacement on an old iPhone 6S.


They just want people to get new phones..


they’re returning the prices back to normal after lowering them because of the cpu throttling they got caught doing via firmware


Good thing their products are only getting cheaper!


…and at the same time increased the trade in values.


If it wasn’t for the iMessage cult in the USA I’d throw my iPhone in the trash

A whole $20. Zzzzzzzz Zzzzzzzz


You’re better off just selling that iPhone X than spending $70 on a new battery.


I got my battery replacement for free from the Apple Store last year on my 2018 MacBook Pro lol I didn’t even have Apple care


Almost like inflation is a thing


But why?


In my area, they had already changed this prices 2019. I tried getting another phone’s battery updated and it was expensive then.


Do they still restrict battery replacements to only if battery capacity falls below 80%?


My M1 MacBook with light use was at 48% battery health after 15 months. 

Felt like a scam to get it replaced, and now it'll be even more expensive if I get another defective battery, great.


At least we got a warning this was coming. I had my 12 Pro serviced right before the price hike.


How can they reach 3 trillion market cap if they don’t charge us more. duh


And Apple has nuked 3rd party replacements while simultaneously not shipping OEM/Genuine batteries to 3rd parties.

My OG iPhone SE remains strong


They announced this months ago btw. Just went into effect. 

I took my MBP a couple days before so I could get the old price


I don’t think anyone who was planning to take it to Apple would be comfortable replacing it themselves, nor is anyone who is comfortable doing that would want to spend extra money getting someone else to do it. 

I fall into the former camp and if their battery replacement prices aren’t competitive then I’d simply go with a trusted third party store.


I replaced my MacBook battery from ifixit and the battery is actually junk. It’s practically worse than the bad OEM battery I had, and ifixit wouldn’t do anything about it. Never again.


That will cause any malfunction because of the software limitations when you change your own battery?


I love all my apple stuff and it works amazing but motherfuck is it a downside to like maintain and stay current. 

I’m gonna iFixit my battery.. I’ve never worked on an iPhone 11 tho which is what I have. Gon be an experience.


I've done that a few times. Their instructions are great.


Just replaced my se 2020 battery myself 💪


Dors ifixit sell original apple parts? As far as I know only Apple has the original parts and doesn‘t give them to 3rd party shops to sell.


Wish my salary was increased this way


Clearly just inflation, ignore the record profits.


It’s 149€ for the 2017 iPad Pro 10.5. It’s a 3 hour job according to ifixit…

Imagine a world where devices are user serviceable.


Hopefully introduce a snazzy new AR/VR headset.


Yay capitalism! Gotta love the typical capitalist cycle: Have a stable business model > Chase growth for the sake of growth > Overcharge for products/services > Massive layoffs > Close multiple locations > Death spiral!

While I think Apple is far too big for the death spiral part to actually kick in, it’s ridiculous how predictable our capitalist system has become. Almost as if a system predicated on endless year over year growth is akin to cancer and is therefore unsustainable 🤔


That’s not surprising, their Mac trade in values are absolute garbage.


Yeah. My wife and I considered getting 14 Pros, but ultimately decided to replace the batteries on her XS Max and my 11 Pro. Unless the 15 or the 16 is just super tempting, we shouldn’t *need* to upgrade until 2025, if Apple follows the usual iOS cutoff pattern.


Tim knows that you're part of the 1%.

Everyone else will still be buying the newest iPhones.


Which model you on?


Still rocking an X and I have no desire to upgrade, although I'm an iOS nerd (meaning that I look forward to the major iOS updates every year) and I'm sure at some point my X will stop being supported for new iOS updates. Though with iOS updates having a wide net in terms of what models they support, I don't necessarily need the newest model if I ever did upgrade. I think my next upgrade will probably be the 12, and then I'll stay on that for a good while. Don't see the need to have the 13, 14, 15, or even 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. There's just no point.

The downside of capitalism. The overall most valuable company in the world and the shareholders will still flip their shit of Apple doesn’t find a way to increase profits year over year.


Companies will never experience a reality check if people continue to throw money at them.


> after massively raising prices of everything?

I don't disagree that Apple's bottom line is plenty healthy and this is unnecessary, but where did they raise prices massively? The Mac mini is the cheapest (and most powerful) it's ever been. Everything else is pretty comparable to where it was a couple years ago. 

Hell. The MacBook Air m1 might be the best value proposition on the market for someone who needs more than a Chromebook but doesn't need a mobile workstation.

12 Pro Max with 90% here. It does seem the battery health degraded a lot within the past year. Also, battery life in general has gotten worse. Not sure how much of this can be attributed to recent iOS updates.


Yeah I specifically noticed it after 16.1. Ive talked to some friends with the 12 pro max and they've all experienced the same thing sometime after ios16.


Interesting, my 11 Pro that I’ve had since launch is still going strong at 88%.


What the my Xr is at 87% health.


My 13 Pro is already 88% 😐


Yup. Have the regular 12 and my battery is also at 81% and it’s telling me to get it serviced. My tinfoil hat says it’s something with the 12 series but what do I know.


89% on my 12 Pro Max. Even on days with heavy video watching it still lasts a full day for me. It’s bed time now and still 50%.

Eta: just realised that it charges in the car holder, so that half hour boost on the way home from work probably skews my results a bit!


Mine is at 84%. But yes, especially after ios 16 launched the battery health went from 94% to 89%. And ever since then it dropped to 84%


Iphone XS i got at launch is at 87% health. May upgrade soon, screen on time is about 5 hours between charges


My 12 mini went down to 82% in about a year and a half and hasn’t decreased any more


Mine droped from the high 90s to 87 with iOS15, but since then it didn’t change


Are you in a cold climate?


Generally that’s how it is, the battery degrades further when it charges up from a true 0% charge. The iPhone typically shuts down at a false 0% charge when it actually has some charge left to avoid actually degrading the batteries.

This protective charge also degrades as the whole battery degrades so it kind of compounds the degradation problem.

81 percent for a 12 pro, two year in is amazing tbh. I would try to get it charged as soon as it hits 10%, it can totally drag it out for 2 more years. 80% and above is still considered normal battery state.


Probably a placebo. The more your health decreases, the more you have to charge the phone, and thus more battery health decreasing.


Batteries are very inconsistent in their max health degradation due to different materials being used in different areas by different manufacturers. These materials are swapped and changed all of the time as well and can cause results to vary drastically. Electronics with networking are always in a constant testing period until they stop support so they can continue to tweak, tune and cut costs on components within.

As someone who worked at a repair shop for cell phones last year, I can tell you Ive seen iPhone 7s and 8s that have had 0 battery replacements and still didn't need them. Comparatively, I've had iPhone 11s and 12s that were coming in for battery swap number two after dropping below 80% once again.

This doesn't mean newer batteries are garbage or that older phones are necessarily better for battery life. I've also seen the opposite for both eras on devices. This just means batteries are going to provide inconsistent results due to the endless combinations of components, manufacturers and quality standards that go into making the components.

TL;DR Battery health will always be luck of the draw.

Tim "ROI" Cook.


I wonder if this has to do with the general “inflation” all big named products have experienced lol oculus quest 2/PlayStation 5/Xbox etc


It’s like a 22.5% increase (one the one price change I plugged in). Want to guess what inflation has been since they started the program? One guess…


The phone market is basically saturated. To keep income increasing the best way is to milk the existing customers unfortunately. 

It turns out perpetual rapid growth is impossible.


Their market share in the U.S. is plateauing, so they need to either find revenue elsewhere or cut costs.


Its a business, but yeah definitely

people are replacing iphones less so apple charging more for maintenance


It's been a money milking machine looooooong before the X lmao


They’re finding the limits of capitalism. Their share holders demand infinite growth, but how does a company as large as Apple continue to grow? Their userbase is as large as it can feasibly get. So they’ll do this nickel and dimeing until they inevitably see a decline and can achieve some real growth again.


What caused the shortages? Because alot of these "environmental" reasons are just corporations lying.

Eggs went up in the US and Canada, but chicken did not. You go to Mexico and the prices are the same. You try and bring the eggs over the border and border patrol will either destroy them or force you to declare them as if you bought diamonds.

The price of Pepsi and Coke has gone through the roof. There is no shortage of materials or ingredients.


What does this have to do with the cost of battery replacements?


I remember there was a YouTube video I watched on shortages last year from coffee beans to lithium mining materials. Looks like it is starting to hit


That article is outdated. 

Currently lithium metal costs about 20-30 less expensive vs few months ago 

You can check Lithium metal price here:

They don’t repair iPads, they replace them no matter what the issue is. They have a lower price if the battery has failed. If the battery doesn’t fail testing, they won’t replace your iPad for the battery cost, and if there’s nothing else failing they won’t offer a replacement whatsoever.


[deleted]


They release four or five new phones every year and immediately discontinue the ones they’re replacing that have only been out for a year. The idea they give a shit about e-waste is hilarious.

However, a new battery is objectively cheaper than a whole new phone, and creates less waste than buying a whole new phone, so I don’t understand why you think this adds more e-waste.


I went through some old electronic boxes that I hoard and couldn’t figure out why I still had them. When going to throw them away almost all of them had wall warts and cables in them. 

It’s not necessary anymore.


We don't *need* charging blocks because everyone already has one.  It IS e-waste.  There are options besides Apple to replace your battery, so if you don't want to spend the extra amount with Apple it doesn't mean you can't do it somewhere else.


That eats into profits so it won’t happen.


It's not so much a question of tech - the tech exists. It's a question of what compromises have to be made to enable users to hot-swap batteries. And there are quite a few. Neglecting any cost argument, it's still not free.

And users have spoken pretty loud and clear: easily swappable batteries just aren't that important to people - most literally couldn't care less, which is why pretty much every single phone OEM has dropped the idea. Especially for flagships.


Apple literally serialized batteries to lock out features if you replaced the battery yourself. 

So that particular thing is probably not gonna come from Apple lol.


Not very many people change their car as often as they change their phone, and the battery really only needs replaced after 3-4 years, a time when most users would consider buying a new phone anyway. I don’t see how this will contribute to e-waste at all. The people who were thinking about upgrading will upgrade anyway, the people who want to keep their phone as long as possible will still work out replacing the battery is cheaper than replacing the phone.


I said it months ago when the EU said they wanted to make batteries easily removable that they really should have worked on trying to cap the cost of batteries instead. From my experience the biggest barrier to repair isn’t access, it’s cost. They should have worked on the cost part instead of the access part IMO.


Wow that is pretty involved. I still have my 2011 that I need to replace the battery on. Makes mine look stupid easy.


Is the 6s worth the money to replace their batteries even before the price hike? Just feels like that model is too outdated to even put money into


They returned to normal prices over 4 years ago.

There is absolutely no reason that one of the richest companies in the world need to raise a $49 battery replacement for an old iPhone 6S to $69.


>nor is anyone who is comfortable doing that would want to spend extra money getting someone else to do it.

I've done a lot of my own hardware repair, but as I get older and busier with family and career it's just not worth it to save a couple bucks. 

Now, if we were talking about a part that I could get for $50 and apple wanted $700, that would be a different story.


I’m comfortable doing it but these days I simply can’t be bothered.


If I ever needed to, I’d probably replace my battery at Apple. Not because I can’t, but because everything already has applecare so a battery replacement is cheap as chips if not free.


Eh, I've done various phone repairs on my own, and if it were price competitive to get them done at Apple I absolutely would. On my 6S Plus, the optical image stabilizer partially broke, causing the lens to violently shake (making it impossible to capture anything not blurry.) Since Apple doesn't let you turn OIS off, I had to replace it. Unfortunately, I tore the ribbon cable for the front camera and earpiece since they're so incredibly thin. No problem, I ordered another... which I also tore. I ordered another and closed up the phone and it was good as new (except not really because the auto-brightness no longer worked, but oh well.) Anyway, it wasn't very fun, and I went a fair bit of time with my phone partially not working since I needed to order replacement parts for each thing that broke, but despite breaking a completely unrelated part to the original problem and replacing it twice, it still was significantly cheaper doing it on my own then having Apple do that (again, despite buying two parts that wouldn't have been needed had I not broken them.)

Later I slipped and fell onto the road and bent that 6S Plus quite severely (I ordered a replacement screen but couldn't easily get it in due to the frame being bent), so I switched to a relative's old 6S (which I'm still using). The battery was awful, so I replaced it (which a few months after replacing its health is already down to 81%, and it's from iFixit!) But the screen, having never been removed, did not come apart well and the latching mechanisms broke off. I had to order a replacement screen, which is really bad (touch accuracy is awful, no 3D touch, backlight bleeding), but again, this was still cheaper than going with Apple.  

Anyway, my experience repairing Apple devices isn't very good or fun, so I'd gladly pay Apple to do it if it weren't extremely overpriced. But it is. And I've struggled to find good 3rd party parts for iPhones, and I'm not sure mall phone repair stores have access to something that I don't, so I'd even consider having Apple do the repairs over them if the price difference weren't so great. But they charge so much that at times I'd be better off ordering a used phone than paying for their repairs.


Replacing a family member's 6s battery with an iFixit one resulted in virtually no improved battery life. It would've been more beneficial to just have Apple replace it, sadly. If it gets too expensive, I'll probably still try it and with such price hikes I won't recommend battery changes as I would before, but the end result will just be that people will delay or not replace batteries at all, probably until when they want to get a new device anyway (which Apple hopes to promote by doing this).


I've done my fair share of battery replacements using batteries from Amazon. It was always very cheap and not really difficult, but anecdotally the battery quality almost always turned out to be abysmal. I've had so many of them puff up with hydrogen gas after a year or two or so. Online I read that the only good third-party batteries available in my region are those sold by iFixit.

Given the price difference of iFixit products with Apple Store servicing, it really doesn't make sense to me considering the opportunity cost of doing the repair myself (i.e. potentially breaking the device and being out more money). Plus, I totally wouldn't trust the IP rating of my device after a self-repair, so that's a capability of the device which gets virtually "lost".

Put simply, I will be using the official service when the price of the repair isn't completely outrageous.


I’m perfectly happy doing it myself, but to trust that battery, which source I cannot verify, isn’t going to go all Note 7 on me - that’s another thing entirely. 

It’s the same issue with all the third party stores. 

I didn’t use to care about this. “A battery is a battery”, but apparently it wasn’t. 

Another thing we’re paying for is accountability. If they change it and screw up I get a new phone. If I change it and screw up I get to pay for a new phone. 

I’m perfectly happy to work on my own stuff. Have done so all my life, but I do pay someone to do the battery swap on an iPhone. 

If I could simply buy the battery and replacement gaskets from Apple I’d probably do that, but since you can’t…


In my case it was better than the battery still in it, but that's because that battery was basically dead, and this one wasn't.


I had the same issue. Was pretty disappointed.


Seriously? How bad was it


Same experience with a 6s battery.


No, it won’t. For any iPhone models X and down there will be no noticeable difference (except battery life may not be as good as originals, depending on the quality of the part). For models XS and above you will receive an ‘unknown part’ warning in settings and be unable to see your battery health’ IF you just get a battery swap. This can be avoided by paying slightly more to get a repair tech to swap the battery’s BMS board in which case it will still act as new. Either way, there will be no ‘malfunctions’.


My dad has replaced batteries in an older iPhone of his and a couple others, no issues/malfunctions at all.


Best of luck, the adhesive keeping the iPhone 11 battery in place is difficult to work with from my experience.


Tell me about it! The sad (or good) news is if you jumped companies it may actually do… loyalty doesn’t really pay anymore…


I was about to say, poor things, they're doing it so tough nowadays.


For apple, they just replace the device for iPads, they don’t open it up.


How much does that battery cost on iFixit?


Lol I don’t think anyone on this earth but Apple would want such a computer so I think it’s fair in this case


All I am waiting is for USB C on an iPhone.

If that happens, I may move to iOS full time as a personal device.

That is the way to go imo, I have an 8 currently and planning to get a 14 now, although the 8 will still go for another 1-2 years personally I think its time to upgrade as it’s starting to show its age, I did replace the battery a year ago and it does give a lot more life to the phone.


I got the 12 pro


The idea behind for-profit capitalism is that profits are NEVER ENOUGH. That’s the system. Why do people vilify for-profit enterprise for being for-profit? They’ll keep making money as long as demand demands it. Prices will go up as costs and demand do. Prices come down as the result only of oversupply or under-demand.

If you want fairness in capitalism, a piece of it for yourself, invest! If you don’t like the system, domicile in another country that works on another economic system.


> The downside of capitalism

Ahh yes, there is famously only one


you could just not buy it thanks to capitalism


The M1 Air is three years old and they have never lowered the price on their store. Instead, they launched the M2 Air for $200 higher. That IS a price hike. They did the same with the base iPad; 10th Gen is a price hike and they still sell the 9th Gen (while also quietly hiking the price outside the US to match whatever their new exchange rate is). Same goes for the Apple watch. The new SE is a "price cut" but they also got rid of the S3 that's $50 cheaper. The third iPhone SE is a direct price hike too.

The Mac Mini and the Homepod are the only price cuts they've done because they're the less popular products.


Poor things. How do they even get by with those hundreds of billions in cash alone...


Battery life is way better on the 12P than the 4S I had. 

Battery life gets worse overtime but that length of time has dramatically expanded. My 6S barely lasted 7 hours after a couple years. My 8 is way better than both and my 12 is better than all of them.


87% on the 12 Pro Max, does seem to run down faster. I did. get a car with CarPlay so repeatedly charging my phone throughout the day.

Also my auto-correct has been abysmal.


My 11 Pro Max has been at exactly 88% for at least the last year. I don't trust that number at all anymore.


Same boat here. 11 Pro since Nov. 2019 and still at 92% health somehow.


99% on my 13 pro max. Had it for almost exactly a year.  Use it daily for 3-4 hours - mostly reddit, news sites, and a little tik tok.  If you dont watch a ton of youtube/ videos these things will last alot longer.


Don’t burr it


Not just saturated, but also plateaud. Every brand has been struggling to bring out new features that makes a worthwhile upgrade. From the X to the 14, it feels like there's 2, maybe 3 generations worth of upgrade between them. The Pixels are usually static for two generations because the latter is spent fixing bugs from the former. Samsung killed the Note and went hard on Foldables precisely because of this.


> It turns out perpetual rapid growth is impossible.

I mean it never was and anyone who believed otherwise was a literal fool or conman. This is just more greed-flation and they're hoping no one will notice.


Which is just fucked and another massive flaw in our capitalist system. It’s not enough to make the same percent of profit as you did the year before. Hell, it’s not even enough to achieve year-over year growth if that growth isn’t more than the previous year’s growth. The entire foundation of the system is broken. When profit alone is no longer the goal, instead needing more profit every year than you got the previous year, that inevitably leads to cutting costs (shittier product, lower wages, layoffs, store closures) and increasing profits (less value to the customer, price gouging, removing previously-free benefits, etc). 

Businesses have to keep hurting themselves, their employees, and their customers year after year just to kick the can down the road until they inevitably collapse under their own weight.


It was the first iPhone to be 999$ .

Apple is a hypocritical ass company that doesn’t give two fucks about our planet. The cables literally last a month, the batteries are fucking glued in with space grade adhesive, and their products are designed to be as irreparable as possible (without being obviously irreparable, they’re very good at this). 

Apple is very environmentally conscious when it saves them money e.g. less packaging, no charger with phone.


the one from wendover productions?


Check that chart over 5 years. It's significantly more expensive now than it was over the last few years.


Hmm, my iPad was not under 80%, so that’s why they wouldn’t replace?


>They don’t repair iPads, they replace them no matter what the issue is.

Good to know.

I was thinking of perhaps buying an iPad -toying w/the idea- but after reading this, it's not happening.

Not now, not ever unless Apple reverses course (or slow down at least) with what appears to me its stepped up consumer hostile actions.

you can literally go to apple.com right now and buy an iPhone 12...


I don’t understand why this matters? Who cares if they discontinue other devices? You can still buy those models anywhere


I don't own a single extra fast-charger. I sell or trade my charger with my old phone. Apple took away the chargers and raised the price of phones. They raised the prices of battery replacements and charge you more for a new fast-charger. That is way more e-waste than keeping it in the box. If they really wanted to reduce e-waste they would've supported USB-C about 5 years ago. They have flooded the market with absolutely useless lightening cables that can't be used with any other device. Stop defending this bullshit.


When they made this decision, wasn’t it a lightning to usb-c cable? Because I’d argue at least when the change was made that everyone had usb-a blocks, not near as many had usb-c blocks


I don’t have any usb c charging blocks


Not everyone has one. One of my friends got her first iphone a few days ago but had to buy a new charger too because her old one had a normal usb header, not a usb c one. PLENTY of examples like that.


Apple didn’t become a trillion dollar company by doing anything consumers could afford.

The 6S is an amazing backup phone / kids phone. Instead of paying 100’s for a new phone when the only issue is the battery, it would have been nice to pay only $49 to the original manufacturer to replace the battery.


IIRC it used to be $69, lowered to $29 during batterygate, then settled at $49 in 2019


oh those sneaky bastards!!!


Not really? Everything had gone up and battery replacements haven’t really increased for years


There’s no reason for one of the worlds richest companies to charge anything for a Pixel phone yet they still do

My MacBook Pro's Touch Bar was going out and causing a kernel panic, I'd have to restart it 100 times to get lucky enough to have the Touch Bar come on, then I couldn't restart it or I'd have to try 100 more times to get lucky again. I could buy the part through ifixit for $50 but it seemed like a pretty intense fix :/. Apple wanted 651 dollars to repair it. I bought a M1 MacBook Air instead. I love this new Air but that MacBook Pro was in pristine condition other than the Touch Bar, feels bad :(


“It was cheaper than going to Apple, but I fucked it up every single time and had to buy more parts to fix what I fucked up.”

How in the world is this cheaper than just getting it done right the first time? A battery replacement is $70. If they fuck it up you get a new phone. A screen replacement is $150, that is guaranteed to work. I buy AppleCare plus for all my stuff now, so a battery or screen repair is $29. It costs me $12 a month.


Battery replacement has at least been fairly cheap since “battery gate”.

And by that I mean “fairly cheap” by Apple standards.


Take the cost of a do-it-yourself part, calculate the difference between that and the cost of getting Apple to do it. The question is, is that remaining cost worth it to remove all that hassle and stress of repairing it yourself? For me, the additional $20-40 is a very reasonable price to pay for official parts, getting someone trained to do it and cover the costs should anything go wrong.


I believe the camera in a 6S+ is like $70 USD + tax. So depending on how many parts you replaced or ordered, it probably would have been less of a headache to go to apple.


It lasts MAYBE 15-20 minutes.


I get less than hour of battery life on a new battery from iFixit.


Does it retain the same level of waterproofing as having Apple do the swap ?


Ah, makes sense. Even more reason to do it myself.


25€. Not sure about the quality, though I would trust that site more than some random eBay seller.


This was bound to happen with the switch to Apple silicon and anyone around for the switch from PowerPC to Intel saw the exact same things. Essentially overnight PowerPC Macs became worthless.


Just depends on what level of risk a person is willing to accept.


>	although the 8 will still go for another 1-2 years

Actually, I’m pretty sure the [8 will not be getting iOS 17](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/iphone/iphe3fa5df43/ios).  The 7 wasn’t compatible with iOS 16.

So yeah, it might be time to upgrade when the 15 arrives.


Still a fantastic phone.

Just no

Why can't investors learn to measure company success by metrics other than profit? What happens when company just doesn't have where to grow? Now what aplle does is increase the prices because they face this situation, but then what will happen when they reach situation where profits are not increasing anymore at all?


Indeed I could.

But at least for me personally, it’s still worth it to pay to replace the battery and double the useful operating life, versus buy another phone to get the same three years of useful operating life.

So that’s what I did with my 11 Pro. I luckily got in before the price hike, so even better.


You think not lowering the price of the M1 Air is bad?

In Europe they **increased** the price of the 2y old M1 air by €100 when the M2 came out


Yup, my “bad” 12 pro probably lasts about as long as my 6s did brand new.

I reach for the charger a lot more but I’ll easily make it to October and then probably get 4 years out of my 15 Pro. (And probably just invest in a battery replacement at the 2 year mark.)


Mine is at 84%… I charge it every night and sometimes afternoons if I’ve used it a lot:..


Same here, 88% for as long as I can remember.


My 11 pro still shows 99, it showed 100 for like 1.5 years, I even thought that meter is broken at one point.


Guess that’s my problem. I constantly use it for YouTube, IG with heavy data and video usage. Use the camera for video quite a bit too


100% true. If you iterate and improve something, you get diminishing returns every time.


I think there are features that make people buy new phones, such as improved battery life (S23) or bigger camera sensors and periscope camera lenses.

But besides that for the average user there's just nothing. A few years ago it was high refresh rate where everyone can notice the benefit, but that's been here for a while now.


But but but the Static Island was the greatest update ever!   Lmao.  Apple updates are getting more gimmicky by the year.  The only reason I upgraded was to get 120hz screen (and it was worth it, helps with battery too)


I mean, People keep saying this but look how much stock markets and actual productivity have grown. If there’s a ceiling (besides the obvious social and environmental issues), we’re far from hitting it.


>	One of the main reasons people upgrade their devices is because the batteries in them have degraded to the point where they have to be replaced and the cost / benefit analysis is in favour of just outright buying a new device instead of replacing the batteries 

I never understood this reasoning.

It cost me about $75 USD tax and all to replace the battery on my 11 Pro this past February. If I’d waited until the price hike, it would have probably still been less than $100.

If I had upgraded, a 14 Pro at 256 GB would be $1100, less the $230 my 256 GB 11 Pro would trade for. So that’s $870. Over $900 with taxes.

$900 versus $100. What kind of math are the other guys doing?


> They’re pretending to be environmentally responsible by not giving you a free charger when you purchase a new phone.

Except multiple third party studies have shown that just Apple's savings on shipping alone have significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the iPhone. Even accounting for the additional chargers that people buy, it was a great move purely looking at carbon emissions


Oh ok, so nothing then.


This charger thing is so ridiculously tired.

Do YOU need another charger in the box? I don’t, my wife doesn’t, most everyone I know already has more than one charger.

Do we seriously need another one for free that we throw in a drawer or directly into the trash?

Is it the world’s best solution? No, but it’s also just not that big of a deal and people need to get over it a little.

> The cables literally last a month

You aren't using literally correctly. My phone is happily charging on its 4-year old cable.

>  the batteries are fucking glued in with space grade adhesive

The batteries are affixed with pull tabs, which you pull to release the battery from the enclosure

> and their products are designed to be as irreparable as possible

The iPhone 14 was literally redesigned internally to be more repairable, and iFixit was impressed and gave them a great repairability score, and wrote a whole article about how the rest of the industry should follow Apple's lead

Try doing some research


The cables are fine if you’re not treating them like shit. Every lightning cable I’ve gotten since the iPhone 6s is still kicking around my house working just fine. 

The only one that’s failed was the one from my iPhone 6, and that was from an out of town guest borrowing it and picking their phone up repeatedly by the cable for a week.


This still doesn’t explain what it has to do with repair pricing.


it got expensive after covid supply shock. But you are right for some reason when I checked it first it didn’t seem like price got higher over the long term. I think it will continue to drop due to tighter monetary policy.
If Apple could charge 69 in January 2022 when the price of lithium per kg was 80 why they can’t continue to do so in March 2023 when price of lithium is less than 60 and dropping.

I imagine that’ll be why yeah. They should have really given you some next steps though, like restoring the device or recommending you monitor how you use it to isolate any potential app or usage issues that are causing battery drain.


They’ve never repaired iPads by the way, they’ve always replaced them. So this isn’t necessarily a new thing, unless you’re talking about the other things they’ve started doing since like serializing the parts to computers and phones.


"We won't give you a new iPad if there's nothing wrong with your old one"

WOW user hostile, much????


Try buying a 13 Pro, tell me how that goes.


They say they care about the environment, and then stop selling perfectly good phones when incrementally improved phones come out. If they gave a shit about the environment they wouldn’t feel the need to mine the raw materials, use ridiculous amounts of water, and release tons of carbon into the atmosphere during the manufacturing process to release four phones a year that are marginally better than the ones they’re replacing.

That’s why it matters.


You sold your charger and now you’re upset you don’t have a charger? That seems short sighted.


Yep, when they ditched a power brick they simultaneously changed a cable from USB-A to USB-C. At the moment I was upgrading from iPhone X to 12, so I had no USB-C power brick so cable in the box was totally useless and was giving out a WTF vibes for me.  


And now, when they will change a port on a phone to usb-c this cable will be useless because of a Lightning on the other end of it.  How is it related to ecology - I still don't know.


iPhone shipments peaked in 2015.  The (relatively small) number of *new* iPhone users is divided into two categories;  people who've never owned a cell phone and are getting an brand new iPhone as their first phone (uncommon, at this point), or people switching from Android.   
     
If you're switching from Android, chances are your phone charged via USB-C.  That said, I don't really know how many modern recent phones ship with USB-A charging bricks.  Maybe more do that I give credit for.
   
And if you're upgrading from an iPhone, you already have the cable and brick, but now you have the cord you can use with any Mac too.   
   
TL;DR:  I think the USB-C to Lightning cable is aimed at Android converts.


That's very true, but all the same: most people genuinely don't care. It would not be a selling point because the overwhelming majority of users don't care to carry spare batteries around with them. They charge their phones at night and if the battery lasts all day there is zero functional difference between swappable and non-swappable. 

Even if 10 million Redditors all desperately want that, it's still a small minority of users. 

I would certainly *prefer* if that were an option, all else being equal. But that's the other thing: all else is not equal. Making a battery easily swappable comes with a host of design compromises. It's not "free" in the design sense. You have to give something up in other areas to enable that. Chief among them being battery life and product size, because either your battery will get smaller or the phone will get larger. And battery life is, for most smartphone OEMS, the absolute #1 metric. Few things drive smartphone designs more than battery life. Features get added or nixed solely on account of how much they impact battery life. If battery capacity drops 5% - or even 1% - for *all* users, with the upside that 1% of your users will be over the moon that they can now carry spare batteries, that's a losing trade in the eyes of any of the current crop of smartphone OEMs.


Really? You are going to compare a battery replacement charge on an old outdated phone to the charge for a brand new product? 

Using the *reductio ad absurdum* tactic only works with comparable examples.


That’s exactly how in December 2021, when for $50 I was replacing the battery in an old iPhone 7, they broke the home button. A few days later I had a like new iPhone 7 to replace my well worn one.


I don't trust myself to be able to get the thing back together as good as it was in the first place. I've done several repairs/upgrades on laptops where the parts aren't easily accessible and you basically have halfway disassemble the entire thing. There would be gaps that weren't there before, things would be loose that weren't before, things would creak and make noises that didn't before etc. Gave up on doing any more of that.


Well the screen I ordered was ~$20, and the battery was $25 from iFixit, so that's under $70, and considering I didn't live anywhere near an Apple store, I'd either have to ship my phone away (no phone at all for some time) or drive at least an hour (adding even more to the cost with gas and wear and tear on the vehicle.)  

In any case, while I don't recall what Apple was charging for a camera replacement at the time, it was very high. I can't find the cost of what it was for the 6S Plus, but [according to Apple Insider it's $449 to replace the iPhone 13 camera](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/27/apples-self-repair-program-vs-genius-bar-what-it-costs-to-fix-an-iphone-13#replacing-the-iphone-13-camera), versus $117.04 to do it yourself, assuming you don't already have a screw kit. That's 3.83x more expensive to get it done at Apple vs doing it yourself.


It isn't just cheap by Apple standards. 

Even with this price increase, Apple battery replacements are actually still cheaper than many other brands and it's quite clear the people in this thread don't realize this. 

As a Pixel user, if I wanted to replace a battery in a Pixel 5 at Google's authorized repair partner who happens to be Ubreakifix, it costs $130 USD. Apple now charges $99 USD for a battery replacement in an iPhone 14 Pro Max.


$70 is the cost for battery replacement for a 6S Plus. I don't recall the exact price Apple said it'd cost, but the camera replacement was definitely more than $70. I can't find the cost of what it is for the 6S Plus, but [according to Apple Insider it's $449 to replace the iPhone 13 camera, versus $117.04 to do it yourself](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/04/27/apples-self-repair-program-vs-genius-bar-what-it-costs-to-fix-an-iphone-13#replacing-the-iphone-13-camera), assuming you don't already have a screw kit. That's 3.83x more expensive to get it done at Apple vs doing it yourself.


I’m a repair shop owner, and my answer to this is…it depends. In my experience it will never be exactly the same, but it will be close enough, depending on where you get it changed. 

It is customary to replace the water proof adhesive under the display, but many shops do not and just reuse the old stuff, which is completely unacceptable. Also, aftermarket display adhesive is slightly weaker than the apple ones, especially on the 12, 13 and 14 series. But in general, it’s close enough provided it’s replaced and done carefully/competently.


That's very good actually, I'd totally replace it myself given the price, especially considering iPads don't have any water proofing to lose anyway.


I know 16 is last for 8, I mean it will still be practically usable for 1-2 years after that without updates too.


Demonstrate another system with success at societal scale. Not theoretical. I’ll wait.


>Why can't investors learn to measure company success by metrics other than profit

They can! Many privately-owned companies do look at other things. The problem is that for publicly-traded companies, you're not going to get the millions of owners (shareholders) to agree on a common framework. The only thing they can agree on is that they want the share price to go up, so that's what companies do.


How do you reward investment besides profit?? Other things feel good but wealthy people don’t blow money on good feelings… There MUST be returns.


Neat.


Thats a Tim Crook move right there.


Mine recently dropped from 98% to 89% in a few weeks after being “stuck” high for way longer than I had expected. I suspect it’s just a measurement or calibration issue and it finally “caught up” with the actual value.


Upgrading the battery on the old one is part of the sunk cost; you do not get higher resale value by spending on that. If your device can be sold for $300 and you pay $95 to replace the battery, then you upgrade two years from now and that device dropped to $150, you lost $245 more.


The problem is that the "carbon footprint of the iPhone" is insignificant. Food production, transportation (of humans, food, large items, etc), heating and cooling, and manufacturing of large items (such as cars) are the big items. A tiny device you only buy every few years is really insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  

Just like their elimination of plastic in their packaging. A gram of plastic wrapping a year doesn't make any difference. It's a drop in the ocean compared to things like food packaging that people buy and throw away on a daily basis. It's just a symbolic gesture.

Very little is unrepairable.


1. Anecdotal. I can counter by saying my household plows through genuine Apple lightning cables. Typical redditor smugness by implying that I’m not using a cable correctly.

2. Only in the phones, and anyone who repairs them on a regular basis will tell you that the pull tabs have an extremely high failure rate. They simply don’t work well, even when heated. To remove the battery on a Mac you need a special chemical squirted in behind the battery to weaken the glue.

3. The regular iPhone 14 is more repairable, not the Pro and Max models. So, that’s one model that ifixit has commended after years and years of repair issues. Let’s not forget their work against the right to repair movement.

I actually spent 8-years owning a business that refurbished Apple products, many of them at the board level.


Until recently, the Mac batteries were hard-glued in. I believe they switched to adhesive pull tabs on the M series MacBook Airs and Pros. But my 2019, for example, you either take it to apple for a top case replacement to just replace the battery; or you use solvent and pry out the battery and hope you don’t cause a fire. 

Also the iPhone 14 is more repairable, but not the 14 Pros.


The cost of metals and therefore the cost of Li-ion batteries are rising.


Not an expert but I imagine the price of battery replacement cannot be reduced down to just one thing. You also have efficiency in manufacturing which will tend to bring the price down over time. But of course we had inflation running very high this year which will drive up labor costs. At the scale Apple is operating at, the salvage value of the old batteries they’re taking in (minus recycling costs or however that’s managed) is likely also significant. Apple is going to do their best to absorb all these costs to stabilize the price and not raise it in response to short term pain and instead wait until long term trends make it obvious that an increase is unavoidable.


Yes, but Apple has its profit margins and simply does not budge on them. They *never* absorb the costs.


tell me where you clarified that it only applied to one specific model.


>	Yep, when they ditched a power brick they simultaneously changed a cable from USB-A to USB-C.

No. iPhone 11 (pro, at least) shipped with a USB C charger.


Thank the EU for the change to USB C.


>TL;DR: I think the USB-C to Lightning cable is aimed at Android converts

or maybe it's because their laptops are using usb c only? i don't think android users really care for lightning to usb c, they care for iphones with usb c (usb c to usb c/usb c to usb a)


I mean your issue is with the value of the company, guessing you’re expecting them to just take the loss of inflation and never put prices up?


Though the price of some repairs are not on apples repair website estimator, prices apple offers in store are as follows for the specific ones you’ve mentioned:

iPhone 6s Plus rear camera: $59 (not $70, so yes I was wrong)

iPhone 13 camera (non-pro): $169

iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max: $199

These prices are USD and do not include tax. Labor for iPhone repair is apart of the part cost.

If you want more I can price out more parts for you, but the few component replacements apple does perform are not outrageous as everyone implies in this thread.


Yeah, I will go that route actually. This thing is more than sufficient for Lightroom mobile, viewing pictures and such, so I have no need to upgrade to a newer device.


>	practically usable for 1-2 years

Yes. Correct. Possibly longer as far as receive critical security updates. I think fairly recently patched iOS 12 for something.

(My personal threshold is when I can’t transition to the next iOS full version.)

How do you think we got to this point?

You act like people saying “this world could be better” is wrong.

We would not have the decadence, success and freedoms we have currently were it not for people trying to push boundaries and make the world a better place.

Then people like you come along and say “no, no progress allowed. The system we have is the best humanity can ever do”

How about you put that energy towards working with people instead of shutting them down?


Share price must increase as that’s the way investors are rewarded. There are no alternatives. Investment isn’t just a hobby or a power play. It’s about returns!


I can't say that mine holds charge badly, but I noticed that it often hangs on the same percentage, like 84, for a very long time and then rapidly drops 5 percentage points at once. 

Maybe the battery in a worse condition than I think, but again, it holds the charge as usual.


Edit: not sure if you’re saying that’s *your* reasoning or the reasoning of hypothetical “other guy” I mentioned… apologies if it’s the latter.

>	you do not get higher resale value by spending on that.

And I also don’t have to put as much money into having an iPhone *over time*

So I bought the the 11 Pro (256 GB)for $1100 when it came out in 2019. (We’ll ignore tax for a implicitly.) So I’ve had it for about 2.5 years and have now added the $70 (again, before tax and I got it in before the price increase). So I’ve put $1170 into two and half years of ownership. And if I take “won’t get the new iOS” as my threshold for replacing it, I should be good until Fall 2025.

Fall of 2025 would mean that I’ve put $1170 into the previous six years of having an iPhone. Which is $195 per year.

If I had bought a 256 GB 14 Pro instead of replacing the battery. It would have been another $1100 less my $230 trade-in, so $870. So by Fall of 2025, I’ve invested $1110 plus $870 into iPhone ownership for a total of $1980 which would be $328 per year until the same “six years of iPhone” point because I bought a new iPhone in 2023 instead of replacing the battery. And actually the time to do it would’ve been when they released in 2022 and my 11 Pro was worth $250.

I’m going to assume I get *no trade-in value* in 2025. I buy a new 256 GB Pro for $1200 (assuming the raise price by that point). I have to replace the battery at three years for $110 (again assuming a price increase from the current $90) And I keep it it’s full update lifespan until 2031. Over a 12 year period, I’ve spent $1170 and $1200 and $110 for a total of $2410 at $200 per year average.

Following ~~your~~ the “other guy”  logic of replacing, I would have bought the 11 Pro in 2019, a 14 Pro in 2022, a 15 Pro in 2025, and a 16 Pro in 2028. So that’s at least $4400 over the same 12 year period, or $366 per year.


I mean, Apple can only control Apple. They've already made their corporate offices carbon neutral. They're working to make their entire supply chain carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And they're targeting a "closed loop" supply chain, where zero new materials are mined or harvested to create any products.

One person's individual product doesn't mean a ton in the grand scheme of things. But Apple literally sells billions of devices. It adds up.


Just because the phone is small doesn't mean the carbon footprint is insignificant. 

There are thousands of parts that go into these phones, some of the processes used are - by necessity - very energy and labor intensive. A processor or 512GB memory chip has a vastly greater carbon footprint than like...a cardboard box, even though it's much smaller.

>	What they mean is that if the battery replacements are expensive, then people will be less incentivized to just have their old phones fixed as opposed to throwing those dead battery phones in the trash and buying a new phone. Thus contributing more e waste.

“Damn this battery is $99? Guess I’d be better off spending $800 on a new phone then.” This makes no sense, and I don’t get why people are blaming Apple for people making a decision like this. Replacing the battery will always be cheaper than buying a new phone.


> if the battery replacements are expensive, then people will be less incentivized to just have their old phones fixed as opposed to throwing those dead battery phones in the trash and buying a new phone.

Battery replacement is nowhere near as expensive as purchasing a new device.


Yes, that’s why the price has gone up, but what does that have to do with the environment or cables?


HAHA sure thing buddy. What about the 12 Pro? Is it still kicking around? Or the 11 Pro? Or were all of those phones also discontinued after a year?


While this is 100% true, how many people do you think bought a 11P and then immediately upgraded when the 12 or even 13 came out?  
It was a sucky thing to do of apple, they pretty much just put a price tag of 20$ on fast charging (having to buy the brick; a quality one will always be 15-20 not necessarily apple; anker nano is great btw). Everyone who used the brick they still had, had to keep charging at 5W


I’m not saying they shouldn’t raise prices due to inflation on nearly everything that they have (new products, services, certain repair fees, etc). But at a certain point, there are just some things that Apple doesn’t really need to adjust their price for. Especially the $49/battery replacement fee for older phones. And especially raise it $20! That’s just crazy. That’s just taking advantage of customers and blaming it on inflation. I believe that even at $49, Apple would definitely not be taking a loss in this case. Except that is one less new phone that a person might buy for just replacing the battery on their old phone.


For sure. I reckon iFixit is one of the better ones in terms of reliability, although as always with third-party replacement part vendors, YMMV. Given the savings, I'd take my chances.


Yup, actually there are a lot of things I can’t get feature wise even though I have ios 16 due to hardware limitations, so I guess its time I upgrade now to a 14, then no worries for the next 5-6 years lmao


Has anyone offered something better? Everything else people have tried thus far has not been so prosperous.


Depends what one uses the phone for. For many it’s literally just a texting device. 

For power users the device can be used for many more things and having the better internals makes the extra $14 a month (based on your math) worth it. 

That being said, I’m in your camp. Sticking with an older model for a while simply because I don’t need to upgrade. Sure, my battery is at 85% but I work from home. It can be on a charger whenever I need it to.


Very few people want to replace the battery on a 4+ year old phone instead of buying the new one that's being marketed to you as being the newest shiniest thing, by that time people already say "fuck it why not buy a new one", that's part of Apple's good marketing.


Most people aren’t buying their phones outright though.

I’d imagine it’s usually a scenario of someone being near the end of their 2 year financing plan, and deciding to just finance a new phone for the same 50-60$ a month instead of spending whatever it is now to just replace the battery on the 2 year old phone.


Actually the cost of metals is not rising. It's actually falling. It went up during COVID but it's falling back down at a very steep rate. Just 30 days ago the price per KG was $75 and it's down to $55. There may of course be other reasons but metal cost is definitely not a legitimate one. 

https://www.dailymetalprice.com/metalpricecharts.php?c=li&u=kg&d=60


sure thing kiddo you really got me there.


It’s been $49 for years. Raising it by 20 is about right for inflation plus extra costs elsewhere

You can recycle phones?


Yeah. I’m probably going to end up getting a 15, but in theory my threshold is end of regular updates. Lol


The point is, we wouldn’t find out without them offering *something*, can’t know if it’s better or worse until it exists.


And honestly, I am more than likely going to get a 15 Pro. I wanted a 14 Pro but I decided to be fiscally responsible just a little bit longer. Lol


>	having the better internals makes the extra $14 a month

And if you’re in a location where they offer that in-house 0% interest 24 installment payment plan… it does get mighty tempting to just upgrade everybody two to three years.

Most people aren’t going to blink at what amounts to a $15 “subscription” plan.


Sure, but no matter how you slice it up, 36 monthly payments of $28 is around $1000 which is much more money than a single payment $89.


Lol, it’s falling now, yeah, but what about over the last five to ten years? It’s still significantly higher (about 200% higher) than it’s ever been, even with a quick drop in the last 30 days. This is in addition to the demand for lithium increasing from EV manufacturers, higher oil costs, higher nickel costs, [Zimbabwe banning the export of raw lithium](https://qz.com/why-zimbabwe-has-banned-the-export-of-raw-lithium-1849918099). There’s always more than one factor. But material costs is absolutely one of them.


Were they discontinued after a year?

Edit: this is apparently too difficult a question to answer. I’ll answer it here then: Yes. Yes they were.


I wanted to wait for 15, but at this point anything is a big upgrade from 8 so might as well get one right now, I’m not too much hung up on getting the latest features lmao I’ve used the 8 for so long so.


You’re absolutely right and I fully agree with you. 

I’m just saying that at least for the people around me, the type that finances their phone and pays outrageous monthly rates instead of buying outright and saving on monthly plans are unfortunately usually the same people that would rather just continue paying the same amount monthly and refinance a new phone instead of shelling out a 1 time payment of just under $100 upfront to replace the battery.

Getting a little off topic here but I have a buddy that had I believe around 1 year left on their financing plan, and owed about $300 bucks. Their plan was nearly $100 a month, and there was a promotion for a $30 month plan which had 2x as much data, but it was BYOP only. 

He could have saved over $800 on his plan over the course of the next year if he just paid the $300 to get out of his financing agreement (so net $500 savings for the same phone, better plan) and even though he did have the funds to pay it off, he just didn’t want to because he literally couldn’t understand how it would be possible despite me trying to help him. 

There’s just no explaining to some people. They’re too used to paying monthly that it doesn’t really make a difference anymore :/


>	at this point anything is a big upgrade from 8

Very true. You thinking 14 or 14 Pro?


That’s just so crazy to me! I’m always reticent when it comes to subscriptions or financing. If I have a choice to pay for something outright or pay an ongoing fee, it takes a lot of convincing for me to go with the latter. I saved up and purchased my current car paid in full. I got rid of cable a couple decades ago, and don’t pay for music or movie streaming services in favor of purchasing my own music / movies. And I only pay ongoing fees for software and services when *absolutely* necessary – and even with that at a minimum I still **hate** it.


>The research firm said the iPad Pro was the top-selling tablet in the category known as detachables.

More like attachables, the keyboard isn't included in either lol 


The iPad Pro is a giant tablet that runs iOS while the Surface is an actual PC that runs full version desktop software. Different products for different needs. As similar as they appear they are quite different.


Considering how much of the tablet market Apple has over Microsoft, it's actually not that bad for Microsoft. Apple sold 2 million units while Microsoft sold 1.6 million units. Although this is just for the Ipad Pro (and not all of Apple's tablet sales), it's still doesn't seem that bad.  
  
Edit: for all those people saying "ONLY $1.6 MILLION?? THAT NUMBER SUCKS" how do you think the market actually works? Do you think that just because a new product is released 30 million people will go and instantly snap up that product? 


I have a Macbook pro, an iPad Mini, and iPhone. I'm firmly in the Apple ecosystem, and Apple's target demo for this thing. A client gave me one of these last month, and I was eager to try it out.  

The speakers were great, the screen was great. But basically, its simply a bigger iPad. And if all you do is use it as an iPad, in my opinion, its TOO big. There's nothing the iPad does, that this does better. What it MIGHT do better, of course, is art, thanks to the pencil, but I couldn't know, because I couldn't get my hands on one, try as I might.  

When trying it int he Apple Store, the pencil really is fantastic. It cant be overstated- this is the best stylus on the market, BY FAR. This is the stylus artists and illustrators have been waiting for. So why the hell didn't Apple make enough and ship them at a the same time? Major screw-up, if you ask me.  

And that's not the only thing Apple screwed up: at launch, there were literally no apps that took advantage of the larger screen. All they did was zoom in, or show more empty space. Why the hell does this thing only display 7 rows of icons, when my iPhone 6 can display 7? Its like some kind of sad joke. No Apple, split screen isn't enough: you should have re-designed ALL of your native apps to take better advantage of the larger screen. more toolbars, more intuitiveness, more cleverness. Why is a launch screen so crazy to think about?   

Years ago, this was Apple's big advantage- controlling the hardware and the software allowed them to jump the line and unveil a whole ecosystem of physical features and software to support it, all at once, at launch. I HATE when people toss out "this never would have happened under Steve", but after years, I find myself saying it- This never would have happened under Steve.  

The iPad Pro may very well be a revolutionary, class-defining product... next year. Right now, save your money.


I'd still get a full out Windows 10 than a giant iOS tablet. 


As a graphic artist, I really, really wanted to like the Surface Pro. The ability to run programs like Photoshop and Zbrush on a tablet with a pressure sensitive pen seemed like nirvana. However, I went to demo one at the Microsoft Store, and was disappointed by the stylus performance. The screen deformed under moderate pressure and the stylus tip point of contact seemed to have a distance from the actual cursor. I went down the block to the Apple store and demo'd the iPad Pro. The feel of the pencil is light years ahead of the Surface Pro and the Galaxy S-Pen tablet that I have (and hate, though mostly because of the software). I couldn't argue with the feeling of drawing on the iPad vs. the Surface. I hope MSFT addresses the issue of ergonomics and drawing experience, since iOS is so limiting in so many ways. I'm really curious to see where the next generation of the Surface Pro and Surface Book go, however.


I got to dick around with one of these at an Apple Store a few weeks ago. It is a fucking amazing product. So responsive. So snappy. Even the speakers are amazing. 

I can see why they're selling so well. Once it can run Logic X and I can work on my projects on the go, I really won't need a laptop anymore.


I bought an iPad Pro for my GF for Christmas. She played with one in the store and fell in love with the Apple Pencil and how natural it was to use. Both of our daughters have iPad's (an iPad Mini and an iPad Air 2) and she had been taking the Mini with her to work each day so I figured it was time for her to have her own.

I'll be honest, I've only used the original Surface Pro and that was one a friend had that I tried for maybe 20 minutes one night. Wasn't anything bad about it really. For my GF's needs, because we have 3 Mac computers, we both have iPhone's and both girls already had iPad's, it just made sense to continue with Apple products. That we are already invested in the ecosystem kept me from even really looking at a Surface. Apple has done a great job with getting people locked in, but I don't FEEL locked in, if that makes sense. I don't feel like I have to buy all Apple stuff, I have Apple stuff that I use and really enjoy, so I continue to buy more Apple stuff partly because it will work with the stuff I already have.

That said, I'm also quite pleased with the build quality of the Apple products I own. I want products that just work. There was a time when I was all about Linux and had no problems spending hours getting everything to work just right. Installing the right sound driver and the right graphics driver and even going out and buying different hardware for better compatibility. But at some point I got tired with having to muck with things. With her iPad Pro, she opened it up, signed into iCloud, and her email, messages, calendar, passwords, and everything else was there. Went to the app store, pulled up purchased items, and within a few minutes all of her apps were installed. So it's not just that it's a great device that works well and is easy to use, but it's the little things like your photos and emails and everything else just being there without having to copy stuff over. And then there's the little things like how fast it is, how well the Logitech keyboard works with it, how accurate the Apple Pencil is and how it feels like a premium item.

I have friends that tell me I'm stupid for buying Apple because a Surface can run Windows apps. I have thousands of dollars of Mac apps and a great 5k iMac that I use daily. I have $0 of Windows apps, nor do I need a tablet to replace the laptop I have. I use different devices for different purposes. And when I want to blur those lines, I use AstroPad and Duet.


 I bought my iPad pro not knowing what I would end up using it for, kind of blindly actually. Now that I've had it for a month, or use it more than any other device. It's amazing how fast this thing is 


Especially in the NFL.


That's not possible, the news media narrative has been that Apple is dying. Something must be wrong here.


But but but… people told me the iPad Pro was a flop because everyone wanted a full desktop OS, to make the tablet even more expensive, slower, and have a poor battery life.


I'm by no means a fanboy of either of these companies; but it must be a bit of a blow to Microsoft seeing this figure...

Apple is more established in this segment. Microsoft just started creating their own products and their Surface 4 hasn't launched yet-it's the Surface Pro 4 that's on sale now. Microsoft posted large growth over last year. 

It's going to be interesting. 


I'm a staunch Apple fan.  I've used Apple products exclusively for years.  But I bought a Surface.  The software I would need to use on a tablet in my line of work simply doesn't exist on iOS, so there was no way I could justify an iPad Pro over a Surface Pro, even with the iPad's superior stylus.


My Surface Pro 4 is my favorite device... but let me say something that might ruffle some feathers here and in the Surface subredddit too.   I think this whole thing, tablets re dying because fewer were bought this year than last, is so over-exaggerated.  The argument goes like this:  Surface-like devices are the wave of the future, because sales for this style of device increased "X" percent this year over last, whereas sales for the classic tablet form-factor decreased "X" percent.  Therefore tablets are dead.  Really?  Did you read the source material and see just HOW MANY TABLETS were out there, compared to sales of the iPad Pro and Surface detachables COMBINED? By many times?  We're talking a few million detachables vs. a few HUNDRED MILLION tablets last year.  Ain't nobody going broke making tablets right now, that's for sure.  If I make and sell detachable starting today....I sell two today. If I sell four next year, then this is a 100% increase.  Surely this means my device is the wave of the future, right?  Absurdity!  Do the math: At this rate, IF tablet sales keep declining at the same rate and IF detachable sales keep selling at the same rate, it would take the better part of a decade for detachable s to start outselling traditional tablets. Meaning that for a long time, most people are still going to refer a regular ol' Android tablet than anything else.


I think Apples devices are in a different class to the Surface devices. They are passively cooled, and have radically simplified and battery optimized operating system.  The Surface devices simply don't  deliver the same experience. 


Meh, the surface lineup is even more expensive than macbook pro in some configs, and also their launch is full of bugs, i know you guys gonna bash me but it is an amazing device.
But their usebase it 0.1% the size of apple userbase, nobody wants to pay apple premium in a device that does not work perfectly, so we wont be seeing high sales figures if microsoft continues to fuck things up

on a side note the non pro surface 3 is a very capable small , pen enabled, cheap high quality tablet, i think its the first very right move by Microsoft.


Except it doesn't really matter if Apple outsells the surface line.  

The market right now is split between iOS, Android, and Windows, that's how you should categorize the sales. 

And when it comes to hybrid devices the Windows sales for all tablet hybrids is substantially larger than the 2 million iPPs. Which is more telling than just comparing one of the many windows hybrid OEMs to the only iOS show in town.


I can tell you one thing - MS is screwing up enterprise royally. iPads don't cost extra for licensing, you just have to buy the tablet. At my institution MS charges 600 bucks extra on top of the Surface because there is "potential" for MS software to be installed on them under a site license, even if it isn't used. I just basically forced to buy an iPad pro even though I had previously leaned more towards a Surface Pro due to this policy. 


Side by side iOS apps are great but a lot needs to be done. I think Apple has the hardware down for the iPad pro, it just needs a lot of help with the software. 


The reactions in other subreddits are telling. :-(



How much did the biggest company in the world sell? The Pixel C?


I so wish they'd just do an OSX tablet. *sigh*


I'd like to hear from any artists who bought the Pro if it's really worth $1300.  I tried it out in the Apple store and noticed just enough lag to make it annoying, but I might be able to get used to it.  

I'm also in the process of uploading all my reference stuff I've collected over the years to iCloud but have discovered the Photos app's "optimize Mac storage" isn't exactly what it's cracked up to be, it seems to be filling up my hard drive.


We did it /r/Apple ! I made sure to buy one for the gf and for myself :D


The only keyboard I've ever found usable with a tablet is a regular Apple bluetooth keyboard, set up on a table.  Laps don't agree with tablet typing, and I hate those bulky cases.

Incidentally, I sometimes go to events with a lot of tech journalists and nearly all of them type on laptops balanced on their laps while sitting in tiny chairs.  So that use case, which I don't think is too common, probably colors their coverage.


Fun facts:

For the last four weeks, it was impossible getting your hands on the Surface Book i5/256gb, some of the dGPU models, and a few of the i7 SP4's.

It got so bad that we were down to scalping on eBay.

To miss the mark by 400,000 units for a PREMIUM WINDOWS DEVICE that barely had 2-3 weeks of actual time on shelves when you consider it being out of stock for weeks the MOMENT it went on sale, is not only impressive, but makes Apple look like the loser here.

I use a Surface Book daily at Manhattan Motorcars in NYC. It's a stupid high end dealership, where our cheapest cars would be a Boxster. My job is to photograph and upload all vehicles to the site now that I've recently started here, to fix the crap the old photographer was putting up.

Let's just say that no MacBook or iPad Pro can touch the Surface Book. Try being tethered to your Surface Book in Lightroom, having your photos instantly import and have relevant tonal/NR applied on import, and then being able to switch to clipboard mode and walk around with, I really kid you not, about 12 hours of battery at your disposal to upload and take notes on.

A few diehard Apple guys at work are now forced to use a Surface Pro 3 at work since our dealer is outfitted with Surface Docks (they independently chose the Surface over iPad). They hate that they love them, and lately, one of the salesmen who I know just got an iPad Pro can't seem to stop asking me about the Surface Book.

I edited a video of the Bugatti Veyron, 1080p 60fps, dual camera, with Warp Stabilizer, Three-Way Color Corrector, and Red Giant Looks. Handheld. Sitting inside a Lamborghini Aventador. 

Let me see the iPad Pro do that. Oh wait, it can't because no SD card slot, and God forbid you want to use a super fast external SSD too as a scratch drive while moving files from the SD card. 

I bet so many Apple fans will jump in to ask why I'm here. It's to shatter those rose tinted glasses. Microsoft has absolutely wrecked everything Apple has on sale with the Surface Book. 

BRB, going to upload a video demonstrating exactly what I'm talking about.


My question is if the iPad Pro is really going to be able to save the iPad line. Sales are still down for tablets overall TMK. It seems Apple is top dog in a dying category. Sad too: iPads have always been the most stable and reliable iOS device for me. Even my iPhones have had defects here and there (particularly my iPhone 5). In my entire history of owning iPads (which is almost as long as owning iPhones, 2011), over 5 generations owned, I've had two replacements. Not even my 15" MBPs have lasted that long. The GPU usually died within 6 months of purchase, lobo was swapped 4+ times, store opted to swap out the machine. Had 4 MBPs over the course of 4 years.

I love my Air 2. Great device.

2.0M iPads vs 1.6M Surface Pros. I honestly would have suspected a larger lead, considering MS is coming from zero. Microsoft posted an increase of 22% in revenue, and Apple posted a 24% decrease in the same period. 


[deleted]


So people actually prefer products with better quality control, premium build quality, and outstanding support and customer service? Weird.


Well duh.


That's a real shame.

I like my Retina iPad, and I love my MacBook Pro, but Surface Pro are an awesome combination. (Though; I'm eager for when they have quad core and 16-32GB memory, that's what I need for a portable workstation, and the reason I stay Mac and/or investigate other choices like Alienware/MSI/Clevo).



[deleted]


That is because you are all retarded fucks who buy anything with an apple logo on it


Considering that even Microsoft's biggest fanboy, Thurott, is lamenting the failure that Surface Pro was, it's still way too many Surfaces sold.


Uh oh, /r/Apple isn't going to like its favorite tablet (Surface Pro) losing to an iPad. It doesn't even have any usb ports!

Edit: Guys, guys... enough with the down votes! I'm sorry I forgot to mention it doesn't have a file system or an SD card reader! 


The simpler way to understand it is probably realizing that Microsoft have clients while Apple have fans.

The ones saying that iPad Pro replaced their PCs are the same that told us they replaced they with iPads in the latter years.


due to design for sure.


This is amazing considering how much the iPad Pro sucks.


People want touchscreens on their laptops, when is Apple going to do that.  Having a laptop in your lap and forced to use a track pad sucks, especially when you can flick your thumb to scroll down webpages easily and naturally


Suck it Microsoft. 

Sent from my Windows 7 laptop.


Selling the iPad Pro without bundling the attachable keyboard and pencil is like selling a MacBook Pro without a keyboard and mouse/trackpad.


I'd love to know where those firms get their estimates from.

Also the this quote doesn't make much sense:

> “With these results, it’s clear that price is not the most important feature considered when acquiring a detachable – performance is,”

Unless I'm missing something, a Surface pro with a core i7 outperforms an iPad pro.


Still don't see the allure of tablets.  Even the most basic macbook air is much more useful. It can do everything better than a tablet. And given its size, it might be more portable. 

They're glorified Netflix-watching devices. And since I can do that on my laptop, they're useless. 


All those toddlers need to upgrade their nanny machines...


I can't make a claim for either... I've used both and have unique issues with both in different ways--

That said, Apple has a lot more brand power when it comes to what people think of when they think "tablet" which I'm sure helps with sales.  Microsoft is no slouch of a brand, and they're definitely moving up in the tablet world... but there are plenty of people out there that would exchange the word "ipad" for "tablet" in a sentence.  iPad is nearly as ubiquitous as "Kleenex" for tissues.


Duh. Who has a Microsoft tablet? Hahaha poverty phone. 


Seriously, all these Tablet hybrids would be miles better if they came with the keyboard. All of the keyboards are all over $100USD with the iPad Pro, Surface, even the Pixel C


I'd be interested to see the proportion returned though. We have a surface and I am very close to returning it. Crashes, inconsistent behaviour, taking an age to wake up...you're right in that they're very different beasts but I want either device to work properly. I don't own an iPad pro and have barely used one, but I would bet that it doesn't crash, or hang or just infuriate you like a windows PC.


People should try running Photoshop on a Surface Pro. Yes, you get access to the full desktop app, but since Photoshop wasn't designed for touch, you need to use the keyboard with Photoshop on the Surface in order to use all of the shortcuts that are used. This means that one cannot even take advantage of the portability of the Surface when using one of its hallmark features (the pen) in one of the most popular programs for Windows. 

This is the type of stuff that isn't apparent on paper that people should factor in when comparing these devices. Apple's right on this one. Keep the touch OS separate from the mouse-and-keyboard tradition. Mixing them gives you hybrids that aren't good at any of the things.


Beyond that, of course the iPad Pro is going to outsell the Surface. There are dozens of excellent Windows tablets by a variety of manufacturers spreading out their sales numbers (some of which beat the Surface in power and price), while there is only one iPad Pro. I wish they had compared the total for Windows tablets, that'd be a much more meaningful statistic.


runs full desktop and sucks as a touch screen device. 


Agreed.  If the iPP was more than just a giant iPad with a pen I could be in the market.  I mean, it should be able to run both iOS and OSX, right?  Why not let you switch when you need to?


Tell this to the Surface fans. 


[deleted]


it's crazy that so many more people prefer the first way.


Given that PC is a effectively a reserved term for machines that run x86 Windows, saying that the Surface is an actual PC (as if to berate the iPad as somehow lesser) is silly. You're right of course that they're different - one runs on outdated paradigms that were designed mostly with business operations in mind, and one actually wants to be a device that people actually want to use. 


I'm surprised no one is pointing out that the iPad pro sold 2 million considering how everyone called it a pointless flop. 




Huh, it's not bad that the iPad Pro sold more than all Surface units? The iPad Pro is a niche device like the Mac Pro, there's no way it should be selling more than all of Surface. Especially with the new Surface Pros and Surface Books launching for the holidays.


That's how Microsoft usually does business. They release a new version of Windows and sales are, right out of the gate, tens of millions of copies. New Xbox? Tens of millions.

They're having a much tougher time with PC hardware.

Also I think most people that wanted a surface already bought the sp3 or earlier. Ipad pro is actually something new. 


> Do you think that just because a new product is released 30 million people will go and instantly snap up that product?

This is the company that launches new iPhones to tens of millions of preorderers and 25+ million unit launch weekends. 


sorry what's "new" about Surface Pro? hasn't it been out for 4 years?


> The iPad Pro may very well be a revolutionary, class-defining product... next year.

That's the deal here. Apple is pushing the envelope and chopping off the desktop. It's a new paradigm. Microsoft is clinging onto the past. Without chopping off the past Adobe and the like will never release full PS for tablets. Apple is hoping to sell lots of these and win ecosystem wise like they have on iPhone.


I wouldn't. I'd much prefer iOS. 

But that's why capitalism is great because we can choose!  

Competition rocks.

You say that....


I'm kinda surprised - I had heard that the surface pen was pretty comparable (from watching a couple of reviews by those in graphics).  I thought the apple pencil felt a bit better personally, but I'm no expert so I assumed the consensus was that they are about the same.


I'm not a graphic artist, but I use stylus for precision sketches like drafting plans and diagrams and lots and lots of notes in block lettering. I also write really really tiny.

I have the opposite problem. The SurfaceBook pen only draws on contact, but the default low range sensitivity is way too narrow (goes from thin lines to fat lines really quick. Custom pressure profiles can fix this issue, but it is not a big deal for me). Also, the Surface pen has bad interpolation that rounds/cuts edges/corners, which makes my small hand writing nearly unreadable. Lag wise the Surface pen is slightly behind the Apple Pencil. Post interpolation is almost unnoticeable at least.

The Apple Pencil on the other hand will start inking with the pen 0.3mm away from the screen. Its pretty annoying since I usually write really tiny and quickly in block lettering, which makes my letters look like some screwed up cursive (this issue might be isolated to my ipad pro and apple pencil). The Apple Pencil is very responsive, but at a cost. Basically the Apple Pencil will ink almost immediately, but then follow up with interpolation. Thus, I can see my ink change/dance (the interpolation 80% of the time gives better results). This also affects the hover drawing issue I'm having. Basically I'll write really fast and my letters will be all connected, but the interpolation shortly afterwards remove all the connecting lines. 

For tiny hand writing, I still find the Note 4 and 5 to perform the best in terms of accuracy. However, the wacom in the Note 4 and 5 is by far the laggiest. Also, the screen is too small for any serious work and the bundled pen is terrible.




Which surface was it? I had all those issues with my surface pro 2, which is basically gathering dust, but I heard they fixed a lot of them with the pro 3. 


ya I owned the SP2 but the SP3 was hilariously bad

only demoed the SP4 long enough to see the appalling stairstepping and immediately ordered an iPad Pro


Agreed. If budget and software is important I'd rather have the Surface, but there's no denying that the pro is much better for anything involving a stylus.


I've heard that the n-trig technology microsoft uses is more precise around the edges and is generally tailored to note taking, as opposed to drawing.
The ipad seems to be aimed at artists who draw, the surface at people who write and take notes (like students)


I'm here to defend Surface at all cost. Servers! Servers! It was the servers! ;-)


Apple is in an odd position. Nobody faults Lamborghini when they sell fewer cars than Ferrari. Nobody would claim they are failing if they had a record quarter. With Apple, unless they come up with a device that matches the initial success of the iPhone, the media will continue to claim the sky is falling. But even if/when they come up with the next great thing, there will be some other issue. They have $2B+ in cash and just posted their best quarter ever. They aren't in a position where they need to take big risks. You can look at companies who have really went off a cliff in terms of profitability like Nokia and RIM. They both were primarily one single line of products. Apple may not be taking over the world with Mac sales but it's a profitable line of products. If you were to take away all iOS devices completely, they would still be turning a profit and be able to stay in business. And to me that's the thing... I don't care if iPhone sales are flat or declining. They've sold so many over the past couple years that you know we have to be getting close to a peak. But for the sky to be falling, they would have to either losing money or on the verge of losing money. They're nowhere near that. Will they continue to have crazy growth quarter after quarter? Probably not. But as of right now, they continue to post larger and larger profits. In what universe does your best quarter ever not cause your stock to reflect your success?


Did you read the article?


It is a flop though


MS's business model requires them to give their OEM's space to compete.  They don't want the Surface to be at an operating loss, but they don't want it to dominate either because their OEM's would up and quit.

Meanwhile Apple has no OEM's.


Not really a huge blow as the iPad Pro didn't really outsell it by that huge a margin. 1.6 million to 2 million.


Microsoft is still very new to the hardware game, and 1.6million really isn't horrible. What this honestly says is that people saying consumers don't want a huge powerful tablet running a mobile OS are wrong, at least for now. 


I think after the hype died down around the Surface Book and SP4, a lot of people who were going to buy one didn't because of the reviews. The Surface Book in particular turned out to be really buggy.


I tend to think that MS is used to it at this point given that every handheld product they have ever released has been at best disappointing.  


Surface is too strongly positioned as a tablet when it really sucks to use as a tablet.  That's the fundamental problem with the device is that it's really just an ultrabook-style laptop.  What's the point if it doesn't deliver on one half of the proposed feature set?  And I mean, holy god is the display scaling still awful on Windows, too.  It's a Windows PC like any other and as such it is best used on a desk with keyboard and mouse and a big display.  


This is so true.  On paper the Surface Book seems amazing.  The iPad Pro, not so much... it seems like a bigger iPad with added complexity of a keyboard and stylus (that shouldn't be needed).

I saw them both for the first time one right after the other.  I wasn't expecting what I experienced at all.

The Surface Book was pretty much unusable as a tablet from the get go.  Detaching the keyboard requires *software* to respond to the request, which often it doesn't.  During my extended evaluation with the unit, I only used it as a tablet to see what it was like a few times... and it sucked.

The iPad Pro on the other hand really surprised me with how well the keyboard works and how incredible the Pencil is for graphics/photo work.  It's literally the best device I've ever used for editing graphics/photos because of the experience of editing the image directly as opposed to using one tool and looking somewhere else.


WOW I can't overstress this enough.... The shock of the surface pro not working as advertised drove me directly to the iPad Pro, a device that works as advertised... or more specifically as expected.


A weak argument. This is Microsoft's fourth Surface. Look at the sales numbers for Apple's fourth iPad Q1.

26 million. It's one of the reasons why iPad sales numbers have slowed. Most people I know with iPads this old or older are still using them.


I don't think tablets are dying. People aren't jumping to buy the newest ones. I have an iPad 4 and an iPad Mini 2 which do what I need them to do. So why buy the "latest and greatest" when the oldest still works like a champ? 


Yes. You don't have to care for backups, or virus, drivers, apps update themselves, updates are much simpler, etc. etc. etc.


What's your opinion of the Surface Book?  That looked fantastic to me, and wish apple would try something like it.  I *really* want a MBP and an iPad pro combined, it would be incredibly convenient. 


"Let's split this in a random way so Apple loses"


What institution? And what licensing model see you guys setup with? 

The Surface is a full blown independent machine, it can leverage an existing Enterprise MAK/KMS license, it can use O365, what licenses are you talking about? 


[deleted]


Out of curiosity, what would you like Apple to do with software? Are you someone who wants OS X apps on the iPad? I go back and forth on that. My GF has Word and Excel on her iPad Pro and they work great. Photoshop she uses via AstroPad and it works surprisingly well.  And apps that she really likes such as Chunky comic reader, SparkMail, and so on have been getting updated for iPad Pro. At the end of the day I think it's great at what it does. Apple never intended it to replace laptops like a Surface is supposed to do. In my opinion they took aim at one particular size of Wacom Cintiq, did a great job at coming close to if not matching it, while also offering a great tablet. Would it be cool if you could load up OS X apps as well? Sure. I think with the power it has that might work pretty well, but then again, how well would Photoshop run? Or the desktop version of Office? There's a reason I have 32Gb of memory in my iMac... although to be honest that's partly because I need to run Windows via Parallels for a couple classes at school.


I don't think Microsoft really intend for the Surface lines to be in everyone's hands. They want just enough success that all the OEMs get competitively jealous and enter the race to the bottom while Microsoft sits back and collects licensing fees without the worry of physical distribution and failed hardware returns.

Nice in theory. Making Billions selling trivially clone-able OS software and getting 30% markup to everything that passes through the store. Indeed despite the high price of the Surface line Microsoft is possibly even loss leading towards that goal of essentially free money if the OEMs can create a compelling hardware market.

But it's all let down by Microsoft's software. Endless bugs and firmware updates that achieve little. An immature but essential (in a touch context) Windows RunTime that doesn't mesh well with Windows classic. A store that would drive uptake that is utter rubbishy.

The free money isn't going to come any time soon, if at all. Microsoft is absolutely dominated in the portable handheld market when it comes to OS maturity and marketplaces by both Google and Apple, and Apple in particular has hardware as their forte with not a hint of loss leading.

If Microsoft drops the portable hardware aspect then it will have no cards left besides a declining desktop market. Their only hope in the consumer space is the OEMs saturating the market like happened with desktop PCs and I just don't see that happening while Microsoft does so poorly on their end of the deal.


> My question is if the iPad Pro is really going to be able to save the iPad line. Sales are still down for tablets overall TMK. It seems Apple is top dog in a dying category.

You're statement seems to ignore that iPad sales generate 16M unit sales per year.  Dropping or not, it is still a *fucking huge* chunk of money.  It's not *dying*.  It's shrinking.  And Apple is the only one making any money selling tablets.  A fuck-ton of money.


I think we need another year of data to really see the future of the iPad. Right now, it's on a downward slide, but we have to remember that people don't replace iPads like they do phones. Many people hang on to them for 3+ years. There's also a lot to be said about the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus taking some of those sales due to larger screens. And of course the new MacBook and even the rMBP 13".

All in all, the iPad is getting attacked from all sides by its own brothers and sisters, not to mention other tablets like the Surface (though, admittedly those other competitors aren't selling much). Combine that with a slow replacement cycle for users, and the fairly terrible economy and you've got a tough sell.

I honestly think people are mostly happy using a slightly large phone for everything. And when they want a bigger screen, it'll be a TV, a desktop, or a laptop still. 


I think we need to wait for the air 3 before we say it's dying. Apple is the biggest tablet maker and they haven't released their 'normal' iPad forever. 


> My question is if the iPad Pro is really going to be able to save the iPad line.

Is anyone expecting it to? It's the most expensive iPad by far, which means it is *not* the one most are going to buy, which means it should not be expected to "save the iPad line."

And while this is of course just a personal anecdote, I still don't know anyone with an iPad Pro, and I switched from an old iPad 2 to an iPad Mini 2 because I love the more compact size. I went smaller, not bigger.

I think the iPad Pro is like the new MacBook: A product seemingly designed to help Apple figure out which way consumers want to go, since the iPad Pro is getting close to being a laptop and the MacBook has a lot of design choices in common with an iPad.


Wow you're either unlucky or brutal to your machines \^\^.  I've had my MBP for almost 4 years now, and it's still happily ticking (battery admittedly sad though), even after I kept it at 90C for 2 weeks straight running calculations for my PhD a couple of years ago.


I think Apple really needs to either start developing desktop class programs themselves or make a deal with some other major companies to do it for them. The OS in iPad Pro is actually quite proper, but there is just no way for me to use it for actual work.

I really thought that I could at least use it for some fast photo editing and organising, until I realised the hard way that none of Adobe's apps support RAW whatsoever, making them essentially useless.

The hardware is great and the OS is passable, but there is very little to no software beyond that to actually make it a "Pro" device.


Is it really a category that is going away or is it more an issue of tablets lasting for quite a long time? My family has an iPad Mini, an iPad Air 2, and recently an iPad Pro. My plan is when the next iPad Pro comes out, my GF will get that, my oldest daughter will get the current iPad Pro, and my youngest will get the iPad Air 2. We'll then get rid of the mini. We have three people in the family using iPad's and all three are quite happy. We've had the Mini since a couple weeks after it was released (took that long to be able to find one to buy). I'm invested in the iPad line but I don't need to upgrade my two older devices because there is no upgrade for the iPad Air 2 as of yet, and the Mini is still going strong. It does everything my 5 year old wants to do. And it's not like my 9 year old is maxing out the iPad Air 2 and wishing it was faster or did anything else.

With iPhones's we upgrade every year. With tablets we don't need to. My rMBP is 3 years old and I would buy a new one tomorrow if I had a reason to. Right now it's plenty fast and does everything I ask of it. After 3 years I still have 84% battery capacity so I can't even use crap battery life as a justification to myself to buy a new one.

I think iPad sales will taper off because a lot of people who want one, have one, and have no reason to upgraded within the first 2 or 3 years.


Not sure how tablets are a "dying category" so much as people's upgrade cycles are becoming less and less since iPads last so damn long. There are people with an iPad 2 that still don't want to upgrade. Does that mean they don't like tablets? No. Just that since it's still usable, they're not going out to buy another one. YET. The category will always exist (until some point we have computer chips in our brains or something) the sales numbers the first few years shot so high because 1) so many people didn't have one and wanted one and 2) There were a lot of useful features in the coming versions. Retina screens, more ram, fingerprint sensors, thin and light. 

Same thing is happening with phones. For the first time ever Apple is expecting to see iPhone sales go DOWN next quarter 


Maybe an iPad air 4 with pencil and keyboard will "save" it. The pencil is pretty incredible and the smart doc connector that powers accessories might get people to upgrade from their iPad (non air)2's. iPad pro is to big and to much $$$ for most people


That is completely debatable. I have a Surface 3 and I use it more often then my MacBook Pro. 


It is absolutely what lots of people want. It isn't what everyone wants.


It's exactly what I wanted. The Surface Pro 3 is a perfect machine for my needs, and does what the iPad Pro can't. To be able to run full production suites for my music and drawing, and have the tablet form factor for when I'm chilling out. My ONLY gripe with the machine is that it doesn't play music very loud out of its onboard speakers, but nothing a Bluetooth speaker can't fix. 

That doesn't mean it's for everyone, but it has its uses.


I have both. Both has its pros and cons. There are days when I need a full blown OS where the iOS will not work for me. 


I am a little bit, tbh. Then again, I haven't read the article yet to see if this stat is really impressive. 

I know Microsoft launched a new tablet generation relatively recently, but I forget if it was before or after the iPad pro came out. Cause I'd expect apple's opening weekend sales to be strong and thus make a strong quarter, but if Microsoft was in a low sales quarter, then maybe they've had other quarters that sold wayyyy more than the iPad pro did this quarter. 

Anyways, once I clear all that up, all I'll have to say is that the iPad pro is an excellent device but I don't see that many people convinced that it's truly 'pro' even though it's an awesome device, and will lead the iPad app revolution to new heights. 


Microsoft is many things but funny is not one of them.


Surface Pro makes a great iPhone charger - when the Surface Pro doesn't overheat.


Not necessarily. I tried a tablet only school year a few years ago and it was not at all okay. Now I've switched almost entirely to the iPP and I don't think I'll need my macbook for a while...

Even people that have touchscreens, keep using the trackpad!


Relative to the trackpad on my MBP? The last thing I want to do is reach up scroll through webpages with my thumb.


_shrug_. I didn’t buy the keyboard cover for mine. I’m happy with the Bluetooth keyboard I already had. Especially since I’m a vim user, and the keyboard cover lacks an escape key.


No, it's not.

Most iPad apps don't even use the Pencil.

Most people are not buying the iPad Pro for regularly type either, and not everyone wants the same kind of keyboard.


Not at all, I will never need the keyboard. The pencil is awesome but again not needed. 


I'd rather not have the price $250 higher to do that. At least there's an option for people that want the big screen but don't care about the keyboard. 


They're talking about how the high end Surface outsold the low end Surface


It's helpful if you need to walk around with notes. 


Try writing chemistry notes in class on a laptop (probably for most subjects really).  I would have killed several times for a Surface or a iPP.  Instead I went through a small forest with paper notes, which I now can't search or carry with me.


>  Even the most basic macbook air is much more useful. It can do everything better than a tablet

The most basic macbook air cannot do *sketch* better than an iPad Pro with Pencil.


I might be in the minority, but I disagree.  I get the value of occasionally using a real keyboard with your tablet, but I think encouraging its use bastardizes what a tablet should be.   I honestly can't believe people are choosing to double the weight of their Pros for a marginal keyboard case.  


The Pixel C is not in the same category as surface pro or iPad pro in any way shape or form, I find it so weird that the blogs tried to compare it as google's contribution to that category. 

It's got an under 10" screen, 2 gb of ram, android lacks a tablet app ecosystem. The only reason it's compared is because there's an official keyboard option but.. The original iPad had an official keyboard 'option' and the current iPad airs and minis can all use various 3rd party keyboard cases. 

The pixel c is just a (laughable) competitor to the iPad Air, not pro/surface pro. 


I do not have an attachable keyboard for my Pro, nor do I want one. This is the case with two of my friends with iPad Pros, as well. The system keyboard is more than adequate (surprisingly so, in fact), and wh eh I need physical key board I vastly prefer the flexibility that a Bluetooth keyboard offers. I'm not saying that attachables are bad, just that I don't think they'd make make sense to include by default. (As in, Default hardware informs user behavior of how they're expected to use the device, and Apple doesn't expect every user to want or need a physical keyboard with their tablet)


iPad pro is more a big ass iPad that can be a hybrid. I use it as a big ass iPad and am glad I didn't have to pay extra for a keyboard cover I would never use. 


Would you pay another 100 on the base price?


You don't need the keyboard at all. 


iPad Pro is not exactly a tablet hybrid. It is just a big tablet for artists. This is the question that other companies don't get. Apple has all their products in focus. Competition is out of focus with these shapeshifter products they make. The only thing in focus that MS produces is Office; a product for a specific purpose. This is why Office is still MS's flagship. 


Then I would be forced to buy a keyboard when I might not need one.

I bought a Pro with the Logitech keyboard. The keyboard is under my bed since it's too hard to take the iPad in and out (actually just out). So I use mine without a keyboard. Works fine. I just wish I'd saved myself the $100.


Keyboards are a waste for these devices. 

I have a Surface Pro 3 and the keyboard goes mostly unused. If I do actually carry it, it's because I need something to protect the screen.

At work and at home I have Multiplicity installed so I can use my primary keyboard instead of the connected keyboard.


I saw in the news that MS was having trouble with skylake. They recently released a firmware update and it might address the not sleeping issue.


That's interesting, I know quite a few people who are really enjoying their surface.

I was actually thinking that if I were to pick between the two I would grab a surface over the iPad pro.


That's not normal. Send it in under the warranty.


Windows is not infuriating to use, it's also not hard to use. I vastly prefer it on a desktop.

That said, you are right about the iPad not crashing/hanging etc., iOS is a good OS. One of the most consistent I've ever experienced.


I really like my SP4, but there are definitely some glaring bugs. Sleep/wake is inconsistent. Sometimes it seems to not actually go to sleep (so the battery drains), sometimes it takes forever to wake up, and sometimes the screen doesn't come back on when it's waking--but the IR camera for sign-in lights up, so I think it's a display issue. The pen performance also seems prone to interference causing shoddy accuracy or breaks when writing/drawing. 
These aren't deal breakers for me yet, but they're pretty much inexcusable for what is supposed to be a performance/high-end device.  


I have a SP3 and replaced. Just had no use for it with an iPad Air 2, different as they may be. 


Surface users don't believe me that the wake up is slow. 


Man, the SP4 also has the slow wake time? I experienced that with the SP3, and it was irritating.

The iPad Pro has been flawless for me. It makes for a far better tablet than the Surface, but the latter is more useful once you attach a keyboard. Only thing is, the Surface makes for a mediocre laptop. I've said it many times, but I would rather have two devices that excel at their roles than one device that does both, but isn't great at either.


What kind of drivel is this? The current release of Photoshop is heavily designed for touch. So are many non-app programs.


I run it every day with Photoshop and don't have any of the problems you are talking about.  You can always just use a Bluetooth keyboard if you don't want to snap the type cover back on.


At least you can run Photoshop on it. Out of the gate, SP is better cause it can legitimately function as a laptop. The worst thing you can say is that it's functionally the same as a laptop when working.

You're talking like the portability is a negative. 


Yeah but I *can* easily download torrents on a Surface. Use Chrome with extensions, attach a USB printer and other peripherals not supported by Apple,... 

And I seriously doubt photoshop is "one of the most popular programs for Windows". Most people I know don't know how to use it. Hell they rather use MS Paint or Picase.

Still prefer the iPad/MacBook combo but diminishing the advantage of the Surface because it can't run photoshop well seems like a silly argument. 


The thing is, all you have to do is snap the keyboard on and you've got a device that runs Photoshop and every other piece of professional software really well.  It *is* good at that.  It isn't a compromised laptop experience, its actually a pretty great one.


Sure, maybe someday there will be all minds of powerful software that only uses touch input, and someday I won't need backwards compatibility with the last couple decades of software.  But for getting work done today, for me, the surface Pro (and the other similar machines) are leagues ahead of an ipad. 


Not made for touch?  Pop the kickstand and use a mouse. Problem solved. 


> This means that one cannot even take advantage of the portability of the Surface when using one of its hallmark features (the pen) in one of the most popular programs for Windows.

Yeah but the keyboard folds up so its no less portable. 


Eh I can't tell if you actually think using the keyboard for a program designed to be used with the keyboard is a bad thing? What the hell can you do with and iPad Pro and photoshop? 

Plus laying the tablet flat and using the pen to do masks while still having access to the keyboard shortcuts is huge. Something tells me you've never used a surface with photoshop, or even used photoshop at all. 

Fan boys need to learn the shit, and this applies to both sides.


Sucks as a touch screen device? Have you even used it?


OS X with a touch screen would be just as clunky and awkward as iOS with a keyboard and mouse. I don't understand why people keep begging for it.

Think about it: a mouse cursor represents a single point of contact with multiple "modes" (hovering, left click, right click, scroll wheel up, scroll wheel down, middle click. Don't forget to modify all of these with different keys: shift-click, command-click, etc). A touch interface has only one mode (touching) with multiple points of contact (i.e. multi-touch).

iOS was designed to work with touch gestures where your fingers are literally moving across the screen. Gestures on OS X (using the Magic Trackpad/Mouse) work by keeping the cursor stationary as your fingers move around on a separate surface. The interaction model is completely different on a very fundamental level.

OS X software has evolved around the keyboard and mouse. iOS software has evolved around a touch screen. Different tools solve different problems.

There's no wisdom in attaching a saw blade to a hammer.


Good luck porting OSX and all it's apps to ARM. It's not nearly as simple. 

Now if they were to offer a x86 based system, they would have to opt for the Core M (or go with fans) which will certainly make the device sluggish. 


>I mean, it should be able to run both iOS and OSX, right? Why not let you switch when you need to?

Because Apple believes that the path to truly productive mobile apps isn't starting with desktop apps and just adding touch support after the fact, but rather building an app that handles the basics well in a way that's native to touch and then adding functionality. Khoi Vinh has a [better take](http://www.subtraction.com/2015/12/01/doing-real-design-work-on-an-ipad/) on the problem of iPad and productivity than people who believe that the **only** solution is to use a desktop OS, particularly his concluding remarks:

>What will get us to truly viable workflows on iPad is not replicating what came before, but rather newer, better, more elegant ways of working that are truly native to the platform. We’re not quite there yet today, but we’re on our way.



Well there's the rub.  Despite claims about a "laptop" quality processor, a big part of the reason the iPad Pro is as powerful as it is hinges on the fact it was designed to work exclusively with iOS.  Trying to run anything else on it would be...disappointing.   Apple is betting that people want light, powerful devices now, and the software will evolve to meet their needs.  Conversely, MS bet that people want just one, all-powerful OS now, and that the bulky hardware needed to run it would eventually evolve.   

So far Apple seems to be winning but there's really no finish line, so for now it's just about who can make the most money today.

Create iOS apps with a fully featured IDE


Design the next iPad Pro, in every circuit detail, not only a mock up of their apparency.

Including the next iOS version.


The Surface *is* x86. It is more functional than iOS because it isn't limited to what Microsoft will allow the way Apple does for its system.


By "everyone" you mean "a bunch of grumpy people on Reddit", right?


Almost 2 billion in revenue. 


People call everything by Apple a flop, even though Apple usually kills it in sales with whatever they're doing at the time. 


[deleted]


The surface is a niche device too since most people would either buy a laptop or a small tablet. 


Maybe people just like it more than the Surface. 

When I used to work somewhere that sold the Surface, I would say about 80% of them were returned within a week. 

Not sure why. Just what I witnessed. 


I'm sick of everyone still defending Microsoft even after abysmal sales.

Microsoft was king 10 years ago. Now that mobile is king & desktop use has drastically declined, we simply don't need Microsoft at all anymore 


windows and xbox were already established brands, the surface (and its form factor) is not.


Yup compared to the overall tablet sales it's disappointing, but for MSFT's poorly executed efforts in promoting the Surface, I think this isn't that bad.



And have you considered how much of the market Apple has? You can't just look at the number in a vaccuum. Where did all these armchair investors come from?


[deleted]


Well the Surface Pro 4 came out a couple of months ago.


But why? Desktops work better for any serious work.


[deleted]


Ios only really works on a phone iPads are just lazy for stretching it out to fit a bigger screen


[deleted]


I plan on getting the 256GB/16 GB RAM one.  Again, I'd rather get a computer that happens to be in a portable tablet form than a giant iOS tablet. 


And I mean it. Why would I spend more on a device that only allows mobile and tablet apps? I'm not searching the market for a tablet. I'm searching for a computer, and the Surface Pro 4 is exactly what I'm looking for. 


I think you are probably more of an expert on what "feels" better to you... I was all ready to get the Surface, but the comparative experience was that MSFT was a little frustrating and the Apple Pencil nailed it. At that point, if the main reason I'm getting the device is obviously tilted to one product or another, the benchmarks and expert opinions become less relevant.


This is where Apple controlling every level of the hardware and software is such an advantage. The screen and software refresh mechanisms are designed to work together carefully to minimize input latency. The pencil fits into this arrangement as well, to maximize accuracy and minimize latency again.

You can't just integrate a bunch of generic components and hope to get a similar outcome, like the surface


[deleted]


Well, why do you trust fucking reviewers? They don't write the reality, they write what their readers want to read.

That's why there are so many anti-Apple articles and shit.


Surface and pro software is gonna cost you a lot more than an IPP though


Apple and Microsoft's n-trig are both similar tech wise (active capacitive pens) than say Wacom (magnetic field). 

Now Apple and Microsoft approach in inking is a bit different. Apple prioritize raw inking, which gets you the lag free feel, but then you notice the interpolation afterwards. Microsoft's will first complete the interpolation and then output the "final" ink, which results in lag (but at least you don't get dancing lines). I personally prefer Apple's method, as I usually don't notice the dancing lines, unless I'm actually looking for it. Also, I find Apple's interpolation fits my writing style better.


They don't have $2B in cash.

They have over $200B in cash. It's just that very little of it is in the US.


He's being sarcastic.


Sure, a flop that sold 25% more than its closest competitor's entire lineup.


I'm interested in whatever results in a better product. I'd love to see a successful start-to-finish 100% Microsoft device and ecosystem. The OEM setup is why I abandoned Microsoft long ago. 


[deleted]


Not to mention they are different niches if we are honest. 


One new expensive tablet vs the entire surface line? I...would consider that a pretty large blow. But that's just me


And plus, it's a brand new product.

Obviously there will be a sales surge when it's first released.


Fully agreed on the scaling issue. MS has not sortes out HiDPI at all because they fully rely on developers implementing it, with the fallback being "let's give users a headache". Even OSX would be a better tablet OS at this point.


I am not sure whether you actually own a Surface Book. I have had it since launch. The device had its fair share of bugs and but it performs really well as a tablet now and even better as a straight up laptop. 

I have tried the iPad Pro but desktop versions of anything you want work so much better than iOS. All Adobe products have been updated to work with touch and the Pen. It's unfair to compare the two since the Surface Book(the i7) costs almost double the iPad Pro.

I am trying to be as unbiased as possible since I swapped out my MacBook Air for the Surface Book and still own an iPad Air and iPhone 6s+



Again, the iPad is a more mature market. iPad's surface had no legs until version 3. Microsoft's tablets also cost more. This is the first series of computers they developed themselves. 

Don't forget, Microsoft posted very strong growth on their tablet lines.


Yeah because you're not doing much on it to begin with compared to a Surface ;)


That won't happen. OS X isn't designed for touch, iOS is. What is more likely is that iPads become far more capable over time.


There's nothing random about splitting the market into the operating system.  All of the hardware is based on ecosystem lockin, which means people shop for android, ios, or windows.

And I don't care if apple wins or loses, I'm just trying to paint an accurate picture.


It is an old non 365 license. All I know is that the surface has 600 dollars in licensing fees just for Windows and whatever other software has to be loaded and there is no similar overhead cost for iPads. 


The difference between mobile and full OS is waning rapidly and maintaining an archaic licensing structure is just going to cause them to lose enterprise business.


It's more than that. The iPad is currently selling more units than some PC hardware companies do...which sure must make those PC companies nervous if they're not able to outsell a "dying product."


[deleted]


Agreed. I like mine, even with all the issues like overheating and crashes. I stayed away from other hybrids because I wanted a full OS. If the iPad had OSX I would have been all over it


You're right. I think time will tell but I think this will be a misstep for Microsoft when we look back. They're going to be forced to support legacy hardware and software and that really holds back innovation.

Compare that with Apple and Google's strategy, they have free reign to what they want with iOS and Android. 


What a meaningless comment. 

If you invented gravy flavoured ice cream you would almost certainly be able to find some number of people who liked it. You also would be able to find many people who didn't want it. What does that tell you? It tells you fuck all, that's what. Should Ben & Jerry's come out with gravy flavoured ice cream? If they struggle to sell it does that mean they should continue trying to push it on consumers since "it is absolutely what lots of people want". 

Don't make pointless comments. It wastes all of our time. 


But its Windows and Windows just sucks :(.


It's the Christmas quarter so it should be pretty high sales, and Surface doesn't get nearly as big of a launch event as iPad does anyway. I think the launches of both Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book happened in the quarter, though. 


[deleted]


That's close to 100%!


If you use a laptop on a desk, then for sure you're right. But if you actually use your laptop on your lap, it's way more convenient to touch the screen then use the track pad. 


Dude, sit on a chair and put your laptop on your lap. Your arm rests comfortably holding the laptop by the screen and all u Goto do is flick Ur thumb. There's no reaching. If anything your bending your arm and forcing your bicep to have your hand on the track pad while the laptop is in your lap. 


Are you serious?  No ESC key?  How crazy.  The ESC key is so automatic with me.


Oh right, thanks for pointing that out.


If you're drawing structures, paper notes are superior. There's freedom there that you don't get with any device. 


Yes it can. With one of those digital sketch pads some graphic designers use. 


I agree. I bought a keyboard case for my iPad mini but hated it. Suddenly my tablet was locked in landscape, double the bulk, and I still felt the on screen keyboard was quicker. I bought a stand alone iOS BT keyboard for the occasional times a keyboard is useful, rarely use it but it allows my tablet to be a tablet whether I'm using it or not. 


I would argue that tablets like the iPad Pro would sell _better_ if they came automatically bundled with a keyboard. Yes, the keyboard is optional, but if you knew you didn't have to pony up an extra $100 or so for it, that makes the tablet itself a much more attractive buy.  




I think that's due to design. The Keyboard is horrid compared to other options


What do you mean "should be"? I use my iPad as a lightweight media storage and consumption device. Once in a while, I attach a keyboard to take meeting notes or to write with. Who are you to tell me that I'm doing it wrong?


Bill Gates' vision for a tablet has always included a stylus and a keyboard that you can detach it from. This vision was from the 1990s to early 2000s.

This is "what a tablet should be".

Of course you wouldn't believe that because of some slick marketing i suppose.


The Ipad Pro isn't really in the same category as the Surface Pro either.  The Ipad Pro is still just a tablet with mobile apps.  Where as The Surface Pro is a fully functional computer in a tablet body.  


The Pixel C was supposed to be a small tablet Chromebook originally, which would have made it substantially more like at least the Surface, which doesn't really have a tablet app ecosystem either. 


I bought one of those keyboards at Ross when the iPad 2 came out for like 15 bucks. I wonder what happened to it. It was really awkward to use though as you forced to use portrait mode. 


Yea, I'm not sure why people are saying its a Surface Pro/iPad Pro competitor

Google priced the Pixel C at the same price as the Surface 3/iPad Air 2, hence the specs being around the Surface 3/iPad Air 2


I hate to be that guy, but the screen is >10" by .2". But yes, it's more comparable to a 10" tablet. 


Oh god. The fanboy. It hurts. 

If anything. The iPad Pro and Pixel C are the category sharers. Both being different from the surface. 


>The system keyboard is more than *adequate* (surprisingly so, in fact), and *wh eh* I…

Seems like it could be better.

I'm all about the keyboard case because I do a ton of my administrative works and writing on iPad Pro. I don't think it (or even the Pencil) should be included though, as plenty of people don't need it and shouldn't be paying for it. The less Apple has to put in the box, the better. 


Do you run Win10? I find that the on screen keyboard is completely inconsistent on when it comes up. Tablet mode is unusable for me because of this because I don't see a button to bring it up manually. Tries to get some tablet mode apps, but many are RT only (*why does it even show them in the store, to annoy me?*). Then I also have to problem of a lack of DPI setting - I need to set the desktop in a small setting because of some software, but this even makes tablet mode too small for fingers and I can't find a separate setting. Win10 is IMO a complete mess and unusable as a tablet OS.


They could have it, at least with the iPad Pro, choose an accessory, like Pencil or Keyboard.


I have an sp4 and I only use it without the keyboard like 30% of the time. Most of the time it's a laptop replacement, and a pretty decent one in my opinion. 


It didn't fix my surface book. The software is seriously problematic since launch. 


My SP4 wakes up from hibernate within 5 seconds, and wakes up from sleep within a second.

It has its problems but that isn't one of them. I love it to death and for my use case (design using a stylus, programming, light gaming) it has no competitors, but it definitely is glitch as hell.


SP4 owner here. It isn't that slow to start up. Maybe a few seconds. However unless they've fixed it I did see an issue people were complaining about that it does take forever to startup if the keyboard is flipped behind it. Like 4-5 times slower than if the keyboard is out like normal or completely removed. No explanation as to why that I saw.


If I need something that runs a desktop system, it isn't going to be a Surface. It'll be something that doesn't compromise the desktop experience, like a Macbook Air or Dell XPS. If I need a tablet device, it isn't going to be Surface (that lacks the quantity of quality touch-optimized Modern UI apps).

The fact that the iPad Pro is "only" an iPad and sells for as much as a Surface Pro (which can run desktop software) is still able to outsell the Surface Pro does indeed say something.


You can also run the PS mobile app just like on the iPad Pro, which is optimized for mobile and pen use


Of you want to run Photoshop, you want a 5K iMac with graphics tablet or an iPad Pro running AstroPad.

Not a dinky ULV processor with a pen that doesn't even have tilt sensitivity!


I have on (a Pro 3), and I find it to be a pretty compromised laptop experience. It's *great* as a docked computer. Like, really great. Having it plugged into a monitor and a real keyboard/mouse, while still being able to pull the tablet over and use the pen/touch when necessary is awesome. 

It's also ok on a desk/table, where the keyboard is well supported and there's plenty of space for the kickstand. Although it starts to weaken there, slightly because of the keyboard, but mostly because of the trackpad (ironically, it was still one of the best windows trackpads I've ever used, but nowhere near a mac). 

But as a *lap*top? It's no good at all. It's just not enjoyable to use away from a desk. It's not enjoyable to use in places where portability is really key (i.e. airplanes). It's just not convenient for a lot of the casual use cases where normal laptops excel. I guess it's just not meant for that, but for me, that was a huge letdown. 

I used the hell out of it when I was in college. I'd still recommend one to college students considering it. Great device for the most common use cases there. But I just haven't found much of a place for it after graduation. I tried to make it fit for a while, but eventually I just got a new Mac and I don't regret it at all. 


Have you? It really does suck for touch. It's consensus that the iPad is a better tablet while the surface is a better laptop


yes. and I hate it. I gave it a try many times. I have one. I can't stand trying to press the tiny buttons to close stuff, or scroll, or anything normal. too many compromises.


You should make a bot that replies this to any post in this sub that says a variant of "it should be able to run OS X"


>I don't understand why people keep begging for it.

A few years ago, people were begging for Apple to allow Flash for iOS, even though Flash was a security hazard, had performance issues even on computers that were way faster than the iPad, and wasn't designed for touch. Palm, Google, and Blackberry were even working with Adobe to incorporate Mobile Flash into their respective mobile OS's. It was only after Adobe killed off Flash that most people were able to acknowledge that Flash wasn't a very good experience (even that took a few more years).


Good point.  I'd imagine they'd be able to compile their own software to arm quite quickly (and already have) but would then need to have an all new app store that only includes compatible software.


Except that the flawed premise is that there are "newer, better, more elegant ways of working" when it comes to productivity applications. I don't really accept that. An entirely touch based UI is terrible for productivity in a number of spaces (though there are certainly a few exceptions). It's ironic that the argument by another user above this reply was "There's no wisdom in attaching a saw blade to a hammer". I agree with that, except that it also applies to the fact that Productivity software doesn't need "saving" by shoe-horning into some touch-only version.

People are going to be much more efficient and productive with a mouse and keyboard over a touch-only interface, irrespective of whatever revolutionary changes you make to the software. There's a reason why Macbooks aren't being cannibalized by iPads.

The big advantage MS has over Apple at the moment though, is that they have a vision towards unifying both worlds. Windows 10 works very well as a full desktop OS with touch support. You can use it just like any other desktop OS without ever using touch, but you can also use it quite well in touch-only mode. It would be in Apple's best interest to think about something along similar lines for further down the road. Touch isn't going anywhere, but nor are desktop operating systems and non-touch user input devices like physical keyboards and touchpads/mice.


Um, the Surface Pro isn't bulky. The first gen was. But only that one.

Well, it was across all the tech "journalists" sites too, but I guess that's not too different from redditors. 


Oxymoronic.


So a single niche iPad outsold an entire niche lineup of Surface tablets. 


[Not bad for a "companion device"](http://www.inquisitr.com/2709791/ipad-pro-is-just-a-companion-device-according-to-microsoft/#utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheInquisitrTechnology+%28The+Inquisitr+»+Technology%29)


But what about Microsoft marketing the Surface as both a laptop and a tablet? Shouldn't that result in most PC/tablet shoppers choosing a Surface computer?


You have a point. The Surface Pro really is an in-between device. Not quite powerful enough to use as a laptop replacement. But still a little too big to use as a tablet. 

To get one configured the same as my laptop would be maybe $1000 more than my laptop. Which is what I should have done....


> we simply don't need Microsoft at all anymore

Talk for yourself.

Windows offers advantages over OSX, specially when it comes to hardware. For example the Windows gaming market is even bigger than the whole Mac market, by a long stretch.


Everyone loves the underdog.  
However, I feel that Microsoft is transitioning into a cloud services company and these devices will go away once OEMs start making decent Surface competitors, which will bring their price down.


Don't let that fool you. Microsoft is still very much important in everywhere else besides mobile. 


Right now I have a MacBook that has bootcamp win10 and I basically run all my school work off Windows. 


OS X is there for things besides work. 


Sure they're alternatives to programs but the entire college isn't going to buy macs. 


Hyperbole much. The consumer market may not need Microsoft, but I assure the the enterprise market does. I run at least 3 programs that are only built for Windows, and there are 3 other programs in my company that are the same. 


> I'm sick of everyone still defending Microsoft even after abysmal sales.

You know what company had abysmal sales not so long ago?

Yeah, Apple.


But how else will we get someone to try and pass a bunch of squares off as UI?


Use hasn't declined, sales has. People are still using desktops from 10 years ago.


The iPhone wasn't an established brand, it leveraged the iPod's awareness.

The iPod before that wasn't an established brand, it leveraged Apple's Macintosh awareness.

The Macintosh wasn't an established brand, it leveraged the Apple ]['s popularity.

Microsoft, meanwhile, can't seem to string one thing into the next. Windows Phone is a turkey, the Surface devices are selling at a trickle compared to general OEM sales.

Don't tell me Microsoft doesn't have the resources to make Surface a best-selling product because I refuse to believe a company that sells hundreds of millions of Windows licenses a year is fundamentally incapable of doing it.



Poorly executed marketing... maybe... but certainly not cheap.  They spent a lot more than Apple did on product placement in movies, TV, and NFL.

> And have you considered how much of the market Apple has?

Microsoft is almost as big as Apple, with $434B in market capitalization and 118K employees.

They're not a small company.


What are the comparison numbers though you can't just say "market share". How many did Microsoft well I previous years with a smaller lineup, are sales up or down across lines, etc. 

That said, the way i see it is this is a category specifically in which Microsoft had the entire market and still has most. I still don't think the iPad pro is truly a competing product. I don't think your average consumer is considering an iPad pro for a production tablet rather they just see it as a bigger iPad. That's what most people I've seen with it use it as


Long term vision.

Desktops have existed for years. They exist. Surface wants to carry the desktop input forward and have touch as well. iPad breaks from the desktop to say 'we think there's another way', and by breaking from the past, if it becomes a mega-popular choice (without any desktop) it forces companies who write pro apps to write them for the product. That is the point. Full PS done right for touch from the ground up on something like an iPad Pro could conceivably be superior to the desktop version. I'm sure you may agree, but we haven't seen it. I'd love to see what it might be like.

> Desktops work better for any serious work.

Is a subjective phrase in a vacuum. Desktops have more features and are absolutely better for certain things, without question. I use a desktop, I no longer own any tablet and have no need for one. But when it comes to a tablet to truly move things forward for that computing model you need to break from the past. Yes, there's teething, yes there will be problems, yes there's no guarantee you get there in the end. But I prefer Apple's philosophy when it comes to tablets over Microsoft's.

People like to say iPad sales have slumped, but iPad this quarter outsold the Mac 3-1. iPads last a long time and tend to be very reliable which is why sales have slowed—there are so many in use. iPad is here to stay as far as I'm concerned. And one of these days (without a desktop) iPad will do most things most people need when it comes to large screen computation. Not all people, but most.


Not the person you're replying to, but I got an iPad Pro because I much prefer iOS to Windows 10 on a tablet. I found the SP3 to be a pretty mediocre tablet experience, and only a small part of that was due to hardware. Windows 10 just isn't as nice on a tablet as iOS is.

I use it for the same tasks I would use my rMBP. Writing, outlining, editing, web browsing, messaging, YouTube, etc. I can also draw with it, which is a lot of fun, but I haven't put in real time yet. The larger screen size makes me enjoy it far, far more than any iPad I've used previously. It's been great. No complaints, save that battery life is the worst of any iPad.

I don't know how you can consider something the size of a small MacBook Air "stupidly large". Jesus fuck do you have the hands of a 3 year old?


If you think that's bad, you should see android on tablets. It doesn't take advantage of the real estate at all. 


Is the idea that it's a full device replacement?  I thought it was mostly supposed to be a full pro level art/graphics tablet.  It seemed to me that's what they were selling it as.

Kind of reminds me how one of my economists was watching me enter into a spreadsheet in Numbers and then complains, "Why aren't you using Excel?"  My touche is, "Why aren't you using R?"


For me it's not that OS X isn't touch-optimized; it's that iOS doesn't have a replacement for touch. Yeah, I can use a keyboard for everything but I'm just not that kind of guy, even on desktop. I like using a mouse or trackpad. The iPad Pro's keyboard should have a small trackpad or touch-sensitive keys like the Blackberry Priv. I shouldn't have to poke and prod at the screen I'm working on, or fully rely on the keyboard to do everything. It's just a hobbled way of interacting with it. Even Steve Jobs criticized the idea of poking at a touch-sensitive MacBook on stage.

I really want to jump on an iPad Pro, but as much as guys like Federico Viticci keep banging on the "no, really, iOS can totally replace your OS X machine," I really don't believe it. There's just basic day-to-day stuff that's *effortless* on my MacBook Air that would require more effort or be straight-up impossible on an iPad Pro, and that's a problem. Like you said, if I have to keep my MBA around, what's the point?

That said, I'm still never going back to Windows.


I think I love you, and I don't get why more people don't think this way about what software it came loaded with. The iPad Pro should have sported the same OS as its laptops, etc. I would have bought one instantly. 


i honestly 100% agree with you, and i thought everything you said was very articulate and insightful. the only thing is that you and i are obviously the minority, because read the headline. the general public vastly prefers Apple's way of handling this, as proven by these very initial sales of this product. it's all about what you as a user want, and right now there are more of *those* "yous" than there are of *us* "yous."

lol at my last sentence.


I hear you.  I think given the promise of both, the Surface Book seems like a much more usable device.  However, for people like me, neither one would ever come close to using it as my sole work-related device. 

While I don't need two spreadsheets on display on a device at the same time to be productive, I do have other needs and the iPad Pro is better suited in a lot of ways... specifically graphics/photo/video work.  In fact, for some graphics/photo work, it's the best device (mobile, portable or workstation) that I could possibly use.

That's why I went with the iPad Pro after a fairly extensive evaluation period with both.  At best, the Surface Book just didn't work for me at all as a tablet and as a PC, it made me want to rather have my MacBook with me.  Whereas with the iPad Pro, I thoroughly enjoyed it as a tablet, isolated my use of it to not consider it when I should be using a MacBook, and then found it more useful for graphics/photo work than any other computer  for many tasks.

I should also add that I don't mind having multiple devices... in fact, I rather prefer it.

I'm not saying that Microsoft took the wrong approach and Apple took the right one.  Many of the problems with the Surface Book will likely be fleshed out over time as will the technology.

And of course anyone who really needs "one device" and is hell bent on getting a hybrid, the Surface Book is the better option... it's just I would consider the best option would be to give up on the desire for the tablet and get a MacBook.


Seriously, the main reason people buy Surface Pro's is to run **legacy apps**???

If I wanted to run legacy stuff, I would stick with my legacy hardware and don't spend thousands of dollars!

That explains everything about current Microsoft situation!


I'd like to hear more about how iPads can't be used for "real work" from PC gamer dumbasses


Price wise they aren't that different. You might as well get one that you can plug into a monitor (or two), has sd card slot, etc. etc. It's just a better device.


Because you are going to buy a shitty laptop and a shitty tablet, but if you buy an iPad pro you are getting an amazing tablet.  Also the idea of mobile apps being shittier than desktop apps is rapidly disappearing and the iPad pro is pushing that even further. 


But MS controls all levels of the surface. It should have those same advantages. It's sad that it doesn't.


idk, I used the Apple Pencil and while I preferred the weight of it, I found the tilt drawing to pretty marginal and definitely appreciated the functionality of a right click button and a configurable eraser on the Surface pen. Plus, I found that with the friction tip bought for the pen it really felt like drawing on paper compared to the normal feeling of both the Surface and the Ipad of drawing on smooth glass.


They also quite often write their own opinions, which when they are an expert in the field they are wrinivn about are worth paying attention to. If you watch good reviews. 


Thanks for the insights! I'm in the market for a surface for school, but would love to compare the styli first hand


Oh wow. Can't believe I made that typo. Bit of a difference. Lol


That doesn't make it any less of a flop.
The fanboyism in this sub is hilarious.



I abandoned MS in 2008, told myself I'd never go back to Windows, and now I have a Surface Book

Apple vs MS is a war of commoditization.  Old school MS used to be expensive software, cheap OEM hardware.  Apple flipped it to be expensive hardware, cheap apps.  Whichever company raises the value of software to the point its no longer disposable is gonna win.


I'm not denying it's a big enough margin, but definitely not a huge blow. 


The Surface Book was also a brand new product.


Indeed. It will be interesting to see what the next few quarters bring.


I don't own a Surface Book.  My experience was with visiting a Microsoft Store and using it in-store with multiple sales people (because it took 3 to figure out how to detach the keyboard) and then given an evaluation unit for a period of time (about 2 weeks).

Detaching the keyboard from the Surface Book is a cluster fuck conceptually.  Instead of just pulling the keyboard off, you have to push a button, that activates a software mechanism which may or may not work.  You can hold it down for a period of time, pound away at it, or just wait until it decides to work.  That's just totally unacceptable and resulted in me never removing the keyboard in real-use cases (I tried with several units several times, always the same experience).

On the iPad Pro, you pull and the magnets release.  You get the keyboard anywhere close, and the keyboard attaches.  That any kind of electronic connection was made between the two was something I was totally oblivious to until much later thinking "wait, was that Bluetooth or what, because I never configured anything".

As a tablet, is sucks compared to an iPad.  Besides the lesser physical attributes, it also lacks the tablet ecosystem.  Sure, many *software applications* are "touch enabled", but unless they're truly optimized for the device, they end up giving you a "why am I using this on a tablet when I could be using a MacBook?"  And when it comes to modern (mobile) apps there are many (specifically when it comes to games and IoT) that are not available.

Of course if you want a "PC as a tablet" and want to run "PC software applications" then there's no comparison.  You're not going to run Visual Studio on an iPad.  But for me, my PC needs make a tablet the wrong tool for the job, and for my tablet needs, the Surface Book is sub-par.

I've been keeping my eye on the Surface since the beginning.  It's always seemed compelling, until I've gotten my hands on one.  The exact opposite has always been true with the iPad.  I never had any intention of getting an iPad until I got my hands on one.

I do think Microsoft will eventually get the Surface right.  The decision to go with ARM early on was a an obvious mistake, and Intel architecture and other technology is so rapidly improving that the PC as a tablet makes more and more sense each year.  Bugs and design flaws can be fleshed out and the ecosystem may eventually catch up.

But all of this is suggesting that Microsoft gets there before anyone else (including Apple) does.  Microsoft is a hard company to bet on in this space.


> Again, the iPad is a more mature market.

Again. iPad version 4. Surface version 4.


Because its designed to not require the immense amount of busy work and other accumulated bullshit that windows obsolete design from the 60's requires you to do.

Listen up windows fans. Windows is obsolete crap and is slowly showing itself out the door. There was never any need for the giant amount of people that spend their lives maintaining windows systems.

Oh, and since you are apparently not up to date, iOS on iPAD has a very large and growing ecosystem.


Yeah, that must be it… or the OS that's old and convoluted.


>OS X isn't designed for touch

Windows, outside of Metro/Modern/Universal, isn't either. If I can run the whole package of Adobe's stuff (and not a limited and also trimmed down selection of it), I'm going to go for the thing that can run the whole package.


$600 doesn't sound right, however a big difference is you run full blown Office 2010, 2013, 2016, or 365 vs an iPad that's incapable of that. I would fully expect the Surface to be comparable to another laptop... Since that's what it is. 


While yes they need to update their licensing structure you would have to be out of your mind if you think enterprises are going go away from Microsoft because of licensing. 


music and tv shows/movies sound very good on it compared to previous models. 


Been an iPad user since they came out. I love it, but for me its not a fully productive computer. I mainly use it for surfing, work notes, email. Some times remoting into a computer. But for most part its surfing on the couch. To me a "full" OS is more natural to get work done. I checked out the iPad pro. While it definitely looks awesome, the hindered multitasking and lack of "full" apps keep me away. The size does not improve any thing for me over the iPad Air.

Now if the iPad air 4 comes with apple pencil I'm in. But it will still be for causal work (taking notes will be awesome), and surfing.


"but that's not what people want"

Is not a subjective statement.



Interesting. 

I own an iPad Pro and if it shipped with OSX i would have bought an iPad Air 2 instead. 

I absolutely do not want OSX on a touch based device. 


One of Microsoft biggest benefits and greatest curse, how long they support things. 

Which is also why windows 10 is different than the others. If they can get everyone on one OS instead of 3 or 4, that's a ton of work saved. 


Only in /r/apple would you see a product like the Surface Pro compared to gravy flavored ice cream.

Take off the fanboy pants for a moment and give it an honest look.


I'd rather have Windows, and be able to run full apps, than use iOS in a tablet form factor. Windows has its gripes, but it's much better than it has been in the past. 

I know many share my sentiments, but if Apple made an iPad Pro that used a hybrid of iOS and OSX, or a touch friendly version of OSX with sandboxed iOS apps, they would have my money. The pen feels much more natural on the iPad Pro, but I need to be able to use VST's and a full music production studio on the go.


Gotcha, cool then. 2 million sales is still a little weak when you realize how many iPhones Apple sells in a quarter, but still good 


I've got an SP3. It's been sitting unused for the last 3 months while I type this on iPad.

(Oddly enough I just released I've forgotten which iPad revision it is. The first one with fingerprint ID.)


nah the iPad pro has reached parity with paper as an input medium from what I found when I tested in the store (I spent almost half an hour drawing out reactions trying out different pen settings).  You then get proper erasers, colours, cut/paste/move, metadata, and would have been perfect.  


iPP with an apple pencil and penultimate is like paper notes, but superior. It's easy to cut and paste, draw, backup, create new pages, change the paper type (lined, ruled, graph) etc.

Granted it has downsides like being way more expensive, and needing to charge.


With a digital sketch pad, you must look at the screen instead of at your hand. This is worse, not better.


Yeah a laptop + a wired non-display stylus pad sounds way better than just an iPad. /s



I got one of those, really no comparison imo.  Much better than using a mouse obviously, but I didn't find it practical (or that transportable) and haven't used it in years. 


> if you knew you didn't have to pony up an extra $100 or so

Selling you a bundle doesn't make the price of the keyboard go away. They would just raise the price by 100$ and call it a day.


I wouldn't say that means they're in completely different categories. The iPad pro is every bit as powerful, and it has some exclusive app suites. The app support will come, that's part of the point. 

Both are 12-13", have stylus support, keyboard support 


But the surface has pro Windows app ecosystem. I totally agree it doesn't have a good metro app ecosystem, and I personally think that's ridiculous and find the whole surface line to be junk from a tablet point of view, but the people who like it, like it because it's a full fledged computer that's pretty thin. 


Windows has a tablet app ecosystem. It's just not as good as Apple's or Android's. 


They never made it for lightning. The angle probably would've broken the Lightning connector anyways 


My point is it's in line with the 9.7" iPads, not the 12-13" 


....12-13" screens, 4+ gb ram, smart connector and keyboard, pencil/stylus support, powerful processor. Pro full Windows apps, excellent developing pro iPad app ecosystem. 

Vs a 9.x" screen, 2 gb of ram (which is pretty low for android), no active stylus, a laughably nonexistent app ecosystem (android dev community gave up on tablets like 4 years ago), not particularly powerful processor. 

What is with rabid redditors calling random people fanboys when they're mad about nothing? Especially when you're wrong as shit. Cognitive dissonance?


Even though I think the iPad is not in the same pack as the Surface its definitely way ahead of the Pixel C. 


I can hit about 80wpm on the iPad Pro (up from a max of 70 on the older iPads). I would be able to sustain this speed easier, but I somehow keep double-tapping the spacebar no matter what I do. I wonder if anyone else has this problem.

80 might sound impressive, but I'm a lot faster with a regular keyboard. To be fair, I don't do much long-form writing on the iPad's virtual keyboard. I could probably get it closer to 100 with more practice.


Sorry, I meant the iPad Pro. I've seldom considered what the tablet only experience would be like on a Surface Pro. From your description, it sounds problematic. 


My Win10 has a button next to clock on the dock that toggles the on screen keyboard, I might have enabled it in settings somewhere. 

But there is no comparison. I find the iOS on screen keyboard to be a joy and very useable and I found the Win10 on screen keyboard not nearly as good. Since my Win10 device is a 2-in-1 so I don't really need need an on screen keyboard. 


I can do that now. 


q. e. d. 

SP3, first wake up after a few hours.


> The fact that the iPad Pro is "only" an iPad and sells for as much as a Surface Pro (which can run desktop software) is still able to outsell the Surface Pro does indeed say something.

Yup, Apple is a powerful brand. Ipad Pro outselling the Surface is not surprising given Apple's position and it's command of the tablet market. If you really want to understand if Microsoft's approach is the preferred method, then you'd have to consider a counterfactual where Apple makes a Surface-like device.

As for what you will personally buy, it's up to you. I'd say that the SP4 should be a great device for anyone looking at an ultrabook.


Yup, the mobile app. On iOS. Exactly my point.


> Of you want to run Photoshop, you want a 5K iMac with graphics tablet or an iPad Pro running AstroPad.
> Not a dinky ULV processor with a pen that doesn't even have tilt sensitivity!

Is this anywhere close to a fair comparison?


The pro 4 is better.  Not worlds different, but getting there.  Keyboard and trackpad much improved (again).  Actually if anybody has a surface pro 3, consider getting the sp4 keyboard because its nice and works fine.

I don't seem to be in situations where using it on my lap is something i want to do, but if I did that a lot, I'd probably go with something else.  I use it on the bar or at restaurants fairly often, works great there.


I mean the iPad is a better tablet. But the Surface's touch interface works very well. The Surface Pro 4's touch is spectacular and reads perfectly. The only things that have issue with the touch are 3rd party applications like Chrome and obviously things like Terminal in a Linux distro. Anything made by Microsoft while it may not have the best interface ever is usually overly optimized for tablets.

I'm not hating on the iPad Pro, but the Surface is a great touch screen device.


That's my point. MS started out with a universal OS but clunky hardware.  They are evolving.  Apple's tablet hardware has been state of the art since the beginning, but they're relying in developers to create iOS-compatible versions of their best desktop software.  They are both getting to a similar point but from opposite directions.  


I write code on my surface Pro nearly every day, have for a couple years now.  I started out as an experiment to see if I could replace my 2 desktops (one at work one at home) and 2 laptops.  It turned out to work so well I've stayed with this setup through 3 generations of the Surface .  It also runs three 27" monitors on my desk though, and most of the time I'm using it there with a full keyboard and mouse.  But when I'm travelling it works just fine.


Not only want, the touch interface is pretty useful when I am tunning any interface detail.

But I have to admit that long typing are best conducted with the cover keyboard.


I program all the time on my Surface 3 when I travel. 


This is exactly what Microsoft say they have done: designed surface 4 using surface 3 (but they didn't saw 'in every detail', it was my cruelty note).

I think they were lying, by the way, it would be a great *arena* to beat them.

Edit: typo


I remember one very popular blog post that circulated around which compared the MacBook Pro to the iPad in a clever way with the iPad being made out to seem like the loser. 

Other than that, I feel most coverage was like, "Eh, buy it if you want but it's probably pretty niche. Also, the pencil is $100 bucks so, there's that."


iPads outsold MacBooks too, but that still makes them a companion device so MS is not wrong.

How is the surface pro not powerful enough as a laptop replacement? Do you think the MacBook is a bad laptop? It's much less powerful than a Surface pro 4. Even the MacBook air, (okay I'm not sure which one is more powerful here, I think they are somewhat comparable). A MacBook air or a surface pro is enough of a laptop for like 97% of people who use their computers for Facebook, word processing, school projects, etc. 


> Not quite powerful enough to use as a laptop replacement. 

Huh? It's priced the same and uses similar components to Ultrabooks. I don't understand this.

> But still a little too big to use as a tablet.

Ipad Pro?


Everyone keeps proving my point. The only reason Microsoft still has their foot in the door is because many schools and business' software run on Windows only. Windows is literally their only option. Does it really count as legit sale if that was the users only option?

The reason they don't port their software to other platforms is because it cost $/time. Why fix something that isn't broken?

However, Microsoft has failed on mobile. Schools and businesses have already began creating their once window only applications to more platforms like tablets and phone, which means iOS/android. Not Windows. 

Do u not see Microsoft has peaked, existing Windows software is slowly being ported to iOS/android. & at the same time new software is being written for iOS/android first, & MAYBE they'll also add Windows support. Mobile is primary now. 




Agreed.  Apple makes software for the user, MS for the VP of purchasing.




It's true, the only time I see Microsoft software is at businesses now. 

Like you said, they're forced to use Microsoft because their existing enterprise software was built for Windows. So they're locked in until they rebuild it for something else. 

The only reason they would rebuild it is if new category of pc's come out, which they did, mobile phones. I'm already seeing many companies port their windows apps to iOS apps, or at least add iOS support, an employee who is always plugged In is more likely to produce more. 


>  but I assure the the enterprise market does

Productivity (Photoshop, AutoCAD, etc) and Gaming, sure yes, they do!

But enterprise, no, they don't!

Most current enterprise software runs Java J2EE on servers and clients for Java J2SE or browser-based.




Squares as opposed to squares with rounded corners? 


Reintroduce the Zune - where the squares came from.


As long as the to my have rounded corners, or else...


The fact that you're looking at just the number and only just that one number shows you ARE looking at it in a vacuum. People who actually analyze Microsoft's business (which by the way, means analyzing the market and Microsoft's competitors AKA Apple as well) predicted lower sales and Microsoft surprised on the upside with better figures than expected. But I guess we should defer to your opinion right? How do you think the markets work? That 50 million people at a time are supposed to snap up a product right away?


How can it possibly be that ”professional" when it runs iOS? That's what I don't understand. I'm glad you have uses for it, but a lot of creative professionals don't simply because it runs a mobile OS.


It isn't that large, I guess I should have clarified. 

It's pretty large to use *just* as a media device, especially considering the price.


What's sad is that they used to. For some reason after Android 4.2 Google just gave up and started removing all of the tablet optimisations.


I think the problem there is that they are touting it as a "full pro level art/graphics" tablet with Adobe's help to replace your laptop/desktop whatever. The current app might be good for like 80-90% of regular consumers, but industry folk might opt for a full machine that can take in pen input and do processing like photoshop/illustrator can.


I'm curious how it would have done, were that the case. When it comes down to it, OS X is still a smaller market than the iPad. Would an iPad Pro running a touch-optimized OS X have helped grow the OS X market? It would definitely have drawn in some people, but I think it would also push others away. I know I, at least, wouldn't have bought one, whereas I did buy an iPad Pro on day one.


I had no idea that Adobe After Effects and Media Encoder were legacy apps! 

Who'd a thunk it!

Go back to shitposting in another subreddit. Did /r/Android kick you out already that you're back here? 


Exactly right. Why do these guys want a touch screen and stylus to run software that was never designed for it? Makes zero sense.

Also they can't seem to see that iPP is the kind of hardware that will bring about the revolution and do away with nasty, bloated crap like AE, and replace them far friendlier touch and stylus centric applications.

This is the truth. Any ipad honestly trumps the windows tablet mode (touch enhanced interface) but for an all-in-One device the iPad pro falls drastically short. The ability to switch from tablet to desktop environment on the fly coupled with readily available docking stations allowing you to use the surface as a full desktop computer puts it in a whole different playing field than the iPad pro. I suspect as Microsoft irons out the hardware quirks and continues to improve their tablet mode, that they will increase their market share in the all-in-one device market. 


Lol okay. I really need to unsubscribe from this one point of view sub 


You got stuck in 1996.

All they do now is provoking fanboys and pushing for the brand that pays them.


Definitely try out the different tech. Personally, I write really really small, which Apple's Pencil interpolation does a better job (math formulas with super and sub scripts, etc).

Also, don't trust demo units. It doesn't help that nibs on the demo Surface Pens aren't replace on a regular basis. As a result, over 70% of demo Surface Pens are damaged. Same thing with Apple Pencil, but at least Apple replaces the nibs on a regular basis (might not be the case at Best Buy and other retailors when they start having Apple Pencil demos).


What makes it a flop?


You are absolutely in denial if you insist that the best-selling device of its segment is a flop. Seriously


Considering everyone was shitting on how the iPP was a niche product that only professionals would use and that the surface was easily better? Pretty big margin difference when you realize how those people are arguably the minority.


Then factor in the apps sales... Microsoft's App Store is still light years behind. 


Yeah but, it sucks. 

EDIT

$1,500 for the base model???  With an i5 and 128GB SSD?  In gonna give that a hard "no."  That's even above Apple's ludicrous pricing. 


True, that is how it is being treated. Surfaces can be purchased with laptop allotments but not development funds, while tablets can be. The problem is that a tablet like a maxed out iPad pro with accessories can be bought with those funds but a mid level surface pro which is close in price cannot be because of the difference in licensing fees. If the Surface doesn't want any of the tablet market and is only trying to be a hybrid that's fine I guess. 


I've seen it. My institution has banned all surfaces from purchase with institutional funds for research fellows because of the tacked on licensing fees. They will still buy surfaces for laptop replacement but they have barred a whole section of funds from being used for them.


as in, the DAC is better and more powerful, or the speakers built in are better?


I think A hybrid of OSX and iOS could've been good, but would have stopped a lot of people from buying. Pleasing all the consumers is not an easy thing


What fanboy pants? I'm criticizing how inconsequential your comment is. I didn't take a position on the debate between surface and iPad pro. 


What is Apple's reason for not making a touch version of OSX or a hybrid of both iOS and OSX? I'd love an iPad Pro like that as well. 


> 2 million sales is still a little weak when you realize how many iPhones Apple sells in a quarter, but still good

Compared to how many iPhone Apple sells in a quarter, even the power of the Sun is weak.

2 million of iPad Pro's **only** is a great number!


The only products that sell more than the iPhone are consumables, like bottles of Coke. And the iPhone is trying to catch up, at this point. 


If you're comparing every business to Apple's iPhone cash cow, they're obviously not going to hold a candle.


Maybe it's as powerful as the Core M version, but certainly not the i5 and i7 versions. 


While I'm not arguing that it's a powerful product.  It is a very large difference having a fully operational OS that can run desktop level apps vs one that can only run mobile ones.  


I concede your point at any rate. 


To each their own, but the amount of work I can get done on my SP3 far outweighs what I could do with an iPad Pro.

I don't care about the thinness, but about the pen support in Adobe apps and other drawing apps plus full Windows. 


Don't even try to sell me on a freaking Surface. I had an SP3, preordered it... It was not a good experience and I'm happy to be rid of the dang thing. 


If it's not as good as Android's, it basically doesn't exist. I had a Surface, I know exactly how much of a tablet ecosystem it had. Pretty much none. Most of the stuff was more phone app than tablet app. 


Isn't the market for the pro more likely to be work users needing desktop apps which are plentiful?


Never said they did. I think your brain added the word air to the sentence. 


The thing that trips me up is hitting the goddamn emoji button whenever I really start to get going. 


I just googled it. Holy crap, it's *hidden by default* and you can get it back by long pressing on the taskbar and tapping the option. Does MS actually conduct UX tests with users completely unaware of their UI? This stuff boggles my mind...


I meant to go with the iPad Pro for free


Woudn't an actual ultrabook be better though?  Cheaper, more power, better keyboard, if you buy a MacBook of some flavor you get the best trackpad around.  The Surface isn't nearly the best ultrabook.


[deleted]


Is that with the Surface Pro itself shut off? As far as I've been able to tell, most Intel integrated mobile GPUs can only drive 3 monitors *total*, which includes the laptop (or table) screen itself. 


If people are using and buying iPads more than laptops/desktops, then it isn't a companion device - it's their main device. 

e. damn, surface lovers really like hanging around in /r/apple 


pointing out the ipad pro is not the failure everyone made it out to be is salty? lol ok


My t450s was certainly less expensive than my SP3. And I can expand up to 24 GB of ram and disk space as well. I regret not having gotten 16GB of RAM in the SP3.

> Ipad Pro?

Yes. Ipad Pro is too big to use as a tablet.

And to be fair my SP3 critique is of a device that I do own and have a good deal of trouble integrating into my work/play style. 

At work I have a desktop and a laptop (which I actually use as my development machine). I bring my SP3 in and use that for meetings and when I go to help a coworker with a problem.

At home I mostly don't use it. I don't really spend a lot of time on the sofa but if I do I find the SP3 too heavy for extended usage. It is good for ordering food and quick emails.

Those caveats aside, the SP3 is one of my favorite devices. It is really an incredible machine. 


The issue is that the VP of purchasing isn't necessarily buying windows 10 when XP is still working.


Yeah, porting app to iOS is great, until you need to run financial reports, put stats data from one data base to another, process large amounts of credit card transaction, have access to the Global Distribution System to book and manage hundreds passenger booking details.

There are some things you just cannot do on the move, that you need to be at a desk for and need desktop programming to achieve.  And this is most of the boring 9-5 office jobs in the world.  not everyone has a job where they can swan around sitting in parks with their tablets and sitting in Starbucks with their Macbooks 


Most now runs on .Net and accessible from any browser.

That's not to say that J2EE doesn't have a large foothold, but the tides shifted away a decade ago.


.Net is huge in the enterprise. In par with Java at this point. 


With you know wallpapers, a dock, different looks for each app. Then don't get me started on the rest of the terrible UX. The list style menus. You'll be scrolling down through the natural movement of your thumb makes the phone switch to the list beside the one your on, and then the OS is so dumb when you flip back you're back at the top of the list.

That entire OS was a scramble to find something usable after KIN and Windows OS6.


I always thought of it as a minimalist less confusing [KIN Two](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/phones/24157-xlarge/Microsoft-KIN-TWO-Review-Design-008.jpg) or [KIN](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/29849-image/Microsoft-Kin-One-05.jpg)


Again, you could say the same of a MacBook. Larger than an iPhone to use in bed and with prices at around $1,000+, it's a lot for people that just watch YouTube and Netflix 


Funny the people I know who are using it are basically a split between "big" ipad users and pro art people.  The pro art people seem to REALLY like it even with the limits.  I'm sure a part of that is that all the existing solutions really aren't actually all that great.


Windows 10 has both a tablet and desktop mode. It is the one major thing I think Microsoft did spot on for tablet development. You can easily switch the surface to tablet mode and all applications can be managed with tiles through the start screen. If you need a desktop environment you switch it back to desktop mode and it has the full windows desktop environment you would find on any laptop or desktop PC. In my opinion the surface really can be used as an all in one device. Plenty of power, plus you can purchase docking stations to have all of your peripherals hooked in to use it like a standard computer, then when you want a tablet you take it off your dock and use the touch optimized interface. I was really hoping for something similar from the pro but no such luck. Until Intel gets a better grip on the mobile/IoT market I doubt we'll be seeing an OSX enabled ipad. 


And as it stands they have a huge lead making their flagship operating system tablet friendly. There are still no Apple laptops with touch screen. And I'm not really sure there are any indications these factors will change.


The amount of Apple hate on /r/Apple is pretty high, so I'm not sure what single point of view you think this sub has.


/u/L43 was specifically talking about reviews done by those "in graphics". There have been a lot of pro illustrators (and similar) doing iPad Pro + Pencil reviews. They're very different from the typical "tech journalism" review.


yeah i noticed the worn pen tips on surfaces i've tried!
unfortunately, the ipad pro isnt really an option for me. I will definitely try it out just to see how the pen feels in size as well as on the tablet. i doubt any tablet on this planet can make my writing easier on the eyes though ;)

There's no argument there, but that's not what the discussion was about?


Yeah, and admittedly, Microsoft licensing is the **worst**.

You've got licensing questions with BYOD, if X covers, if Y invalidates X, you've got O365, blah blah blah

Honestly (lol) I wish they would clean up all of their licensing stuff before worrying about making hardware - and I like the Surface!


4 speaker setup. 


It would have to be like boot camp. You can if you want but most people never do. 


Microsoft is not "struggling to sell" the Surface Pro.


I'm no expert, but I feel Apple has a very specific distinction between tablets and desktop/laptop computers. They feel they have different use cases and the operation systems reflect it.

If Apple made one operating system for all devices exactly the way Windows is merging their computers and phones and Xbox OS's, but with the high level of polish.. Man. It would glue the whole Apple experience together much more, especially since the processors used for the iPhone and iPad are incredible now. They can easily handle heavy workloads. The only issue I can see would be dispersing heat in the thin devices.


But the Apple Watch also sold estimated about 3 million in its first quarter so I figured iPad (an already established product) would have higher sales by now, even though it's a first gen for the 'pro' line 


Idk the stats comparison but I feel like i remember hearing that it was approaching the lower clocked i5's (air, surface pro) but I don't know 


The iPad Pro has Pencil support and Adobe has been releasing suites, and will continue developing more especially with the iPad Pro's powerful hardware and increased ram. 

Full windows is just kinda a blanket statement that doesn't really mean much overall, there are a few benefits but overall it's still windows and I don't like windows. It depends which features you use frequently. The iPadOS is getting extra focus as of last year, so that'll only get better and better. It's already probably 75% of the way to being able to replace my Mac. OS X is much more useful than Windows as a pure OS, so probs more like 80-85% of the way to being able to replace windows for my uses. 


I'm not a fan of it lol, I'm just saying why its fans are fans of it. It would be a waste of money for me. 

My tablet (iPad Air) is a better tablet than it. My computer (rMacBook pro 13) is a better computer than it. 


I'm trying to figure out why the Surface is included in these discussion to begin with. It is not an ARM OS. It runs Windows which no matter how you feel about it is 100 times more capable.


Well, the pen and keyboard *should* make it better for note taking and email, but having to spend more to get both those accessories is a bummer. 

Though I don't have one, it feels like having 2 iPad airs in one machine. 


That's because the keyboard more often than not invokes itself when needed. Its only on very rare occasions in some legacy desktop apps that it doesn't


This is why when I get a new system with a new OS I spend too much time glancing through all the settings, preferences, and such. Always something somewhere to turn off or on that can make a huge difference. 

Overall I find Win10 to be fun but MS still needs to do a lot of work with it. I guess since their Surface tablets offer keyboards that MS really didn't work that hard with the virtual keyboard. I find iOS virtual keyboard so nice and functional that I rarely use my BT physical keyboard with it. I've only used the Win10 virtual keyboard twice and both times I hated it because of some little overlooked detail. Kinda like trackpads, I love Apple trackpads but find most others a pain to use, either too sensitive for taps or wanting to zoom/pinch when I'm trying to merely scroll.


> with the iPad Pro for free

Nothing included is included "for free". If they included, either of those, it is included as part of the cost. The issue is that not everyone wants the keyboard OR the pencil -- they just want the iPad. If Apple included the keyboard, those people would complain that there wasn't a cheaper option that did not include the keyboard -- they really would not see it as being included "as free" because it really isn't. It is just included with the price.


Why? Apple would lose money. 


> Woudn't an actual ultrabook be better though? Cheaper, more power, better keyboard, if you buy a MacBook of some flavor you get the best trackpad around. The Surface isn't nearly the best ultrabook.

Surface has great build quality and it's really light. As for keyboards, lots of good mechanical keyboards around, if you don't like the type cover for some reason (better than the Macbook keyboard in my view). It's not that much more expensive than ultrabooks in its class, and just as powerful (maybe less RAM). Screen's amazing too.

Battery life is a much bigger concern than anything you've mentioned.

And should we start talking about what else can the SP4 do?


I replaced my Ultrabook with an SP4 and I've never looked back. If all you want is a laptop, then sure, an ultrabook like the XPS 13 would also work well. But the SP4 is far more versatile than any ultrabook. The kickstand makes it an absolute pleasure to use as a tablet or even when just doing some technical reading/annotation. My SP4 is lighter as a tablet (without the type cover) than my iPad 2 with a case to allow it to be used in an angled position. 

I code on my SP4, I read ebooks on it, I annotate academic papers, I watch Netflix, I take notes in One Note, I Photoshop and I process all my DSLR pictures in Lightroom (lightning fast due to SSD and USB 3.0). With no hitch whatsoever. With it, I finally have something ultra light and portable that serves as a single device that I can take with me when I travel with no compromises. 

If you don't need the versatility of the Surface devices, then obviously it doesn't make sense to get one.  But many people don't seem to realize this. If you truly must have a laptop, then get one. The Surface wasn't designed for you, and that's okay.


And /u/TagaKain is saying the mobile app is nowhere close to the real thing. You're comparing Mindstorm and Duplo.


I use a USB 3 dual display adapter to drive two of them.  The third runs off the surfaces displayport output.  The surface display is still active and actually I set it in front of my keyboard but below the monitors (so I can reach it) and use it as a sort of extra monitor/touch input device.

The monitors on the USB display controller probably aren't useful for gaming at all, but for work or video they work great.  I expected it would suck somehow, but honestly I had to think about how I have them hooked up when you asked, they work so well I forgot all about it.


No, it just means that planned obsolescence/growth is more prevalent in mobile devices since the desktop sphere has reached saturation.
You are just moving goalposts at this point.

Think about it, many people replace smartphones each year, but a 5 year old laptop runs just fine for most tasks.


Not so fast. Are phones people's main devices?

> My t450s was certainly less expensive than my SP3. And I can expand up to 24 GB of ram and disk space as well. I regret not having gotten 16GB of RAM in the SP3.

Well, is that Thinkpad an ultrabook? Let me be clear, I use a Thinkpad too, what I'm saying is that the SP is priced and configured like its competitors. 

> And to be fair my SP3 critique is of a device that I do own and have a good deal of trouble integrating into my work/play style.

I think it's because you have a desktop and a laptop, you essentially have three devices that can do the similar things. No wonder you'd find the SP3 a bit redundant. 

I've used a SP3 as well, but I won't get a laptop *and* a SP3.  If anything, I'm hoping to replace my Thinkpad with the new SP4.





Good for those users then.


> That's not to say that J2EE doesn't have a large foothold, but the tides shifted away a decade ago.

What?

Java is the main language for enterprise software. .NET is big, but not as big as Java!

It is about Half and Half for the professional artists I know. My wife works in Graphic Design and I have a few friends at Cartoon Network and Floyd County Productions (the people who do Archer). They do like the iPad Pro but wish it was more Professional. In the end they really want a Surface like OS X Mac Product.




I have a sp2 with Win10. The tablet mode doesn't make win32 apps run any more tablet like, and there are still very few compelling "metro" apps.


Making that jump to an all-in-one OS instead of splitting into 2 different OS's (apples OSX/iOS, googles chrome/android) is definitely a gamble but seeing the trends with making a device that can replace your desktop tower (should you still own one...) your laptop, AND your tablet all with one device is definitely a forward thinking and promising prospect. 


>The amount of Apple hate on /r/Apple is pretty high

The amount of hate Apple received in /r/apple for all its recent product launches is still lower than that in the rest of Reddit, however.


For real graphics designers, I've seen them preferring the iPad Pro.


I forgot to mention. I have one huge issue with the Apple Pencil. The Apple Pencil lacks an erase/button. 

If you're using the Apple Pencil to take notes in class, you'll have to crossing things out. It simply takes too much time to select the eraser then go back to inking, especially in a course that has you jotting notes constantly.


[deleted]


The SP4 and SB were also both new products and that was their first quarter as well


It's definitely a big part of it though. Tablet sales are of course plenty of profit but, those tablets are truly vehicles for sustained micro transactions in the form of apps. Even if Microsoft outsold the Surface over the iPad, they wouldn't be getting nearly the cut that Apple gets from app sales for their iPads. 


I didn't say they were. I said that pointing out that some people like the surface computers while others don't is not a worthwhile comment to make. It's true of basically everything and tells you nothing relevant to the discussion being had. 

I don't know how you're not getting this. My comment has nothing to do with the Surface or iPad. It has to do with the quality of the comment you made. 


The Pro and associated accessories have not been available for very long. Furthermore, iPad sales have been declining for quite a while. 


I have a surface 3. It's a smaller underpowered surface pro. I love the thing. I also own a spec'd out Thinkpad and an iPad. The surface 3 has replaced both devices. It helps that I'm a student and use the pen every day with One Note. It runs Office just fine and I even have MatLab and Python installed on it for when I need to write code on the go. It certainly doesn't feel as premium as my iPad but is FAR more useful for me (an engineering college student).

I think the people that hate it are expecting it to be something it's not. It's not a very good tablet if that's all you want. It's also not a very powerful laptop if that's what you need. But it's replaced 10 pounds worth of spirals and another 5lbs of Thinkpad in my backpack. I literally just carry the surface and some spare engineering paper and pens. 


I read that weirdly. Anyway, I found that for a lot of purposes the iPad Air 2 I got after the Surface was actually a better computer than it. At least it never bluescreened on me, or somehow lost its WiFi chip, or any of a bunch of other things that invariably happened during a time crunch. :/ and most of them had mysteriously resolved themselves by the time I was able to call Microsoft support. Even the ones that had been happening consistently for 24 hours beforehand. 


Don't forget the MacBook 12. In terms of day to day usability (for me at least) it runs circles around my old SP3.


Well, chipset or OS does not factor in when we are talking about the "form" of the device.  

Just like those Asus Intel phones.  Nobody really doubts that those are phones lol.


I definitely agree that the software is more capable on an academic level. To my personal experience, in practice, it's somewhat less capable due to sheer lack of reliability. But that's not really why. 

It's just a matter of form factor. If someone wants a roughly laptop capable device in a tablet form factor, these are the devices they're considering. And also the Pixel C gets a pass in because it was almost useful even though it actually isn't. Does anyone know if you could at least run Ubuntu on the thing?


Right. "Legacy" apps like Firefox or Excel or whatever have you. It's not that the keyboard *never* comes up, it just does it when it feels like doing so, like, say, about 50%. I can change the focus to something else, tap back and forth 2-3 times and then suddenly it comes up. Mind you, this is a 2800 dollar Vaio Canvas Z with much higher specs than a Surface Pro. 

Then, there's an even bigger problem (because the keyboard thing I can solve with tapping a button now): The window doesn't scale, so the keyboard hides elements behind it. Sometimes this means that I can't actually see what I'm typing because the input element is at the bottom of a page, and Windows of course isn't smart enough to automatically change the window height for me.


I see the point in this, thank you.


Sure, carrying around a mechanical keyboard, "not that much more expensive", "just as powerful but less RAM".  A lot of caveats there that aren't present with... an actual ultrabook.  The Surface is a device of compromises.  Maybe those compromises align with your needs.  That's great!  But they don't for most people, which is why it's not really suitable for a mass market device.


Nobody was comparing anything at all. The comment was that the surface pro can run full photoshop *and* the mobile app, so you have both choices, whereas an iPad can *only* run the mobile app. 

Point being, even if you want to argue that the mobile app is better because it's touch optimized, the surface still has access to it. At least, that's how I read it. 


For a lot of people, yes. My wife hasn't touched her computer in nearly a decade now. She uses her phone for email, web browsing, Skype calls to Thailand, videos, music, etc. She did our taxes on her phone.


Phones are in their own category. People tend to have phones in addition to laptop/tablet/desktop.


nice attempt to put words in my mouth, I didn't say anywhere that the surface was a failure 


These are all fair criticisms. I should have prefaced that my opinion was based on my particular ownership.

> I'm hoping to replace my Thinkpad with the new SP4.

My only advice is to buy more RAM than you imagine needing. 

But also, [this](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Top-10-Ultrabooks.91067.0.html) and  [this](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T450s-Ultrabook-Review.137248.0.html).


Why isn't iOS worth the price? So paying more for an OS I and millions of people don't want would make it worth the price? Bad memory management, antivirus software, shitty unoptimized apps, fans revving up and the surface getting hot. That's worth it? Or take away all that overhead and give me a simple yet powerful system I can do what I want with. Edit a video? There's an app for that. Watching a lecture and take notes? I can do that. Write long papers and draft documents? I can do that on iPad. 

So I'm not sure why you'd make this sort of all encompassing "iPad isn't worth the price" comment like it's supposed to be absolute. I had a MacBook and an iPad and ended up selling my MacBook because I used it so little. How did a "full desktop OS" make my everyday life experience better?


Graphic Designers will benefit from the iPad Pro when Affinity publishes their iOS applications. 

For now the only group that really love and benefit from the ipAd pro are illustrators and 2D digital artists, as the accuracy of the iPad pro and the abundance of 2D painting applications make the iPad Pro shine like no others. 

Sure you don't get Photoshop, but believe me when I say I don't miss Photoshop that much. 


For general apps like native Microsoft apps I've been pretty content with the touch interfacing on my SO's SP4. If you're running a desktop app of course it's not going to be touch enhanced, you can't blame the device because the 3rd party developer made it for a desktop environment and the device you're using can run it. Thats like complaining that my iPhone screws up when I visit a website that has no mobile view and I have to use the desktop version. Windows tablets are becoming increasingly popular (not just MS but multiple other hardware manufacturers as well) so it's only a matter of time until more tablet friendly interfaces start emerging.

>  pointing out that some people like the surface computers while others don't is not a worthwhile comment to make

It is worthwhile when the person he replied to said people do not want that.


If you aren't comparing the Surface to gravy flavored ice cream, you aren't saying Microsoft is struggling to sell Surfaces, then just what the fuck did you even make [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/43p6nb/apples_ipad_pro_outsells_microsoft_tablets_in/czk2iq6) for? It is a terrible analogy for the situation if you aren't comparing any of that to what we are discussing. Talk about pointless comments...


I know about the decline, I still thought the sales were much higher 


Here's the thing though, regarding "people expecting it to be something it's not"

If it had good tablet apps, and a good tablet OS and ui with the full windows features, and it was all well blended, and was both a great computer and great tablet experience, it would be a great product. 

I don't think it's fair to say Microsoft can't be expected to make the tablet part decent. I think it's fair to say that it's a decent compact computer, so if you don't care about the tablet part, it's good enough. But you make it sound like this is what the product should be, and it's the best it can be. 

The iPad Pro is going to be what it should be. Build up the features and apps from the ground up with modern ui and code, and have a nice touch optimized interface that also has equal features to a 'full' OS at least for 95% of use cases. 

Over time, with the iPad Pro's hardware, and Apple's focus on the iPad software starting last year, that is what will happen. Then the iPad will be a functional powerhouse with a touch ui and the whole thing will be intuitive, easy to use, and useful. It's already fairly useful to be clear but it needs a few more obvious things, and a lot more less obvious things but that'll come in time. 


That experience sounds consistent with mine with any PC I've used since I was born


I disagree. It's a weaker machine without support for writing and drawing. 


I mean, I find OS X vastly superior as an OS, but the performance is definitely not comparable with the surface pro's i5. However, you're referring to the surface 3, non pro? I forget what the specs of it are 


Form is a cheap insult because no one is actually talking about form ... ever. They're always talking about capability. Even when they think they aren't they're talking about what it can do for them.


>  almost useful even though

I guess that's the source of my question. How is iOS any more capable than Android?

I understand that you or another person might find a specific app more useful that's only available on one of the two questioned ecosystems but both devices have almost identical capabilities. This is not true for the Surface as it is in every way 100 times more capable. 


Don't get me wrong -- there are SOME things that just "standard" and should be included at the price regardless of what people want. There are lots of examples of things that become standard in vehicles -- such as air bags (before they became required were already mass-adopted across the industry) and rearview camera while backing up (which is in almost every new vehicle since the 2015 models, for example). I'm sure there are still people, however, that ask if there is an option without those features because they don't want to pay extra for them.

An argument could be made that 16GB as the base-line storage option on a lot of iOS devices is well-over-due for a bump-up.


My original comment was that the iPad Pro was expensive for being mainly a media device, and then you brought up a Macbook for a comparison, which most people(that I know of, at least) use for more than just a media device.

It's cool you like iOS on the iPad Pro, but for people/professionals that Apple is marketing for(hence the PRO in the name), iOS doesn't cut it.

Sorry if I came off as harsh, I'm not trying to be, and if I sounded mean, I apologize.


I'm really looking forward to seeing Affinity's iPad offerings.


>you can't blame the device because the 3rd party developer made it for a desktop environment and the device you're using can run it. 

But that's the problem. The Windows ecosystem is all Win32 apps, which are not tablet apps. The good tablet apps are few and far between and hard to find. There are gems out there, but nothing compared to what is available for the iPad.

Jesus Christ, this isn't that complicated.

Gravy flavoured ice cream is something that you and I can both agree would not be a great product. And yet, comments like "It is absolutely what lots of people want. It isn't what everyone wants" would still be true. 

So I'm not comparing the Surface to gravy ice cream. I'm not comparing the iPad to gravy ice cream. I'm contrasting the extreme scenarios (in terms of products) for which your comments are true to show just how little important information can be derived from comments like "It is absolutely what lots of people want. It isn't what everyone wants". 

This is so not hard to understand. 


I was using a computer I had built myself before hand, and then tried messing around with alternative OSes until it wouldn't boot into anything unless you were holding three different keys during start up, but I still feel like that thing had fewer problems than the Surface. 

But anyway, sorry to trouble you, have a good day. :)


In terms of raw number crunching sure the MacBook is a much slower machine. For single threaded tasks (most common laptop usage) and all of the coding I do on it, it flies. The time differentials between it and my i7 SP3 are fractions of seconds. (That's different for large projects, but the main bottleneck on both machines is disk io)

The UX differences (and OS X in general) make me choose to use the MacBook over the surface always. 

Edit: and really the perf *is* comparable (for single threaded tasks) http://www.anandtech.com/show/9136/the-2015-macbook-review/9

It in fact beats the SP3 in several benchmarks: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9136/the-2015-macbook-review/10


Yeah, it's almost entirely down to specific apps. Android doesn't have a audio processing chain API like Audiobus, but that wasn't even developed by Apple, it was hacked in by the makers of Audiobus. Similar story with Workflows. 

Workflows is interesting because it's very similar to AppleScript, it can process data through different applications like a macro. Android has only very limited forms of automation like IFTTT, from what I remember. But IFTTT can set and launch from triggers, where Workflows have to be manually triggered, or triggered from another app that monitors something and supports launching workflows if certain things happen. 

What Windows gains in capability it quickly loses in inconvenience. The hardware is never as reliable, updates take ages and never manage to happen while you aren't looking, there are very few capable computers smaller than a Surface, and none can match the performance to size ratio of an iPad Mini 4. And if it is portable, and even somewhat powerful, the battery life tends to intervene before it can be too convenient. My switch to iOS as my primary operating system felt downright liberating, despite some of the compromises. At least I knew my devices would be there, working, and ready when I needed them. I hadn't ever felt that before. 


That's a harsh comparison given the age of the iOS ecosystem vs the Win tablet based ecosystem. Admittedly there is still low support for tablet oriented windows apps but the market is growing and windows 10 being sold in more and more tablets means that the demand for touch oriented windows applications is growing. The major advantage Microsoft currently has is their steps forward for a hybrid OS instead of segregating their tablet and desktop environments. Currently the tablet market is dominated by iOS but with more pushes for an all-in-one device Microsoft is ahead of the curve in integration. They still have a long way to go if they truly want to compete with pre-existing tablet OS's though (iOS and android).

iPad ULTRA Release Date and Price  - NEW 14 INCH MODEL IN 2024!!


Would you be interested in a LARGER iPad?
I’m holding out until iPad mini fold.
i like the ipad 14.1 and plan to buy one
don't put a camera on it don't do it don't do it
current ipad pro cant even take advantage of the m2 chip
I say NO to dynamic island on iPad!
I actually would buy the iPad Ultra next year. 😅
I am waiting for new invention….
I hope apple make ipad m3 run Xcode app
That will be amazing 
Giveaway ❤🎉 🤞🏻🫰🏻
Hey! Thanks for the video. I definitely need the new Ipad Ultra!
Appreciate all you work keeping us up to date. Got a 15 Pro Max and loving it. Wife is still sporting the 13 Plus for now.  I am really looking forward to update my iPad Pro 4th generation 😊
Hello, how are you, (I don't know English, I use Google translator and sorry if I'm wrong). The equipment that I would like to buy in December 2023 or in 2024 would be an iPhone 15 pro Max, which I would like, but I don't have the resources to buy it for myself. Maybe I could buy an iPhone 11 pro Max or a normal Samsun Galaxy 21 for December and in 2024 those are my plans. Right now I use a normal Samsung Galaxy s7
Larger would be better
Bring that 14" with thinner bezels, better for drawing, gaming, & watching content. Samsung is ahead in that department. Now, if they're planing to include the dynamin island to the iPad, i'm the change to the Samsung tab S9 since it has that clean screen, unless apple makes magic by including the dynam island but hide it when is not in use.
I need myself a new 12.9 inch iPad pro! 14 inch iPad ultra sounds nice…if I had an extra arm and leg to sell… 😢
Looking to replace my apple watch this year and most likely a new iMac.  Yes, I still like to sit at my desk and work. I also have my iPad pro that goes everywhere with me.  This new Ultra iPad may be a little out of my price range; Also, it may be a little larger than what I would want to carry with me all the time.
In 2024 I am planning to buy the iPad ultra in addition I am thinking to buy an iPhone 15 since I still have iPhone XS.
I will be getting the apple ring if it comes out.
What is absolutely amazing….
No notch!!! If Apple does such a stupid thing as putting a notch on an iPad -which still has plenty of space in the bezel area for the camera/etc, then they’ll. Lose a ton of sales. Tablets need to be a full screen with an uninterrupted display. Dynamic Island is fine as a software only implementation, much like the floating home button that iPads have had forever and can be turned on in the settings. But do not put a horrid looking notch in the display area when the bezel has plenty of room for it!
I plan to buy an Airpods Max 2, if it finally getting released
iPad ultra 😊
please no island please no island please no island… 🙏🏼
I am hoping to buy the equipment for audio recording and production, the hardware and software. Since i have the best experience with Apple i will try to work on those devices. My phone is the XS max right now and i hope it keeps working a while longer, but i do not think apple is the only way to go. The new Google phone seems to be a great device and i always try to balance my fangirl with my brain😂, so lets hope i can afford what i will need, and not everything breaks at the same time 😢
Get rid of the wall gardened, digital prison, gatekeeping monopoly App store iPadOS

Have the iPad Pro M3 run full blown MacOS.
well they have to play catch up with something!
All those power in a slab, for what? IpadOS is limited to movile applications.. unless if it dual boot with MacOS
A dynamic island on an ipad would be so ridiculous. The reason why the dynamic island exists on iPhones is because the bezel is so small, it cannot fit the camera and sensor. That’s not the case on an iPad where the bezel is large enough to fit the camera. So unless an iPad has a bezel of 3mm, a dynamic island is a dumb idea.
I’m looking forward to the new 14” iPad.  I need that and a MBP :-/
I love Ipad, but wish I could purchase it for my studies
I will try to get an Ipad, if I get scolership. Because it's best for students.
hello I follow you from France, I was impatiently waiting for your video on the new iPad pro I plan to buy it. have a good day 😄
Planning on getting me a Samsung phone before the end of the yr.
A 14” iPad, being only essentially 1” larger than current 12.9” model, is underwhelming and not enough of a differentiation from the 12.9” version. How lame to bring it out just to compete with the Samsung model. If we are expected to pay considerably more for this “Ultra”, then it better be a 16” version. Also, I’d like to see an iPad Studio version with either 24” or 27”, meant for creative users at the desktop, and with an optional adjustable stand. And, really, for these expensive “ professional” iPads, there should be much better iPadOS or, we can dream, MacOS, operating systems with full filing systems and more Thunderbolt ports for connectivity/storage options. Not the restricted, tepid OS/software options we see with today’s iPads.
Great video! I'm planning on getting the new Ipad Pro when it's out in 2024, never had a tablet till now, excited to use one! ^_^
I’m definitely going to be getting the new iPad mini whenever they announce it
My 2018 12.9 iPP needs an update. Now thanks to this video I will wait for the ultra it seems.
Hi ! I am holding out for the 14” iPad, hopefully in the Spring ! I love all things Apple but I do not have an iPhone right now. I went cheap and got a galaxy. Big disappointment !
Hopefully I’ll be buying the 14” iPad ultra in 2024!!!
I also would like a bigger iPad and iMac computer for the home.
I want the apple car and the apple glasses
I will buy a new ipad. 
Thanks for  your videol
My $3000 flagship mBP already had a magsafe port and usb-c port go bad in less than 1 year. Apple isnt what it used to be.
I am plannig to buy 15 pro max by the end of the year, my current phone is iphone 8.
I intrnd to buy in 2024 the last and largerst iPad 😊
Hi Matt, after this video I am quite tempted to purchase the New IPad Ultra.
I will be getting new iPad when they come out
I bought iPad Pro this year when Apple
Staff said they have not heard about iPad  ULTRA ridiculous I will have to trade in IPad Pro I bought in July
Will wait for your iPhone 15
Just another speculation video for the views = $ 👎
Yes , definitely if I can use it as multifunctional.. I would love to see it and how they’ll work. And am planning on getting an iPhone 13 mini this year though and want to win this time giveaway.. thank you
Yup, me wants one of those, or any kind of iPad, I just think that they might be perfect to work with, especially if you're constantly on the move and need something easy to use, relaiable and fast!
iPhone 15 pro max is an option
Apple Vision Pro, M3 Max MacBook Pro, etc.
In 2024, if it does release ill definetely try to get the iPhone SE4. From the leaks and rumors it appears to be the best value iPhone Apple has released in a while. The ipad ultra also seems very interesting though
I’m highly motivated to purchase the IPad Ultra, either 14 or 16 inch! Thank you for the updates.
I'm waiting for the iPAD Ultra!16 inch would be preferred but the 14 would be excellent as well. Excited to hear your updates today!
I will buy a Macbook pro m3pro !!
I am hoping that the ultra does happen as I want to buy a larger ipad next year for digital planning but if not then I will likely buy a 1 tb 12.9 inch next year after the new ones are released.
14in might be a bit heavy for ipad with magic keyboard, at least 12.9in with mk is heavy as hell
iPad 9th, iPad 10th, MBA 13 m1
I have type 2 diabetes and I've been hanging in with my Watch Series 8 and waiting for a blood glucose sensor to be introduced. Regardless of price, it will be less expensive than paying over $200 a month for CGM sensors...
Im still dreaming to have an apple device or an iPhone 15 pro max 🤔 in the end of the year or next year hope im the lucky one😁✌️ its big help for me to create a very good content like yours 😅
Hey email is never as good as texting now that android may soon be able to get info from us.  I just bought the 15pro max, and the iPad ultra or min iPad Pro 11-12 will be bought in 2024.  Plus waiting for glucose watch have a 7 and want an ultra.  My wife has a 10X and she would love the give away 15 i have a 1TB model she will not need as much.  How do you communicate.  305. Then 619 then possibly 0201 is my best text.  I have been a customer of Mac since 1983 owned over 93 apple hardware units and every laptop and desktop they have ever made.  Event Printers including a “dot Mattrix”
I would like to buy the new 14-inch  M3 Max apple macbook Pro on space black. It looks stunning !!!
I like your youtube channel, please keep us informed. Thanks !!!
Currently, I’m on a 15 inch MacBook Air and  seems to be seems too big for portability. I am  most definitely intrigued  by the luxuriousness of having a 15 inch display. I love you 12.9 machine and a few more years to come.
Nice video
I would be waiting to see if there’s any utility for Apple Vision Pro and if it’s gonna be a game changer. Might consider being an adopter in 24 or 25.
In thinking about the iPad mini!
Would really like to get a M3 Mac this year :)
Planning on getting the newest iPad Pro 12.9" 256gb or 512gb models.
Definitely planning to get a iPAD in 2024 -- hopefully this will be the ultra with OLED and thinner bezels
I want to buy Apple Watch Ultra 2 hope I win iPhone 15 pro max
I’m planning to buy a new iPad Pro (if released) next year. I currently have an iPad Pro 2020 11 inch and i would like to upgrade to a larger screen. And yes, an iPhone would be reall nice!!! 🎉
It will be the Studio Display
I’m planning on buying a M3 MacBook Pro 16inch! Love your videos by the way. In desperate need for a new phone fyi 😉
Love a larger IPad in 2024.
I can hardly wait for the larger iPad (14 inch or more) mainly for my sheet music app
I currently have the M2 12.9" iPad Pro - but as a musician and having an even bigger screen for apps like ForScore on iPadOS would be amazing - stoked for 14" or even bigger!
im planning on buying a maxxed out 16” macbook pro this month, and definitely a new bigger ipad when they release!
Still running my 2018 iPad Pro 12.9” and happy with it. If Apple can offer something worth upgrading to (and something that doesn’t require a second mortgage to buy) I’d go for it. Gotta be more than just a faster chip - I don’t run into any apps that choke on my current CPU, so faster chips… meh.
As a laptop replacement, yes.
New IPad Pro
Yes 	‘d love to buy the 14 in!!!
Matt talks rumors (or bullshit, depending on your point of view) … each day a new one. Seems he needs the clicks for his YouTube income.
I wish Apple would just give the iMacs a touch screen with apple pencil compatibility, and make it mountable, similar to MS Studio or Wacom.
Of course iPhones 15 Pro Max
I would love to see an iPad with macOS. Would definitely buy in 2024!
After seeing this review, definitely thinking about upgrading my m2 iPad Pro for the m3 pro iPad ultra when it releases
Im waiting for the AirPods Max 2
Want to buy IP Ultra 16 in
If i could use it as a display attatched to my macbook pro without any latency or resolution issues, i'd be very sold on a larger ipad.
I'm hoping to get an apple pencil 2 for my ipad pro because I badly need it for my multimedia art studies because its harder to draw with your hands than with a pencil 😂
I hope to buy the new SE in 2024 (if it comes out ) because i have the SE 3 and it is a disappointment but at least it works! Keep up the good work!!
Would like to buy new iPhone for my wife!
definitely planing on getting  some airpods pro early next year
Absolutely!
I’m thinking of buying a new Apple Watch.
I'm going to buy iPad ultra or the top M3 chip. I really need it.
love you from Bangladesh🇧🇩🇦🇪
I’m looking to purchase a new ipad, likely the air
Very Interesting... but  why is there no OLED-Display  in IPAD-Ultra? Lets wait what Apple will show in Early 2024. Thanks for your Video... (Dream of a bigger IPad... 😉) . 🙂👍
Is it still iPad os? If so still garbage
I can wait to get it, specially with the keyboard, together with the Apple pen. Ready to start saving for it..
I would be happy with an ipad
I"really wonder"😒🙄 why the iPad pro doesn't run Mac os.... Seems like a crazy idea, but since they run the same chip why limit your capabilities instead of making you buy a tablet and laptop...? Oh wait nvm., I know why. 🤦‍♂️
If only I could afford one 😔
I just bought a MB M3 Pro. No additional purchases planned near term.
Appe watch Xmas present to myself to lose the weight from Xmas 😂
my next purchase will be a 14 inch iPad ultra to replace my old iPad
I would love to get the new iPad Pro/ultra when it comes out
Definitely looking forward to getting myself a new iPad Pro!
I have been sing a 12.9 Inch from 2022 for Like 2 months and I have to say an even bigger one would seriously be to big… Sometimes the 12.9 feels already to big
I love iPad ultra
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 HI! This year i am planning to buy the Rog flow X16, it is a very light yet powerful laptop with an amazing 1000nite mini led display 🤤 ❤❤❤❤❤, I can’t wait to get my little finger on IT!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m planning to buy a new iPad when it drops and I’m getting a new phone soon as well
Samsung A54 5G next year .
Really excited about this giveaway. If I had the chance, I'd love to get my hands on an ipad mini 7 (if they plan of updating it) or the new iPhone 15 pro max. Always wanted to join the Apple ecosystem. Keep up the awesome content, Matt!
Apple Vision Pro
I want to buy Iphone 15 Pro Max I always want it.
I am so interested in the new iPad Pro Ultra. I would most definitely own that.
I want m3 mini pro, I have 11” M1 Pro, I want smaller
the newest ipad
Great video! What I would get is Iphone 15 Pro or Pro Max because I've been with the same mid quality (when I bought it) Samsung for probably 5 - 6 years and I really need an upgrade now
Holding out until next year for a new ipad
Iam going to buy new ipad pro 🎉🎉
I would try to get Samsung galaxy M55 5g... I'm using Asus Max Pro m2 since 2018 ✌🏼🌱
I would definitely love to get that new iPad. It looks so amazing!
I have been waiting for this new bigger iPad Pro. So I will be buying this for producing art.
Let's go for ipad pro... anyway I have already a 11" m2 Ipad Pro... But still love to received that iphone, haha... I don't even owned any I phone. Only in my dreams hahaha😅
That's a beast. I love my iPad mini 6. However, I'd be interested in this.
I was thinking that I'd like macOS but tbh ipad OS does everything I need as an OS and I prefer the iOS app prices over those of windows or macOS.
iPhone 15 Pro Max  looks like a worthy purchase. Let's see, I haven't bought it yet...
Apple ultra watch2
If I had a choice I would love to have an iPad Ultra for drawing and a Mac mini m3 for everything else.
Please, Jesus, Mary and Joseph do not put the goddamn dynamic island on that thing. That looks HORRENDOUS. Tablets need some bezels, so just hide the face id there instead of disrupting the screen. even a notch would be more forgiveable than the dynamic island.
Apple vision for sure
Hi Matt, I think I am going to break down and go for the IPad Pro 12.9 for classes starting in January. I’d love to wait for the Ultra, but just can’t wait that long. Still, I am sure it will be great.
I was really into purchasing an iPad. Although, I don't want to buy it now, as Apple might release new version of it, and I'm kinda the newest guy)
The camera placement is ugly
I am waiting for the new IPad Mini...
I’m looking 👀 to get the next iPad ultra or pro.
I’m good with the 11” and M3 Pro? I get using the current M series chip because that just makes supply chain sense but seriously, I’m using an A12X and it’s fine.
Wow!!!!! Great video!!! 🎉🎉🎉 iPhone 15 pro max giveaway entry 🎉🎉🎉  please pick me.
it sounds like it wants to be like a surface pro. the same sort of price rnge
Insta360 gimble!
hey!!! big fan i planning to buy ipad ultra next year and for that watching all ur interseting videos on the update. Hope i win the 15 pro max which can help me alot in my studies.
id like the ipad mini with m1 and a few upgrades
of course but not in the likely higher price
I definitely need an iPad Pro or i would say iPad ultra to be precise with a larger screen for sure  hope apple gives us that in 2024
I just bought a pair of Sony xm5's on Black Friday so atm I'm not planning on buying anything in the near future. I might wait for the iPhone 16 Pro to come out so I can get that tho. Either that or I might be interested in a new MacBook
Matt I would like an ipad Ultra when it arrives… and of course I’d luv2win the 15ProMax🙏🏼⚓️🦘
I have no intention to get a new iPad unless it has a larger screen. I have patiently  waited for years now. As an artist I need a larger screen.
Apple all the way here! I got a new iPad Air this year, but a new watch or phone would be next on my wish list. My iPhone is 11 Pro Max, lol, and even farther back my watch is VS 3! But they both work perfectly even after all this time.
The 15pro takes beautiful photos I borrowed it for two days an amazing camera and  image quality. Would like to get the 15pro thought I might get the the new iPad when it comes out but just not sure I need it but Apple is really good at convincing you to purchase things you really don’t need lol.
Samsung Is  Better Than Anything I Hope They Will Top It Make It Better Then Anything That Know One Has Seen It 🫣
I am waiting for the new IPad!!!!!!!
Show this Ipad Ultra M2 a very advanced and modern 👍👍👍👍👍
Here we go again!!
Yes, great balance of mobile entertainment and workhorse while traveling.
I really want a iPad ultra
I will get the new iPad , I’m waiting 😊
I plan to get the iPad Pro Ultra. This is perfect for me, since I’m ☝🏽of those people that actually appreciated the MacBook Pro 13 inch due to its size. I like my tech small, powerful,& convenient.
I doubt many people will buy it,and i think apple knows that too. It makes no sense to even release it.
I plan to buy a M3 Macbook Pro this year! I’d love to win that iPhone 15!
Let's say our final goodbyes to the samsung s9 ultra tablet
Apple MacBook Air
I'm gonna buy an Ipad pro and hopefully win that Iphone
Apple have a lot of new products and design changes to release in 2024. Looks like it'll be a crowded schedule to release products. It'll be interesting to see the rumors in full swing come January 2024 the closer we get to the Spring and Summer events in 2024.
Looking forward to an iPad Ultra.
Would love to get either this new ipad ultra or the new 13" ipad pro M3
Really hope I can afford the 14 ultra and also I hope to win😊
I would like to purchase iPad pro but now I think I'm gonna wait for the 2024 model and maybe some airpods
Looking to upgrade iPhone 15 pro max, hoping I win! My 12 max is getting old. Always=y want to upgrade Mac mini m1
Hey Matt have been waiting for this

Please consider me and or enter in the giveaway for the new 15 iPhone thank you so much.
Wanted to buy the new MacBook Pro by the beginning of the year - then I decided to make it happen the last few days. lol. the m3 pro chip is 🔥
I'm always interested in seeing what the new accessibility features are
Will like a iPhone
Ipad ultra sound really interesting
I have the IPad Pro but I’m definitely getting that new IPad next year
I actually would love an ipad mini with upgrades so here is hoping. Thank you for all the info and keep up the great work.
I would buy a ROG Strix Scar 18 cause I am an AI developer and gamer. My current laptop def doesn't keep up with my workflow
I am looking forward to getting this new iPad 14 inch
I’m looking to get the new IPad Ultra 14 inch model.
Looking at purchasing 2 new iPads for my wife and myself
Why 14 inch nobody is go8ng to want that. You might as well get macbook
Macos on every pro ipad.
Price = one arm and one leg.😂
Would love the iPad 14”.. but I’ll probably get either a 9gen or a 10gen.. upgrade from my 6gen.
I will upgrade my 2016 model to 2024, can’t wait anymore
This might be the one I’ve been waiting for to take over my old laptop for “remote from work” & personal activities.
I want one for school but damn I can’t wait
Hopefully
Come with hdmi
Headphones
looking to replace iPhone and maybe iPad
I hope for multiple Thunderbolt ports.  Maybe one on the side?
I am planning to buy a Apple Watch Ultra 2 soon
Matt, I’d really love to win the iPhone 15 pro max - but so would everyone else! Here’s my case… I’m a senior, 83 in December and I’m on a very limited budget. I only ever consider Apple so I am in sync with the rest of my family. My iPhone and iPad are both overdue for an upgrade but my budget doesn’t allow such luxury! My iPhone 10 has been well used but as a photographer I need to move up to an iPad Pro Max. From all I have read, it will make wonderful photographs and will almost replace my DSLR. The “want” of a new iPad pales into insignificance when compared to the “need” for a new phone. I hope you will consider me as worthy of receiving your giveaway! Thank you Matt and please keep your tech videos coming!
Stupid idea.  Better to get a MacBook 13 or 15 instead.
iPad 14” on my list
I would get a 1tb also. I’ve had my pro since 2018 still a solid device.
Ultra with an island I’m in.
Planning to buy that ipad 14th inch next year. Hopefully, they'll update the maging keyboard with some functions or shortcuts for easy use
Plan to get the new 2024 version Apple Watch even this new ultra iPad would be nice to have. But definitely the Apple Watch.
By 2024, I’m considering upgrading my 11-inch 2020 iPad Pro, potentially to one with an M3 chip. However, I find the 14.1-inch size too large for my needs, as it compromises portability.
The iPad Ultra is extremely expensive. If you were to make $180 per year, then it would literally take 15.31 years to afford just one of those tablets. Or, to put it another way, it’s basically like one iPad Ultra costs $1,239,723 USD, and you make $81k a year. Of course, no seller is going to list one iPad Ultra for $1.24 million, but that is what it feels like when you make only three figures a year. Could million dollar tablets one day be the norm? Maybe
I just want a 27” iMac!  14.1 iPad would be neat but be the same size as my 14” MacBook Pro
I'm looking to buy an Apple Pencil and an iPhone in 2024
I just upgraded to the iPad 10, but I will definitely be interested in the iPad ultra for sure
I am working off the Original I-Pad and been waiting on this Version to purchase. This Ultra would be Great to Win.
Definitely be hard to hide that beast in your back pocket.  🤣  that aside, I’d be interested for sure.  The 16 inch would be sick.  I’d love that one but 4T is insane.  I remember my first computer had 250 megs of hard drive space.  Took forever to fill it now we’re looking at 4T on a tablet.  That’s crazy.
I’d love an iPad Ultra next year! Still torn between waiting for that or buying a MacBook Pro M3 Pro though it may be a little overkill
Larger isn’t always better.
I’m saving money to buy a Apple watch ultra 2 😊
I’d like to get a refurbished 16 inch MacBook Pro.
A 14 or 16 inch iPad would seem more like a laptop or desktop than an iPad as we know it.
Dynamic island on an ipad is stupid.,, please just put all that crap in the bezel …
What is a MacBook Aeeeerrrrrr?
Couldn't care less. Weight will be similar to macbook pro using with keyboard. And still shitty software
The new gear that I hope to purchase in the next year would be the latest iPad Pro model - whether it’s the M2 iPad or the potential iPad Pro Ultra. I have the 4th generation 12.9 inch iPad Pro and I think it’s time for an upgrade. Great video!
Definitely interested in a larger iPad and AirPod max 2nd gen. Buying a series 9 watch and AirPods Pro gen 2 this year.
What a waste, buy a MacBook Air M2 and have a real computer with a real OS that can run full versions of apps.   The iPads with M1 and M2 chip Apple throttle the chips down and I image they will do the same with a M3.  As Steve Jobs named it it's a notepad for students and people that have to go to lots of meetings it's not a computer replacement.
The New IPAD 14inch for me next year!!! Just started my journey in becoming a tattoo artist so need to get drawing!!! 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
I want to buy the samsung S24 ultra or iphone 15 pro max
An M3 iPad Pro does sound interesting. Not sure about the size, though, as it will be more like a desktop monitor rather than a tablet. That said, I bet there are a lot of Tab s9 Ultra happy campers, so there seems to be a market for huge tablets.
I have been waiting for the larger iPad Pro. I have avoided doing any upgrades until I seen a larger screen.
I will love this iPad Ultra!!! And this GiveAway!!
Need it! My m1 is lagggginnggggg
There are no apps that will benefit from an M3 Pro
As a photographer, using photoshop and lightroom on the iPad is simply terrible compared to the mac apps.
3D apps do not exist on the iPad. And as long as these things conitnue to be true, it just makes no sense to have this kind of chip.
Surface Pro with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite will be the single piece of tech I'm most excited for next year!
I’ve been holding off getting the IPad Pro until one with these kind of specs comes out. I’ll be getting one for sure. Time to retire my 2013 MacBook Pro….
I want a larger iPad screen however, I want to use the screen more usefully regarding multitasking. Apple should consider Mac OS features into iPad OS and iOS for that matter. I’d like to open up multiple windows on my iPhone 15 Pro Max as well.
I've been using Samsung tablets all my life but not an ipad and it looks great after watching what features it has, hopefully I get to change to an ipad 😅
A optimese mac os would be great, samsung dex is way ahead
i plan on buyin gb the airpods pro 2 and the iphone 15 if i don't win this giveaway. good luck everyone!
I want to buy the iPad ultra
Yes, I’m definitely interested in the new Apple iPad ultra…also in the iPhone 15. I’m still on the iPhone 12 Pro Max
I just ordered the iPad 11 it was on sale for Black Friday and also Matt someone is scammers on instagram telling me that he will be gifting me a iPhone 15
I'd love to upgrade to that new iPhone 15.
Should I upgrade from my 12.9 inch iPad pro m2
Looking to purchase the largest screen size 16” with largest internal specs iPad in 2024
a 11, 12 and 13/14 inch would be perfekt. the 11 is a little bit too small the 13 to big 12 would be perfekt
This will be a big deal if (if and only if) Apple is able to uprade iPadOS to the level of MacOS.  Right now I use Surface Pro due to need to sketch, utilize desktop/laptop level file management, abililty to use external monitors as a second monitor.  Much of this is rudimentary at best with iPad Pro.  Then I would be able to utilize my computer to phone lineup as iPhone, iPad Mini, iPad Ultra and Mac Studio rather than adding a Macbook on top of all that.
Waiting to get a new iPad to hopefully get the new iPad Ultra!
14” ipad is a great way to go for ipads, apple did a really great job this year, but next year i think will be really big
Something from apple production
Um, no pricing for the 4TB model? 🤣
Just got an iPhone 15 pro max and series 9 watch. This is my first Apple Watch. So far it is neat and like discovering what I can do with it is fun. I still have a jailbroke iPad 3 that still works but unfortunately it can only use Chrome and search the net as Netflix and YouTube changed and that ipad will not work with them anymore. Battery life still blows my mind. I would love a new iPad Ultra. Good video sir.
What’s the point now that the MackBook Air 15” is out of the gates?
I didnt know there will be ipad ultra next year so im planning to have one hopefully next year as well 🤞🤞
Possibly getting the Apple Watch Ultra 2 in early 2024. I'd love a 14" iPad Pro, but my 12.9" WiFi + Cellular is amazing in itself. It's replaced my MacBook.
I want to win that iPhone. I’m interested in the ultra watch.
been wanting to upgrade my ipad pro 12.9, may just wait for the ultra then if it does come out early next year
Yes
I would love an iPad Ultra! I need a new iPhone, as I still have the 11 pro Max, and need a new iPad, as I have the 12.9 Pro M1 still.
after having the same iphone xr since release, it sure has been feeling sluggish. A new iphone 15 pro max would be great! Especially of the new 5x telephoto lens since I do enjoy taking photos with a seperate camera, will make it soo convenient for me.
Probably going to get the new iPad Pro next year.
Looking to buy the new iPad with the m3 and bigger screen!
ridiculous prices , may as well buy a MacBook Pro for those prices , can do so much more with them
This is great.
Love your videos please i need this phone
I'd love if apple made another 12 inch MacBook with Apple Silicone, I'd get it! Or M3 MacBook Air when it comes out.
Really interested in those new iPads, might buy one !
The price  for the  4tb is not listed 😮. Maybe  Apple is going to discontinue the 256 gb option. 😮
I think a 16 inch iPad would be overkill but if it comes out I will buy the 14 inch iPad. The extra screen space would help my workflow alot.
If this is true, I’ll get one for sure.
Great content, I would like to buy ipad mini 7 next year.
it's a shame that they're quite expensive, but I'll try to get mine for next year's Vodafone subscription.
larger would be better with the M3 - thanks of your thoughts and support us apple fans out here!
I’m going to buy the new iPad 14 inch, I can’t wait! 😍
No camera notch design flaw? I wish the laptop team at Apple would also take that path. Steve Jobs would never have approved of the camera notch.
Planning to get the next ipad 2024, i believe apple lost some sales when they did not released this year, some buyers probable went to try Samsung ultra, for some mid 2024 may be too long a wait. That iphone 15 looks sweet.
A 14" or 16" iPad Pro is what I've been waiting for for at least 5 years; I believe I bought my 12.9" iPad Pro in late 2015 and aside from a small battery issue (if I charge it to 100% I have to wait a day or two before it will work again) it's still working just fine.  I can imagine astrophotgraphy looking terrific on a larger screen replacement.
...and it will be £1700  for the basic one and £500 for the keyboard...and we will still have to wait another 6 years for Pro apps
I am eagerly anticipating the acquisition of the iPad Pro M3 in 2024 to elevate my graphics design endeavors. This cutting-edge device promises to be my steadfast companion, seamlessly blending power and versatility to unlock new dimensions of creativity. With its sleek design, unparalleled performance, and innovative features, the iPad Pro M3 is poised to become an indispensable tool in my artistic journey, empowering me to bring my visions to life with unparalleled precision and flair.
I would like a 16’ perfect to watch your vids 😮
Definitely interested in a larger iPad. It looks great. Definitely something I'm considering getting next year.
It took me sometime to get used the 12 so no for me
Thinking about buy my first Apple watch. Not sure what series yet. Maybe a SE.
I wish to have an iPad pro with Mac OS and a Magic keyboard  🤩 !
So that I won’t have to buy another laptop too 💻
OK I can justify a 14 inch iPad but I cannot justify a 16 inch iPad lol, I use the iPad a lot and one of the good things about iPad is supportability compared to a MacBook. It would be much harder to consider the iPad portable if it was 16 inchesas it would be very hard to hold
Is it going to release within march 24?
Well Matt you are holding my hopes for the new tech that I would love to receive in the new year. After watching a lot of reviews it’s time to upgrade to an iPhone 15 Pro Max.
If I had a choice, I'd love to get a 13inch MBA M2 in silver. My old laptop was a 2013 15inch Macbook Pro and it recently got broken. I think the new MBA is the best in terms of price, performance, and portability. By the way, love this new video on the Ipad Ultra! Keep the news coming!
This will be great for iPad programs like Procreate and the new Procreate Dreams animation program!
3:44 you say the Dynamic Island is coming in 2023, but I think you meant 2024.
I’ll order a 16” iPad the second I know it’s available. The bigger the screen the better for me.
It won't make any difference if it still as limited as it is as a wannabe laptop, the future of the ipads pro is still the hybrid macbook with touch screen, as for the Ipad air and mini, yeah, they can stay as they are, a good entertainment tablet with gaming and light use, and I can't wait to buy the new ones next year. Best
I really hope they put the m3 pro chip in the iPad Pro the extra efficiency it gets over the m3 would be great for iPad
I would like to get the XM5 or AirPods Max
Greetings! I would love to purchase the AirPods Pro 2, with usb-c!🎻
Whoa! This would save me a lot!😱 Today I just bought a photography course and I was planning to buy the iPhone 14 Pro around early next year. I can't really afford it, so if I was going to save for the 15, it would take me around 4 months.😅
After getting the iPhone, I plan on getting a MacBook Pro M2 Max. 
By the way, I love the edits of your video! 😍🔥
I would be interested in a 14 inch I Pad Pro and The M3 MacBook Air.
I think an ipad ultra would be great but ultimately I think we just need to put mac os in this thing. only reason why I say that is because we need the apps in mac os, unless ipad gets all the adobe products all in the next apple event announcement a stronger ipad isnt really going to be useful besides some very light work or just drawing.
ipad M3 chip and macbook Pro M3
iPad ultra is good
They should remove the front facing camera and reduce the price
I am looking forward to purchasing an iPad Ultra when it is released in the Spring
ipad ultra.m3
I'm a med student and want to buy a ipad for  study purpose and note making. Should I buy the iPad pro 12.9 inch or should I wait for the latest one. 
My main concern about the iPad pro 2022 model, is it going to have future updates at least for next 5 years??
planning to get an ipad pro model, it would be beneficial for college
i just iPads could run MacOS rather than iOS.  Would be much more useful to me and save having multiple devices.
I am planning to get an iPad pro 14.1 inch model with M3 chip in 2024.
looking to get a Mac but this iPad might be a better alternative as I can use it as an iPad as well
Another nice video Matt!
Im thinking of getting the iPhone 15 Pro Max 512 gb blue titanium. I think it’s good Apple finally made a 14” tablet with the selfie camera on the horizontal placement but i don’t think I’d get it because if you wanted to up the storage you have to pay hundreds of dollars. I just got the Samsung Galaxy S9 Ultra tab with the 128 gb storage but I just used my 512 gb micro sd card to expand storage and Samsung also provided a free s pen and for purchasing their tablet got a foldable Samsung keyboard with it for free since that was one of the free promos I got with it on Samsung website. Plus watching videos on different apps look better than iPads since their borders are so big and noticeable
Forget about being a spectacle about the 14-inch one because that is not happening.
I have the ipad pro 12.9. I can’t wait for the upcoming 14 inches. The bigger the better 😍😘
iPad ultra sounds interesting - might be ideal for dealing with digital image interpretation.
Those new iPads look new, perfect since I’m looking for one for a close future 👍🏽
I plan to buy a monitor for college 😁😁
a notch or dynamic island wouldn’t be necessary
Looks amazing 😍
wouldn’t an m3 pro require a fan?
The portable capabilities of the new generation of devices blows my mind! 😮
Ipad ultra 14 inch sounds very good, looking forward to it...
i really wish apple should give the better multitasking abilities with it.
I would buy a macbook air in 2024 m2
🌬️yes I would . The features l👀k awesome 🤩
Still want an Ipad Pro M1.
Yes please!😊
I am planning on iPhone 15 Pro Max in 2024 and iPad 14.1 in 2024 to replace my 12.1
All the features are great until the price comess
Fr 2nd
Great news need That iPad
Maybe
Would you be interested in a LARGER iPad?



DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! Tab S9 vs iPad Air 5


What's up everyone?! I hope this comparison of the iPad Air 6 and the Galaxy Tab S9 was helpful. Did I cover what you wanted to know? What else did you want to see or learn about?

Question in 10:41. MJ always
The never mention the file manager! Samsung so much better than the phone in my experience. Correct me if they've made any meaningful changes
That micro SD card is such a huge advantage
I was between ipad air 5 and galaxy s9 for a while now and went with galaxy s9 on sale and plus samsung tag gift. 64 gb storage on ipad air is a total deal breaker and will be obsolete in 1-2 years or with some heavy apps download. s9 is super snappy and display is just far better than ipad air5. also sound quality is outstanding when consuming films, series, or animes. deffo recommend it 👍
Android Just BS👏🏻
Wallpaper plz!!!
Always appreciate your fair and balanced reviews.  I hate Apple, but their hardware and apps are still unmatched by Android.  But Android is getting better after years behind.
Galaxy Tab s9 💪
Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is a old Samsung tablet devicd and it was so great and good
what is the name of this movie 14:59?
MJ or LEBRON?
MJ ⛹🏾
2:40 Does anyone know what that green paper-like stuff is called?
Easy choice for me the iPad. The functionality is better for me needs, with onenote respectively, and deeper integration between apps with sharesheets, the iOS workflow feature, focus modes with different set ups…
However, I picked up an Amazon Fire max 12 for £135 and for what I’m using that for it’s great value as a family shared tablet (allows more than one user).
My main phone is an android phone: quad dac, 3.5mm headphone socket, sd card slot, standalone slab or integrated dual screen options. And cost £650 new with second screen.
How does it compare to a Xiaomi Pad 6?
MJ the 🐐
You said when it comes to updates you will choose ipad considwring its 2yrs old only fiew years of updates remaining while tab s9 is  the latest from samsung
For teaching purpose and editing video? Which one is preferable?
May i know that samsung tablet able to connect bluetooth mouse to like the laptop do?
"Now, both tablets perform extremely well when paired with a controller"

*proceeds to fly his car straight off the cliff in whatever game he's playing* 13:50
iPad updates are actual updates. Android tabs two years or in some tabs just and update your tab is dead
The 11” ipad pro M1 and M2 are always on sale and can be bought for sometimes cheaper than the tab s9. Those tablets will last you a lifetime
Ipad air? This is an insult to the tab s9. The tab s9 fe would've been fair for the the air
Samsung should come up with a powerful small size tablet to compete with the iPad mini.... The mini iPad does not have a competition. People who want portable, manageable, powerful small device, default choice is iPad mini ... Which is expensive, if bought with 256 gigs of storage + LTE + apple pencil = iPad pro price territory. Not fair
Jordan.
64gb storage in 2023 going into 2024 is an embarrassment.
Still waiting for Samsung Galaxy Tab S9, S9+ & S9 Ultra battery test
you can't go wrong both of these tablets... Because Apple's 64gb storage actually looks like 256GB storage on Android... And 60Hz display looks like 120hz on Android.
where do you get wallpapers from
seeing the M1's benchmark just makes me sad because its useless
I already have an 11" iPad Pro with M1, but since we had a black friday offer this week with a free keyboard case cover and a free M8 monitor I gave the Tab S9 a shot. Both are great devices, but I prefer the S9 because of the possibility to sideload apps and the screen quality.
Samsung Tab S9 is the best tablet on the market, a multimedia monster. DEX option and we have everything just like in PC. If someone wants to have a tablet for years! S9 the best choice. The best screen, overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, great speakers, support and Samsung system. Maybe S9 is not cheap, but its capabilities outclass all Android tablets on the market. DEX is something great and you can use S9 like a PC.
Apple has to give the next generation  Air and Mini 128GB base storage. the only thing I take over the iPad with Samsung is that display. but as a suer of both (Pro 12.9 and S9 Ultra), iPad wins for me but I am heavily invested in the ecosystem.
no brainer
The iPad also does not have a home button. Samsung have a capacitive buttons.
what should I choose for genshin impact or all in all gaming? Tab S9 in my country is much more expensive than Air 5 64 GB, but I can afford Tab s8 256 gb what should I choose?
i have flipped back and forth so much between Samsung and Apple that I caved and now i have both.  It's excessive, probably, but there are things each tablet does better than the other, so i have both.  Yes, fancy me.  I love Procreate for my illustrating, and i face time with my sister, so iPad, and I Google Meet with my Mum every week, and enjoy movies in bed, so Samsung.  As always, you provide a great, unbiased view on both systems and for people who aren't sure, these are always a great way to determine which one is best for them.  Me, I'm just a weirdo, i need both lol.
Excellent as usual 
Keep up
Hey im a design student and a content creator do you believe going all the way for an ipad pro 12.9” is worth it in my case?
Hey man what are those wallpapers you use ?
Please review xiaomi pad 6
Thanks to you I got my Samsung galaxy tab 8+ and it's amazing even though I have iPhone 15 Pro Max. This tablet is the best when I travel and to watch movies.
The freedom of modded apps and game emulations is amazing on S9 series
I just sold my iPad m2 12.9 in and got me a Samsung tab s9 and I don’t regret it. It’s better to hold and the display is better visually I still have my iPhone and MacBook. Unfortunately I felt like my iPad was just a bigger phone. With the tab s9 it does feel like another device plus expandable storage is a huge plus.
Bro iPad pro M3 when it will go out.?
IMHO Tab S9 all the way ❤ thx for the video
Is it possible to compare how these tablets interact with different ecosystems? S9 with MacOS or Windows? iPad with Windows?
Hello @TechGearTalk  I had a question Sir, I use Luma fusion on my Older iPad Pro 2nd Gen and am deciding for a upgrade so, can you help me decide if Apple’s Silicon chipset us gonna give me a Maximum Outcome or Qualcom’s SD 8 Gen Chipset
I am not even byeing them and still watching the video
S9 all the way.. the 64gig storage limitation on the iPad without a card slot is a serious problem and deal breaker for sure.. come on Apple get your shit together.😎 Excellent review! I love your thoroughness and your unbiased approach. You tell it exactly like it is.
Based on your comparisons this would be a tough call if I wasn't already invested in the Apple ecosystem, that S9 is a very attractive device.
Waiting for ipad air 6 after it comes it will be a cut to cut comparison i will be interested to see that video
ya cant go wrong either way here, but 64gb of storage is an actual crime, no SD card slot is crazy...and an extra 130 for the pen is wild too im ngl
Hey could you please review xiaomi pad 6. I've using it for a month. It's wonderful. You will also get a whole new audience watching your videos.
Can you please tell me a way to get the original iPad Pro wallpapers please? I can’t find it in the wallpaper section.
if the s9 is better or not than the ipad pro is up for debate, but outside ecosystem considerations, the S9 is clearly ahead of the air in almost every aspect and even speed is not an argument, other than for the GPU
I would request yall to push to the iPad Pro 128 if possible. 64 is just not possible to use for 4 to 5 years. You will be upgrading in 2 to 3 years because the storage isn’t enough.
No android tablet will ever be better then a iPad
And plus what u said is a lie the iPad Air I have has 4 speakers 2 on one side and 2 on the other side
I’m first bro I already know that iPad Air 5 is the best and is better then all Samsung tablets (I’m watching this video on iPad Air 5 btw)



When is the iPad Pro getting M3 and other iPads UPGRADED?


What is the ipad that allow us tò write using pencil and make it as pdf.
In my near future I'm going to be needing a handy tablet that's fast, reliable and easy to use for work, taking in consideration to buy one of these products, we'll see
🌬️We ready for that 12.9 inch iPad Air! I hope the Apple Pencils & the new iPad have a new design !
Would like to see if vapor chamber cooling could work in Apple devices without fans.
Apple have been pulling our leg for a year now
iPad will be updated this year definitely but I’m looking for Magic Keyboard update and yes prices should go down as most overpriced Apple product but most essential .. saving to buy iPhone 14 Plus
I'm a musician and I want to have an iPad also because lyrics can be read easier on it rather than on phones. 😅✌️
I’m going to replace my old MacBook Pro 2013 with new MacBook Pro M3 pro. Still saving money so most likely in early 2024. It’s going to be huge moment for me. I’m so excited
Unfortunately with Apple the prices will probably be unbelievably high.
Yeah, seeing these videos, I'm excited to get an iPad pro m3. Might even go for the larger ram models
The major issue regarding ALL PERFOMANCE Improvements remains HOW much does it make in real life, can young bring the performance to the floor in real life, or in reality you are not working one percent faster than with an M1 Base processor, because in 95% of the cases the limitations is not bases on the silicon but on the Human-Machine-Interface, or on external connections, does your Brain function faster due to a faster processor, does your ISP respond faster due to a faster processor? Does the normal usecase of a person have dozends of automated workflows unattented every day, so why not placing them on a VM on a remote Server and just paying for the used cpu-time instead spending a fortune for a big machine at home. Yes the M3 Generation is noticeable faster the M1 IN THEORY, all the tests i see show ONLY Advantages in Badged Jobs that can be automated  (or e.g. only standard  corrections are applied), as you have to do specific adjustments on each file during the workflow the Human will eat up every advantage the newer generation brings. If you leave content creator and wedding phtographer stuff, coming to real life applications like Mail, Writing, Calculation, Browsing  the advantage for the Normal User reduces to Zero.
If I had a choice, I'd love to get a 13inch MBA M2 in silver. My old laptop was a 2013 15inch Macbook Pro and it recently got broken. I think the new MBA is the best in terms of price, performance, and portability. By the way, love this new video on the  all 2024 Ipads! Keep the news coming!
Amazing ! Hoping the buy the iPad Air easy year
still loving my M1 iPad Pro, but a new M3 might be something I would get .
That’s a great question, when are we going to get some update and upgrade even  hope they come soon . And am wanting to get an iPhone 13 mini or pro this year
Subbed & Liked! Enjoyed the video! Good work & God bless in ‘24!
Apple can do upgrades easily to their devices without raising prices because they have ridiculous profit margins but they will choose to raise prices an further rip off customers instead, I like an use all Apple products but Apple has been giving us less ports chargers headphones and services while charging more every few years causing the Apple tax price to get out of hand, on iPad we need 9” ipad pro with thin bezels, 👍👍video
Apple deeply knows that alot of its focus is on apple iphones ,apple watches,and macbooks the rest have minimal hype that's why only a few of their products received decent upgrades
iPads are good looking already I really wish Apple  introduce Dynamic Island and landscape camera setup across its iPads line up..
I Hope this year that iPad is on Oled display and more upgrades this coming 2024 I’m really excited with that 🤩😍
The Apple industry is making things complicated. Should a person go for an iPad or Macbook because both of the facilities are somehow the same 😅
I was thinking about getting the ipad pro 11” today lol. Is it worth it?
On tablets bezels aren’t bad, a notch or dynamic island would just get the n the way of so many tasks.
OLED upgrade would be awesome. Good point with the size and keyboard accessory. 

ENTRY FOR IPHONE 15 PRO MAX!!!! PICK ME🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 HOPING TO GET THIS IPHONE FOR 23-24🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m looking forward to an m series iPad mini
Matt I LOVES THESE VIDEOS SO MUCH THANK U FOR POISTING
I feel like the best options are the ipad mini or the ipad pro, I will buy one of those depending on the release on 2024
The tab s 9 from samsung is 899 euro  11 inch why ipad pro so expensief? the samsung have olso oled screens.
I hope to see on the iPad Pro 2024, USB C thunderbolt, M3 chip, If possible a slightly larger battery, Cooling update or even an external cooling case? , 12gMINIMUM Ram! 8g ram ill just pass the iPad Pro 24. 120-144hz Oled Screen, a small update on cameras for scanning documents, updates on external monitors so you can change orientation of screen, able to clamshell while on external. I’d really like to see tbh 2x USBC ports if possible as a extra feature, but not needed compared to 12g RAM and 256 should be min for Pro series, then 16G Ram on 500
My iPad Pro is old (that this year they have stopped updating it) so I now need to changed it, was going to do it this year, but as their was No new iPad update this year I have now put it and the iPhone update on hold until 2024. If there is no new iPad Pro in 2024, Apple my loss me as an customer, have used Apple from when they first only had a computer which was light years ahead of anyone at the time.
What about the moving of the front facing camera to work centrally in landscape mode. For me that would be the reason to upgrade.
We literally got nothing new for Christmas but a pro computer 🤦🏻‍♂️
iPad Pro 13 inches It will be awesome if it comes🤙🏻
Ipad this year is a win one, it might give us good specs and feature. Thanks for the information Sir. Matt, but I think It most like the Company looking for something new that will be the thing they do to attract the interest of the buyers
Hello Matt
I dont think the design can change as it is already good looking, but definitly needs an update, looking forward for a new event 😊
I'm looking forward for new ipad, still waiting some more before I buy M2 ipad
Will they give us the PRO chip in the iPad PRO?
I will keep my 2018 ipad pro until a 14" comes out
would be a very nice iPad
The design is fine….please dont add a fukn notch
Apple should just do an IPad event in 2024 since it seems major design changes are getting done with the 2024 releases. Apple still have plenty of other products to launch in 2024 at other special events in Summer and Fall of 2024. I am also curious if the 2nd generation Apple Pencil will get a new design since it's been around for several years now.
Buying earbug pro iPad Pro 2024
idk but i loved the ipad air that released last year, with that being said I hope they get upgraded for next year’s models
I have an iPadPr0 2018 11” with a MagicKeyboard. Can I use it with the new 2024 model?
In the end I got iPad 11 pro 2022😄
And do you think there will ever be a 4k iPad?
Will the iPad Pro have a better screen
Will the iPad Air have the M3
Any of the iPhone SE models
Thanks for the video, speaking of ipads, it may seem that apple may kill them for good with a future macbook pro in 2026-27 that will have touch screen, so they may create something like an macbook air that attaches and detaches from the keyboard like some laptops that have windows with touchscreen. In any case, I hope they put the front camera horizontal and also, more quality, since the most important camera on an ipad is the front camera, the other ones nobody uses them. Best
I love your videos
Airpodmax 2
very nice review Matt. looking forward for the iPad Pro event next year
Bring on the 12.9” iPad Air!
a15 instead of the a16 eh because the 16 isnt enough? sounds legit..
What iPad do you want to see RELEASED Next?
Do you recon the next iPad mini will be getting the M silicone?
First



Apple ipad pro 11 2022 5G vs xiaomi pad 6 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 5G


The fact that it doesnt have a global version its very sad



Apple Planning to Release Foldable iPads!


Not a fan of anything that folds. Just another thing to worry about breaking
This actually kind of makes sense more than foldable phones.
ppl believing this need to get a grip
wont a folding ipad kills the ipad mini or the keyboard accessories?
You're telling me a trillion dollar company can't come up with a new idea. I feel like apple is the kind of company to come up with a new way of chewing before finding a new actual feature for their phone.
Nice Video
at first i thought it was dumb, but having the keyboard at the bottom like a laptop is pretty cool
Sure apple can come out with OLDE screens, but its hardly that exciting for your average or high end consumer who is looking to upgrade their ipad. A folding ipad is certainly more exciting! 
My biggest fear is that they will make it too small (so doing a 10 inch ipad, which means the foldable will be like 14 inches or something when unfolded), when they should be jumping from 13 inch to 17 inch, for both portability and true big screen effect.



I Wanted the Apple Magic Keyboard, INSTEAD I GOT THIS! | BEST IPAD ACCESSORIES 2023 IPAD 10TH GEN





The Perfect Tech Gift For Your 10-Year-Old


I have an phone with service in I am only 7
I would get them 20 fucking fast charger bundes
6th gen also works well
Save money by not buying apple!
Can you do one for 11 year olds
Kids don’t need iPads 😂
I’m not using my iPad
Do you also have the iPad 8 (2020) for sale?
I’m 9 and I have iPhone 12 lol
If your child is 10 years old, DONT BUY THEM A FUCKING DEVICE YOU HORRIBLE PARENT
I saw 5 y/o kids with iPhone 13 Pro Max it do be different
Bro I am 14 and I have been asking my m for a tablet since I was 9
I am 10 in the 5
I’m 11 and I’m in middle school
I am 10 with a iPad 10th and a iPhone 13 I am anything but thankful and grateful
Haha I’m ten I don’t think you know what’s going on but parents don’t take the advice 8 and under need an I pad 10th gen or above and in middle school a phone kids now have a phone at 6 even
I HAVE A QUESTION!

Are the phones unlocked? Or since they are from carriers are they locked to the carriers y’all get them from?
You could just buy an ipad 9 brand new for just $229 😅
how are 10 year olds in 4th grade..
Just get them a fvking book
I thought you said “this is the best advice, you can get a ten year old for your birthday!” I had to rewatch the clip so many times
İm 4 th grade i have a phone it is iphone 15
I am 10 years old in fifth grade and I have an iPad Air 2 😊
I am ten and have that iPad
But the pencil said piece of junk because of the way it charges some sort to say
Why even give them any electronics??? I didn't got my 1st phone until lock down.
What do you recommend for a 13 year old
i got a hudle. What is a hudle you might ask? it's a tesco own brand tablet for about £50-100 when i was 7 when we went to france. I coped on that until i was 11 when i got the old 2016 iphone SE when i started high school, i wouldn't give a kid an ipad, rather a samsung tablet or a knock off....apple are just expensive
Nice but 10years old is 5th grade for your advice
a iPhone SE will be better the iPad seventh Gen is too old for them.
Nah bro iPhones on top
Aint no way giving a 10y/o their own device is good for them... they can use their parents with permissions but not more than that
All kids need a phone nowadays
10 year old getting no nothing
Get an iPad 10 or a mini. The 7 is almost obsolete
I got a ipad pro when I am only 10
I am 11😅 I have 6th
"To play games and watch videos on..."

Said no parent ever.
i hate this channel
Could you please do my order #2222278
Wow.Apple would say this is a scam beacuse of the discount😂😂😂
I know right gotta glue them to the tech early, ugh
Is iPad 10th gen a good deal for a 14 years old
when i was 10 i was at 5th grade
These kids don’t need technology or learning from YouTube. What happened to the simple learning toys and games. Make them go outside and play
I would give my kid a phone until their 15
Or just let them have an attention span
I know they want to sell ipads but its proably the worst thing you can get for your kids. Hell, Steve Jobs would t even let his kids have an ipad.
i had the 2017 macbook 12in retina bru. it suckeddd
What about for a 16 yr old
Not reccomeded unless u poor stop telling us what u recoomend i have a 5th pro and im 10
What is the website’s name?
Some more e waste
Im ten years old and i have the exact same ipad😂
Why don’t you gift him an iPod?
First of all im 10 and in 6th grade and why are you saying an apple pencil will inprove spelling like its a 5 y.o
NO A KID DOESNT NEED ANYTHING THIS GENERATIONS SUCKS PLESSE DONT GOVE YOUR KIDS IPADS AND IPHONES GET THEM A NOKIA OR SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN CALL AND MESSAGE THEY DONT NEED TIKTOK ETC
Every time I watch Plugtech videos I thank God that he created me smart enough not buy and overpay for stuff from them…
You've made my day with this video
What about the five hundred million fast charger bundles for just 5 billion dollars??
what can i get for 2000$
How much does the Pencil cost???😊
I am 10 and I have the iPad 10th gen so therefore a seven year old would need a seventh gen
WHAT ABOUT 20 FAST CHARGERS FOR $200???
Yea this did not help…
Nah if was a parent I’d get him a laptop
Can u make a video about how to earn reward points on your app
iPad 7 about to be obsolete







Edit: it’s a lot of money for an iPad that’s about to be obsolete, your money is better spent elsewhere.
Why are you advocating for more children to have iPads. They’ve already ruined enough children.
Do you guys ship to thev cribben
What iPhone do you recommend for a 10year old?
I am also 8 with MacBook phone and ipad
I am 8 and in 4th grade
I think it’s different as I’m in England and 10 and in year 6
Can you make a videos of how y’all make the MacBooks look good and check to see if they are good
What about 11 y. o?
Im 14 years old, And I use my father phone..
Because I got no phone 😢
Don't forget about the 10$ fast charger bundle
Can you ship to Yakutsk? I really need a new phone! Mine is a 6s plus!
How about a 13 year old
That’s cheap
I’m early
How about an 9.99 fast charger bundle ???
Hi

Apple Products We’re Expecting in 2024


Yes, I’m looking forward to Apple stuffing Siri with AI smart. It’s about time.
If there will be another SE, it should be the 5.4" size of the 12/13 mini or at least the 5.8" size of the X-11 Pro. Some people actually need normal sized phones, not phablets.
I want a next gen beats fit pro with ANC
Apple became boring.😝
iPhone SE 4 in iphone mini form factor!!
I'm happy the iPad Pro is finally getting an OLED Screen, it's long overdue, and I think the rumors have OLED coming to the MBPs in 2025 too. Also would like to see the Apple Watch Ultra get a black colorway and possible even Micro-LED, but very unlikely according to the latest rumors.
I know for sure I’m not getting what I want from Apple:  a new iPhone mini.
I'm 😊
All I want is split screen multitasking
Can’t Wait for the 60Hz iPhone 16 🤣🤣
Get your own tech channel!! You’re too good!!!
Save your money.
I want to be able to switch between the front and back cameras during a video recording
I hope to see apple AirPod Pro Max with new chips & USB C charging & perhaps larger iPad pro’s… we can only wish…
More products coming that no one can afford. 😂
I genuine thought this was from the 1990’s
I was wondering what that flat, square, silver thing with the Apple logo on it was. I’ve found one around house the and have been using it as a coaster.
Amazin products, but the price 😍
Every companies, including Apple, should learn from Taylor Swift on how to get cult-like following from zombie fans.
We're not even in 2024 yet and these guys are coming with bs claims. Just let the actual thing come and cover it guys.
zamzam water
Omg this was literally the best video and you are the best!! 
You are the happy pill of the day. Thanks again for this video. Waiting for your new video..
I want a new SE
The screen upgrade to microLED on the watch ten is an interesting news I bet it going to be a magical piece. And when this microLED reach on other devices screen viewing probably wouldn't be the same. The 11"-13" iPad size is ideal sizes for tablets I like it. 😎💯👊🏾👍🏾 All the Apple news are great news
I think Apple needs to do more to the iPad to boost sales than M3 and a new display. The OS needs to be re-imagined to make the case for the product category.
🍏
THE MACBOOK COULD HAVE A 
(REMOVABLE MAGSAFE DISPLAY BACKING) THAT COULD LAY FLAT ON A DESK OR FLAT SURFACE AND CHARGE APPLE PRODUCTS LIKE YOUR WATCH OR AIRPODS OR YOUR IPHONE. OR ALL OF THEM.
MAYBE THE ADDED
MAGSAFE SURFACE COULD
FOLD-OUT FROM BENEATH THE KEYBOARD AND STILL BE DETACHABLE FROM THE KEYBOARD. IT COULD BE MAGNETIC AND FOLD-OUT FROM THE BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT OR TOP OF THE KEYBOARD AND STILL DETACH.


APPLE COULD MAKE AN IMAC WITH A MAGSAFE TRACKPAD STAND BASE TOP.

THE APPLE TV,MAC MINI,AND MAC STUDIOS COULD ALL HAVE MAGSAFE TRACKPAD TOPS.

APPLE COULD MAKE A
(MACBOOK MINI).

THE NEW IPAD MINI COULD HAVE A (MAGSAFE SIDING) YOU COULD ATTACH NINTENDO SWITCH JOYCONS TO.

AN APPLE WATCH ULTRA 3 COULD HAVE A (BUILT-IN PROJECTOR) LIKE THE SAMSUNG GALAXY BEAM HAS.

THE NEW AIRPODS COULD BE (CELLULAR) AND THE CASE COULD FEATURE A DISPLAY.

THE AIRPODS MAX COULD
(HEAT YOU UP) WITH A
(BUILT-IN AIR-CONDITIONER) AND COULD HAVE A NECK MASSAGER AND AN AIR-FILTERING SYSTEM TO GET RID OF THINGS LIKE COVID...
THE AIRPODS MAX COULD ALSO BE (CELLULAR).

APPLE COULD MAKE A (VR-ONLY)
APPLE VISION PRO FOR (CHEAPER) THAT COULD PLAY
SONY PLAYSTATION VR GAMES.

THE SE4 SHOULD HAVE USB-C AND A GOOD BATTERY IF APPLE WANTS THE GROWTH THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE IPHONE DEPARTMENT.

AN ((APPLE PENCIL)) THAT (SHORTENS) TO THE LENGTH
OF AN IPHONE CASE IT COULD DOCK INTO AND CHARGE IN USING A MAGSAFE CHARGING SYSTEM BUILT INTO THE CASE WOULD BE NICE. IT COULD
ALSO CHARGE ON THE SIDE OF THE IPHONE FURTHEST AWAY FROM THE CAMERA CLUSTER WITH MAGSAFE TECHNOLOGY BUILT INTO THE SIDING OF THE IPHONE LIKE THE IPAD PRO HAS.

AN MP3 PLAYER/PERSONAL ASSISTANT APPLE RING OR
SMARTRING OR (RINGPOD) WOULD BE INTERESTING.


THAT'S JUST THESE PRODUCTS'
FIRST STEP INTO A LONG EVOLUTION OF NEW INNOVATIONS THAT WILL BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE....
               .... I'D LOVE TO SEE AN
                          APPLE CAR......AN
                    APPLE TRUCK...

               ....APPLE HUMAN 
              ARTIFICIAL ORGANS..

     ...APPLE REVERSE-AGING TECH...
None of these are new products.  VR goggles are the closest thing, and they are not new.
I’m hungry for more but my wallet isn’t hungry for more Apple products. 😂 No updates next year on nothing, maybe just if the new iPhone it’s something revolutionary otherwise i will keep my 13 Pro.
I just hope they put the M3 in the Vision Pro. At this price it really deserves the best processor.
Bridget is my favorite CNET reviewer ❤
Just waiting on the next big iPad pro as a pro artist
thank you
More Apple products?… yawning. More Bridget videos?… yummy!
Apples iphone price is to high, £600 for six years support is about right.
Has anyone noticed cnet doesn't like, heart or comment in any of their videos? Cnet can't hide their love for apple if they tried.
What a display on the airpod case like jbl
I just sense apple wont get good sales this Black Friday
I'm more interested in software updates (WWDC) than product launches.
I love all the Apple coverage on this channel! ❤ Thank you! 🙏
Apple moving ever closer into the medical device market & away from communication & Internet devices, spawning  21st century heath anxiety mental health issues for millions of people.
A blood sugar monitor, great for the 10% of the world's population who suffer from diabetes, absolutely useless for the other 90% of us who don't.
Give me an iMac with 27 inch screen, user upgradable RAM, and user upgradable storage.

Onboard soldered storage is a no-go.
I want a bigger iPhone at least 7 inches
What a great way to end the week by watching another Bridget video. 
Very cool insights & topics to discuss
And all will be insanely expensive and overrated
So we are looking for overpriced Chinese gadgets that don't let us do what we want?  Thanks for the info CNET
I love how she changes her eye movements; it's unbelievable, and I love it.
Thanks for the Apple maybe update...
Great stuff (as always), Bridget! 👍🏼
I so badly want a real Apple Watch refresh. Either a round version that looks like a watch or a fitness band style. I refuse to buy the Apple Watch while it still looks like a dorky square screen taped to your wrist.
iPhone fold, im tired of waiting. I just don't get it why they are waiting to release it
I’m not buying Mac till it becomes a 2in1
Apple is the best.
Don't make videos when there is nothing new to talk about. When you have nothing to talk about, you bore us with Apple products. Stop being obsessed with Apple so much.
The iPhone SE should go away for good
And I would like apple to also make their AirPods pros and their regular AirPods I just want the case to be different colors than white The earbuds can still stay white, but if they do have to keep everything white, make it a Matt white. Not glossy. And I would also like Apple to allow their AirPods to work with any device where all the features can work with android phones with an app.
And I also want apple to make their iPhones be a little bit thicker don’t ever make them thinner bigger battery life, fully metal on the back only glass on the part where there’s wireless charging and take the top part of the phone and make the bezel a little bit bigger and take all the sensors that are for the Face ID and cameras and speakers and put them in that bezel area so you don’t have any cut out on the screen ever and then put a heat sink sink in the inside of the iPhone so the iPhone doesn’t overheat
Can the Apple Watch please not be thinner bigger, battery, life and flat displays on all the models and I want the Apple Watch to have the ability to be able to get set up without ever having to be hooked up to an iPhone and to be able to update software update with no phone I would like the Apple Watch to be able to be used with people that have android phones
Can we get new designs for iPads please the iPad pros the iPad Air the iPad mini the regular iPad I want all the iPads to have the camera on the top of the iPad like the regular cheaper iPad and I also want the regular cheaper iPad to be able to support the pencil to be able to charge and magnet to the iPad and they can do it if they really wanted to do it if they wanted to because I saw another company do that in Apple is not doing it and can the iPads please get bigger battery life and the ability to use the steam website to play steam games, I would love apple to get rid of the iPad Air for good
I just want one thing. I want Airpods Max to have ventilation in the ear cups so that all the humidity from the heat of your ears get sweat droplets on the speakers and destroy the Airpods Max in less then 2 years. Fix that one flaw that of course Apple has no idea about and will NEVER admit such a thing. But yeah, do that for me Apple and we good. Till then i have a $500 paper weight and pist. ✌️
How about an Apple watch X with a camera.
An iPad with an M3 is so overpowered. I wonder what software they would build for that thing?
Really Cnet? You missed the biggest product - Vision Pro.
airpods Max needs MORE then just usb-c and more colors •_•
A home pod mini with some sort of display would be nice. I also would like to see a round Apple Watch.
There's way too much Apple coverage on this channel
The Nintendo Switch 2 is the only thing I am looking forward to in 2024. 😎
WAITING
120 hz on regular iPhone
Hi
Waiting for an OLED Mini
The real things that we are expecting from Apple includes ability to rearrange icons the way we want on the home screen, pause a video recording and fast charging.



A Big Order: Package It Up With Me


What’s the point of getting an iPad Air 2 in 2023? It’s literally slow af
I got one apple MacBook Air 150 not got a scratch on it or nothing I mean perfect but I didn’t get it from them. I got it myself from another company.
Bad condition - eco-friendly condition, that’s some next level bs lmaooo
I have a macbook air 2015. Just so you know, it is slow as a dinosaur. It also has a significantly reduced battery life.
Do you deliver to slovenia
You can walk out of the Apple Store with 16 airtags for $400
“You can’t walk out the Apple Store with that cost” 

Yeah maybe because the Apple Store’s MacBooks and iPads aren’t used from 2017 and will go obsolete within the next year or two.
If this is a real. The person who bought these is screwed up.
I did?
Matthew unboxing mystery box  get 5 fast charger for fry up his phone
I swear plug has the most random price range. Some of there prices are great and some of their prices suck
Do you ship to Australia?
Matthew just spent $400  for some 10 years old outdated pieces of cardboard
Ya, Can I get a Macbook? My Laptop is from 2011. XD
110$ for an iPad air 2!?!? That's the worst "deal" Ive ever heard of
That is way overpriced for that iPad from ages ago I'd pay max 60 bucks
im not trying to say these are good but the packaging is kinda nice
Which Samsung Galaxy do you recommend
$179 for a macbook that is 8 years old and that doeant update anymore is ridiculus. I bet i could get a laptop with an intel core i3 for that price that still updates to the latest update and is NOT REFURBISHED and cracked
Scam 1 o 1 😂
She forgot to mention the fast charger bundles
2015 macbook air.
The worst cpu in a macbook.
My brother in Christ are you going to sell the ipad 1st gen for 120 bucks next?
I have a feeling that the whole order is staged and they are taking the opportunity to show off their devices
Nearly 9 year old MacBook for £200 😂
Very very cheap... Wish I was born in USA😢😢... Ur 2nd hand market is so affordable. Here in India, Used apple products sell for nearly 50-70% of their price tag
“He bought them in good condition, no major scratches or flaws, one of them has a small dent on the back” 
Bruhh, “good condition”, but yea, pardon me, if you don’t wanna buy a Apple device that has a dent on the back, then you pay more (for a second hand item, again) 😂😂😂😂🤦🏻🤦🏻
These are legal scammers
Not bad at all I always shop with you guys thanks
So he basically got a pile of e-waste?
iPad got a really noticeable dent and it’s “good condition” ???
It’s all cheapskates buying stuff here😂😂
Mabye cause the Apple store sells only new modern devices rather than used older ones?
how much are your iphone 11 pros?
PlugBetterTech is getting their sketchy practices from DK Oldies
Most rich people stay rich by spending like the poor and investing without stopping then most poor people stay poor by spending like the rich yet not investing like the rich but impressing them...
I am surprised that no one had notice that the iPad with a dent should’ve been an “Eco friendly” category not a “Good” condition the guy ordered. Not a good move plug but respect the hustle
Do you know how slow those iPads are. Why are they selling so old tech
😂😂
At least in the Apple store you get modern hardware
$109 dollars for an iPad Air 2 is a f****** scam I paid $40 for one
109$ for a 9 year old iPad lol
Bye a better laptop instead of
ebay🍷🗿
Scammers
“Matthew” just bought 4 pieces of e-waste 😂
A 2015 laptop?' HAHAHAHA
Poor matthew
Hey why don't you show batter percentage
I bet the 50$ mystery box is 5 fast charger bundles☠️☠️☠️
Can I have an iPhone 12
Nah bro where my prize at
Why Don’t You Sell iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone SE 1st And iPhone 7 And iPhone 7 Plus?
Sc*m
You cant beat that macbook that dont update anymore im I right
It is a scam, 179 for a slow computer that in 2024.
There are way more options for 200 and under computers or desktops
aren't all of these devices out of software support already? 
He's basically spent $400 on some bricks when app support goes
What about the fast charger bundles?
she really said you cant beat a 7 year old macbook for 179 dollars💀💀
I bet he wanted a refund when he experienced the load times and battery
This the definition of a scam if I even seen one
That’s what I call a holiday special that person is one smart shopper for apple electronics 🤯🔥💯

BEST 2023 Apple Black Friday DEALS! 🍎


CRAPPLE NEEDS TO START GIVING THEIR PRODUCTS FREE CUZ THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE WORTH $0
Bro best deal to buy unlocked iPhone 15 pro…plz
What was your issue with iPad Air?  You didn’t elaborate so I wasn’t clear on what you’re saying.  That’s the one device I was going to upgrade this year.  Let me know more of your thoughts … or maybe you did a another video in it already?
Thanks for the tips. Fyi... I did find for my Ipad pro 11" the Apple Magic Keyboard from $299 to $179, 40% off. I've been wanting to splurge on this for a while. Sharing in case anyone else is interested. I ordered from Walmart's website yesterday on Thanksgiving.
Wall mart have the air pods 2n for $169
Bro how many dollars ipad pro
There is an iPad Pro deal on Sam’s clubs website.
I paid 349 on my airpods max last black friday.. not a good deal for 449 😩😂
You should buy the apple watch for me!
UK Black Friday deals are abysmal
Very simple skip the Ip15. Never go for the pro or pro. Max Battery life sucks Hopefully the 16 ultra has underdisplay face ID And the camera will be better in the battery life. A 100 times better hopefully. It can last 11 hours and a 30 Minutes or 12 hours.
Expectations leave to disappointment. But I know apple very well. Don't raise your hopes. And always apple love to disappoint their customers And I'm sticking with my iPhone 14 pro max
Happy Thanksgiving everyone, do you know where I could buy the best cheap iphones. Thankyou
we appreciate the tips and the value provided in this video
Apple Watch Ultra 2 is 699$ at Sam’s club….
Hey Sam, please discontinue any partnership/sponsorship with Casetify immediately. It has been brought to the public's attention that they've been stealing from Zack, aka "JerryRigEverything". And if they're doing it to him, you better believe they're doing it to others as well.
16 hours later the apple watch SE is no longer available on Amazon
Target had the Apple Watch series 9 41mm on sale for $329
I need to get a new iPhone 15 Pro I have $344 till my gets paid off don't know if I should've said that online
The AirPod pros use to fall out of my ear all the time, but I found switching to the small tips made them fit snugly
Shouldn’t it be Friday of colour ? You know how these offended types work…
I have an iPad Pro 128gb 2020… if anyone wants it for 600 I would love to sell it :)
Last couple years Walmart and Target had epic iPhone deals where you’d get gift cards. When the 14 came out, I got the 13 pro at Walmart for $100 off.. and then a $450 Walmart gift card.  No lie.
You're leaving StL? where to?
Why the iPhone 4 on the charger in the advert? :)
😮
Pay with your soul and receive a $5 gift card to subway - Apple Black Friday Deal
Looking for Apple TV 4k deals
I bought the Beats Studio Pro for 169 bucks instead of 350 bucks from Best Buy they are on sale for Black Friday l think it is worth it for the price.
I saw they had AirPods Pro for 169 at Walmart but they’re lightning should I get those or usb c?
!d!ot
Every time you badmouth the ipad mini i can see John Prosser fuming
I was planning on getting the 15 Pro because I thought I would get the promotional 75 dollar gift card. I WAS WRONG. I'm not going to buy it anymore
I seen AirPods Pro 2 usb-c for 169 on Walmart
the airpods pro usbc were 189 before black friday
No deals on MacBook Pro 14 M2 !?
Got the airpods pro. Over beats fit and bose ultra qc buds this was the good choice for me
what case do you use for your iPhone at@2:48
I bought the Beats Studio pros and apple AirTags at Best Buy and when I ordered they gave me Apple Music etc for free
iPad mini is probably the most useful iPad and I don’t know anyone that doesn’t love theirs.   Not perfect but really good
Too expensive even if I do have the money. Thanks but no thanks.
How does the ugreen brand differ from Anker? Design philosophy and how they present themselves is strikingly similar?
I managed to get a 15 pro max for $300.00 from T-mobile and I could’ve been more happier since they also transferred everything from my 11 pro max to my 15pm that had playlists of songs I liked on YouTube that I’ve worked on for the past 3 years that I thought I would lose forever they even gave my mother a 15 plus for free with same purchase of my 15pm like how insane is that I think T-mobile might my new favorite phone place instead of Apple all in exchange for joining their network.  Was it worth though?  I’ll say it is
Walmart had a black Friday for airpods 2 pro for $169
Good info
beats pro are 99 at walmart
3:42 buy it for me! lol 😂

iOS 17.2 - Inevitable!


Have an 11, I know it’s old, but new update somehow isn’t allowing me access to iCloud, find my, family sharing. Sure there is more but this is what I’ve noticed so far.
I just brought the iPhone 15 pro max and I don’t like the battery it seems to drain really quickly
I have multiple problems with iOS 17.1.1 the problems are.
1 I ask Siri call people in my contacts and it says people I don’t have in my contacts and I say call Gran it comes up with calling technical apple support. 
2 posters are disappearing and more.
Apple says only a update can solve the issue and they told the developers
Anyone has got batteries drained in iPhone 13 Pro
sorry after updating from 16.7
I’m using 17.2 beta 3 and just realised that I can use PIP in YouTube again without being a premium subscriber. Is this a thing now or is it just a bug that YouTube will fix soon?
whatsapp mic glitches when you try and hold down to send message, youtube music glitch while opening facebook, battery drain at faster rate, slower charging speeds, apple face id glitching, not as fast as before 2 seconds vs 0.5 seconds  like 1 month ago lol.
Aaron your favourite notification bug is still there and probably going to stay till ios18 😊
Before iOS 17 my battery health was 92 percent. I got the 14 pro max at launch. My battery health after iOS 17 has dropped to 89 percent….
Hey why am I able to get your video in picture on picture ? 🤔 I do not have YouTube premium.
Do you think apple fix low power mode ?
Battery drain in 15pro max is just disgusting in this 17.1.1😢
Why does iPhone imessage keep reverting from a contact name to the contact number? Is it a bug?
I am not receiving authorization codes in text messages
I just hope the excessive storage issue gets fixed.
I am inevitable -Thanos.
I actually use the action button to get to all my quick shortcuts. But I mainly use it for the camera.
Has anyone had a problem with the last update splitting up your music albums
I hope the 17.1.2 comes out today, my phone has rebooted four times today alone.
My 15 pro max does not charge in my Honda 🤦‍♂️ it sucks. Works every where else except the car
What’s interesting is that Titanium isn’t as heat conductive as Steel; I wonder if that is causing the heat to localise more than the steel casing which would presumably allow the heat to dissipate across the casing more widely?
lagging IOS in 2023 , feels like Android 10 years ago, new emojis are important every update anyways, that's major!
Best channel regarding Apple news. Thanks Aaron, have a great day!
What watch face is that??
Severe overheating 15Pro, 17.1.1, wireless charging on 2023 Tesla Model S Plaid. AirPods Pro2 constant disconnects and jumps to iPad back and forth to iPhone.
Weird U start to publish videos almost everyday…$$$
Hi @aron , Been following for quite some time now. Keep up yhe good work. 

I have a question, i got my 15 Pro Max exactly a month ago and within normal use the battery decreased to 99% at 25 cycles. Is that normal? 

With previous iPhones, i started seeing % drops after 3-4 months.

Thanks 🙏
I really love your videos. But please I would be grateful if you please help me buy the 15 pro max (brand new) with 512gb of storage
You can purchase any color, but I would prefer the blue titanium, just like yours
Hi Aaron. Thanks for the update. I love ur videos. Please I need a favor from you.

Please can you help me get a brand new iPhone 15 pro max with 512gb of storage. Please if you grant my request, I will be so grateful. Thanks
My 14 pro max on 17.1.1 keeps fading to black momentarily when watching video. It appears to do it at the same place each time. Not certain why it’s doing that. I’ve tried disabling tru tone and auto brightness but nothing seems to affect it.
My friends all getting their contacts wiped…ios 17 🤬👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I had the Apple Watch since it came out and the app all go I have no app from third party apps apart from “tiny game of pong”  that’s awesome but twitter and there was a good TV guide app that shutdown because they can make money and when the watch came out there was apps for everything and the slowly disappeared and it’s still the same you get a notification on your watch and that’s it can’t tap and get taken to the app it’s still disappointing for a ten year old device and they still are changing the buttons function Apple don’t know how to use the watch still it’s sad for the newer $1000 plus ultra watch ⌚️
19:38 voiceover doesn’t work on the action button no menu no voiceover program is just another switch for mute
Since iOS 17 iPhone 14 plus, I seem to be having issues sending texts to android users, where my phone shows I sent it but the person on the other end never receives it. One test they got the picture message but not the text. Send as SMS is on, but I feel its not working right. Turning iMessgaes off seems to help but. It kinda seems like it might be happening more when im at home on wifi, vs being out and about on cellular. I had an iPad with the texting forwarding on, but recently turned that off. I factory reset both my devices lastnight, iphone 14 plus and Apple Watch S8, everything is pretty much default and send as SMS is on, having the watch send a text to an android contact fails with try as SMS, so I think there is something wrong with that option. Have you heard of issues like this with iOS17? I might try the beta option today and see if that helps??? You mentioned Focus in your bugs section, I noticed my watch wont come out of sleep focus on its own and takes a few toggles to get it off. These poor updates lately are really causing me to rethink my next phone.
There are massive number of people in apple community discussion complaining about the 15 pro the photos turning dark after taken.
I’ve noticed my phone getting extremely hot while using iOS 17.1.1 when playing simple games such as Roblox hopefully this issue is addressed and fixed
I read the title in Thanos's voice
I realized that 17.1.1 has terrible battery life in my opinion.
Spatial video is only for iPhone 15 pro, not 14 pro 7:32
The video is good as usual and thank you for always linking the wallpaper in description, love you guys for it...and of course for the content :)
Time to change wallpaper ❤
Am on 17.1.1 on iPhone15 PM. Tried to launch the camera from the lock screen quick access button. The cam opened but nothing else was visible. Swiping left did open that camera and I also managed from the home screen. Anyone else observed this bug. Tried yo replicate but did not succeed
I have 15 Pro max ios 17.1.1 with great battery life,  laggy while scrollling, typing,.... Its not a 120hz feeling
Not a beta tester so I am uncertain how to report a bug.  I am on 17.1.1 on my 15 Pro Max.  I had the keyboard disappear while using the search. The keyboard was not visible, but if you tapped the screen where it was supposed to be it typed letters.  I restarted my phone and it cleared up the issue
Never update to a new version of iOS and iPad OS for at least two months. The previous version is still supported by Apple for a few months at least.
nice video 👍🏻
What about the storage bug?
Still have all the same issues on 15 pro max 17.1.1 screen burn in still a factor as well.
Rcs will not be crypted as mkhd said, not like iMessage
Recently bought Iphone 15 pro and kept upto 80% limit but i had charged two times more than 80 .Is it a problem or anything defect??Can any reply and help me
Soooo I just noticed that the 80% charge limit doesn't always work.
I usually charge my phone overnight with the limit in place. Sometimes it  still charges all the way to 100 on ios 17.1.1 on the 15PM.
I upgraded to 17.2 public beta 3 because 17.1.1 was really buggy on my 15 Pro Max. The phone got super hot. WiFi barely worked and dropped frequently.
No fix yet for the wallpaper?!!!!! 😬😬😬
This updates are so “BLAH”…..they need to give us more USEFUL software features……. I’m becoming more and more bored with my iphone and it’s stagnating progress 💯💯
ios 17.1 eats up so much of my iPhone 11’s battery health. It goes down 1% every week since I update.
I set my shortcut button set on magnified glass. With my bad vision, this is most helpful to read labels.
So far I have been super disappointed on 17.x,,, so much other then my mess around device my primary driver has stayed on 16.x with no current plans to move off. Your videos have been super helpful and are the deciding factor for me to stay on 16 and keeping my team at work from spinning our wheels when users have issues with their devices.
I dream with the day apple fixes the effing keyboard. It's ridiculous.. they never fix it
I have serious issues on 17.1.1 with AirPods Pro not connecting properly until I restart the phone over and over again. Seems like I’m not the only one
With almost 3 years in Android, I am now back with my brothers and sisters on iOS, and it has never looked so good.

I welcome my old self back, 

(( iPhone 15 Pro max owner with a lot of pride ))
Can someone justify why the watch shows what playing on the phone a few ways. If it doesn’t play sound what is the point?
I haven't received notifications from mail app for a very long time.
I don’t get why the journal app needs to be part of an OS update. 98% of people aren’t gonna be using it anyways
And I too have had problems with NOT RECEIVING my notifications as well! I am not on Beta, but the problem still occurs even with the battery drainage issues. Drops too quickly!
Iphone 14 pro should be pretty good on ios 17.1.1
When does 17.2 drop?
17.2 has a bug of dropping phone calls and the phone app freezing all of a sudden ….works only when you reboot the phone
This is the only video where Picture in Picture works without any premium membership on iPhone. 

Does anyone know why ?
My iPhone 15 Pro Max has had poor battery since day 1. I have to charge it at least twice a day. I even turned off the always on display. I was better off staying with my iPhone X.
All of a sudden I noticed yesterday two issues got fixe on my phone, without doing an update. 1) Last weekend I showed my friend on my phone and his how anyone can open the camera and then click to see the album. At some point yesterday (Friday) the issue stopped. 2) CarPlay on my Ram truck quite often would not connect to my phone until I unplugged and replugged in my phone several times. That issue seems to have gone away as well.
Thanks for the video, Aaron
Anyone using iPhone 14 Pro Max on iOS 17.2? How’s the battery life and browsing speed? Thanks!
I hope the Apple Watch with AirPods bug gets fixed with the volume. If you have your AirPods in and then use the Digital Crown for the first time the volume shoots to maximum volume automatically.
Anyone else having crackling issues with the iPhone 15 earspeaker?
My Wi-Fi just drops randomly or doesn’t connect when I return home ….can be using mobile data for ages before realising
I’m on 17.1.1 since release day and it works like a charm, mostly battery wise wich was I was waiting for , no bugs and it last all day , I won’t update till the next is also good with battery life
17.2 beta 3 has been great for me. Better battery life than 17.1.1. Iphone 15 pro max
Mr Zollow tech.  I am an a loyal apple user ( laptops iPads and phones) but recently apple proved they has zero support for loyalty or their products

. I have full proof. Thoughts.
I have an iPhone 12 and I use At&t service and I am on 17.1.1and the cellular modem is very slow connection.
This new iOS 17.1.1 is literally drinking my iPhone 11 battery 😭
When im in a FaceTime call over my airpods pro and watching something on youtube or netflix, everytime i get out of the youtube or netflix app and come back again, the volume decreases. Are you having this problem?
Thank you so very much for your content I really appreciate it I don’t use the book that came with the iPhone I just use the kindle unlimited through someone else ❤😊
Does anyone have youtube Picture in Picture i saw it for the 2nd time now
How about the iPhone 11 update
My 15 pro doesn’t give any major battery life and still getting decently hot also it heavily drains the battery while using the camera and gets hot to anyone agree please respomddd
iOS 17.2 beta 3, yesterday I was watching YouTube on cellular data, the connection dropped and a notification popped out of the Dynamic Island stating “could not activate cellular data network
Turn on cellular data or use wifi to access data”. My cellular plan in settings disappeared, then It took about 30 seconds before it returned. No issues since. Spoke with T-Mobile, no issues on their end
I would say the battery on my IPhone 13 Pro Max has gotten better with the update. 😊😊😊
Aaron… I'm wondering if some of these bugs could be iPhone specific. I'm running the current version on an iPhone 11 Pro and have virtually no bugs at all. No notification bug or dropped calls or anything. All of this makes me nervous to update my phone since my 11 Pro is a gem!
A small additional thing I'd really like to see added is in the Find-My app; show the time, or date/time, of people where they are. I follow a couple of people who travel internationally a lot, I check to see where they are but often have no idea of what time it is where they are. On top of that the switch to and from daylight saving is not the same date worldwide so showing time would mean less chance of FaceTiming them while they're asleep.
Useful video Aaron! It would be nice if Apple would fix the lone bug I'm experiencing, but I don't have my hopes up (the clock timer sound only using the default). I'm guessing (to Apple), this is a very minor bug and is very low at what bugs to fix. Unfortunately, especially for those who use more than one timer at a time.
I noticed with this 17.1.1 battery life is not as good as before
I use the action button for orientation lock.
Wait what. Why I can PiP this video :D :D the other video is not the same :D
I truly wish there were no betta releases. They’re a waste of time and are upsetting as well. I never pay attention to them.
iOS 17 features are crowded out by the problems and issues folk are having. iOS 17 has been trash and the most buggy I’ve ever had on an iPhone. 

And 15 pro max isn’t supported yet on things like Sonos Trueplay tuning
Aaron 
iOS 17.1.1 has a bug for screen in iPhone 13
On 17.2 beta 3 has anyone else noticed that if you change Siri's voice that it will revert back. For example I live in the UK but prefer the American voice for Siri. The voice keeps automatically reverting back to the British voice.. nothing major just sightly annoying.
Typing lag is definitely a thing 11:06
When you mention issues; are these only related to the pro models or to all iPhone 15 models?
I don’t understand why in some apps the notification sound has changed and some are normal . Does anyone else is experiencing this?
Hi Aaron, I recently brought 15ProMax, but i’m not satisfied with its battery life at this ridiculously priced 1920USD in India
I am on 17.1.1 and since the last couple of updates, my AirPods Pro 2 have difficulty connecting to my phone and sometimes it’ll disconnect in the middle of conversations. My son has the beats and he has the same problem. We both have 14 pro max. It’s so frustrating
Ios 17 is garbage. Staying on 16.7
I am on iOS 17.1.1 on my refurbished iPhone 12 Pro and I have noticed a lot of lag just when opening control center or swiping throughout iOS. I feel as though before iOS 17 my phone ran a lot smoother. Also, I use a 20W wired fast charger and it is hit or miss if my phone heats up, before 17.1 it heated up to a worrying degree and I would unplug it before charging more.
People are really excited about a "Journal App"??  Most of us aren't 16 year old girls.  Seriously, give us a good battery and improve Siri.  But hey, at least I get some really cool "stickers".
Speaking of the camera did anybody notice when you different modes( regular, dark and etc.) the click sound changes. Don’t know if it’s a bug but it’s cool
I hope this smooths out the jerky scrolling on my 15 pro max
Have they figured out how to implement swipe-to-dismiss the options like the WiFi and Bluetooth settings yet?
Try this: Wipe-down from top-right corner -> Hold the WiFi icon -> Now swipe to dismiss it.  Is it working?
Yay…bayter
I regretted upgrading to ios 17 for my iphone 11 pro. Almost unusable due to battery drain and very hot phone.
I really want the notification sound be fixed. This is a major turn off for me being a basic and fundamental functionality that is completely broken.
iPhone 13 Pro Max user here. iOS 17 is the first iOS update in YEARS that has caused my phone to overheat. Like damn my phone is always hot when im using it even when im just scrolling on instagram
not to be rude but you have one of the worst video titles and thumbnails ever.. "ios 17.2 - inveitable/persistance/inception/imminent" like what?
I’ve had a problem ever since iOS came out.  This happens every so often.  When I receive a call it goes straight to voice mail.  If I power off the phone this fixes it.  Also when this happens when I try to make a call I get call failed
iPhone 15pro with 17.1.1 often doesn’t ring when someone calls, my watch will ring once and they both will show a call is coming but no sound.
I do use the journal app every day
Hi Aaron, 😊
I prefer to wait until the public releases, I’d be a bit worried about using the journal as well in beta form. I prefer a digital clock. Thanks for all this it looks good! ❤😊xx
Nice video
Just patiently waiting for new watchOS update as my series 5 still has broken battery life
Yes the battery is not good
I have been a user of Day One for a few years and, in my opinion, I think Journal is just a Sherlocked version of Day One. I think Day One is the superior app because that's their only product. They do one thing and do it exceptionally. I think it's just as disappointing as when Apple came out with Sherlock in OS 9.
in the process of returning my 15 Pro because the battery is hands down the most horrendous battery I have used in a phone period. It's such a nice phone but it doesn't even make sense with that battery and I am not even a power user.
I have the iPhone 14 Pro and I’m actually fine no problems full day full usage
My birthday on December 4
Im on 41 cycles so far.
My 15 on 17.1.1 battery capacity dropped to 99% with just 48 cycles. Is there anyone facing this issue😢
Let apple include split screen, it’s an awesome feature we need
Still such a bad firmware update with so many bugs…my confidence in apple is fading fast, I’m sure others feel the same
I don´t know why the Journal app is necessary. I find it unnecessary so I don´t use it, I uninstalled the app.
Why journal is not available for ipad os beta?
Nice video as always 🎉 keep it up
Great vid Aaron!, iOS 17.2 works great on me so far 😊
How you got that weather weget too show full week forcast?
what type of power supply/charger do you use? 20 watts at night? with cable o magsafe?   thanks and by from italy
When Do you think there will be a 17.1.2 Aaron?
I still DO NOT have that notification swipe up bug.... Have not had it since 17 betas last summer lol
im on 17.1.1 on a iphone 15 pro max and my battery health already dropped to 99% with only 29 charge cycles lets hope 17.2 resets it and fixes a couple other bugs cos there's a few
Thanks for sharing. I’m looking forward to iOS 17.2. Blessings on your day!
Still wait for fix the iphone 15 series camera out of focus problem
I wish the new updates would allow you to choose colors for background and fonts for iMessage.  I wish it would at least give you the option for the font to be black instead of white when an android messages you with the green background bubble. It would be so much easier to see.
Is apple going to add the charge cycle counter to other phones?
Are you comparing digital zoom ranges for each update or optical only? 12:45
Great video, I can translate it to our language thanks to the English subtitles you added, thank you. Unfortunately, automatic subtitles do not translate our language.
On my 14PM my battery health went from 88% to 86% 😅 might stop using betas for now
Having a great experience im my ecosystem
Love your videos sir keep it up ❤
Why can I see your YouTube videos in PIP, while those of other users don’t?
It gets slightly heaty if you put in your pockets long enough, even when you didnt use the phone, or even the phone powered down
Thanks❤
Lightning to Sd card is buggy on 17.1.1 sometimes it reads, most of the times not. Needs a couple of reboots to fix
Am I the only one who think iPhone 14 Pro is draining pretty fast in ios 17.1
I am still having Bluetooth issues with my car where it wont stay connected using iPhone 15 Pro Max.
Have you mentioned the local awareness feature in iOS 17.2 yet?
I wish live voicemail came to the UK as it’s currently available in the US and Canada so I hope live voicemail arrives in the UK in iOS 17.2
Typing lag, WiFi issue, frame rate drops in games, notifications don't appear or notify me... Using iPhone 15 pro.
I really wish Apple would focus more on iPadOS updates. It feels like they have completely forgotten that iPadOS 17 exists. I’m still waiting for Apple to add more Animojis too.
I’m on 17.1.1 on my 64GB XR. It’s so worst since iOS17. My phone is lagging like crazy! Just playing YouTube 4K makes the phone slow. In general UI, Home Screen and other basic processing has become way too low.
Someone pls suggest me how can I get to my iPhone being iPhone? Feels like I’m using an old android. 
Yes, I have done all types of reset and it has just wasted my time and nothing else.
Second
First
Got your notification aaron



iOS 17.1.1 is Out! - What&#39;s New?


How can I get my apple emojis back
This is a mess I mean 17.1.1. It shame
Hi! Why is the astronomy app running in the background, even though I am not using it?
17.1.1 isn’t updating on my iPhone it’s said unavailable to verify update tried everything
I really do t care much about these
HOPE THEY WILL ADD "LOCK APP"
Mobile heat more than before while camera use and charging.
Best update for 12 pro max , battery drain issue fix 🎉
There actually is a new feature which is on by default and most people wouldn't want this on. It is called Namedrop. It allows anyone nearby to hold their phone near yours and allows sharing of contact info. I don't want anybody to get info off my phone. You can turn it off by going in settings, general, airdrop, bringing devices together.  Change to off.
And bro posted this at 4:20 AM 💀
Was that a photo?
I do not like this update  it changed the way things look I wish I could change it back.
My notifications on my Home Screen just say “notification”,,, the actual notification doesn’t show,,,,?
I'm glad they fixed the wireless charging issue in BMW. Dad and I rented a BMW recently for a road trip and noticed that the wireless charging pad wasn't working but the phones got very hot. From there we charged with cords and it worked fine. Glad it didn't damage our phones!
When i click on a app it gives me a lot of options it’s kinda weird.. Can someone help?
🚗🔥🔋
i shouldn’t have updated
The new app notification sound is terrrible
My i phone 15 volume button doesn’t work sometimes every time i need to restart it … this is soo irritating please suggest some solution please also I’m facing automatically speaker on problem when i call someone.
Make video about all the new  keyboard features and what they do.
What bothers me is that after I downloaded this update,I got a pop up that would alert me about how close my phone is to my face.if anyone has this or knows how to disable this please tell me! My model is iPhone XR
Unlock logo stays longer time one time in Dynamic Island. It’s having some bugs I beleive
Can you ask them to add .5,1.5,2.5,3.5 to the volume so there is something in between low volume settings
biggest issue!!! getting a call therew is a new UI and if you have and earbud, it switches back and forth from earbud to phone speaker, making earbud useless and hands free usless
This update is trash they did not need to shuffle everything around like they did
Battery is total garbage
I updated it and my wallpaper's blur effect is gone
I’m having issues with Apple Pay! I can’t access it!! I need it!!! Please help!!! I’m using a IPhone 13!
A very unpleasant interface. The shadows in the apps are ridiculously stupid. The bulged clock is bad, and the Safari browser is unnecessarily complicated
Why did they mess with the text messaging. Looks like shit!. I liked the bar with the different options right where you can see them. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Facing Notifications issues in this update.
My 23’ Nissan Altima SR would charge for maybe one minute and stop . Getting extremely hot
Everyone is praising this update meanwhile my phone runs like absolute garbage once the update was applied. It lags all the time and even when I’m typing fast on the keyboard the screen freezes a lot. Anyone else running into this problem??
There Is No GIF With The New Update🤨😩😣
my phone doesn't ring, the volume is very low and it doesn't work, there is a lot of problem with this part because I don't hear it when someone calls me 🤯
Supposedly the new ios 17.1 software update overheats iphone a little
I am having trouble charging my phone since the update.  I have a 14 pro max. Even after leaving it plugged in all night.
My phone just updated to 17.1.1 a bug I have found. I assume it’s a bug anyways is if your using a headset like my AirPods and your on a call. If your screen locks and you tap the screen it opens to the call which is normal. However when you swipe up to open your phone it hesitates for a second the screen goes black and then it go to the normal Lock Screen where I have to swipe up again to get into my phone. Very annoying
Battery draining more than before
I've had the 15 pro max for less than 2 weeks, currently on IOS version 17.1.1 and I think the device's battery drains quickly.
Why hasn’t my iPhone 11 notified me of 17.1.1 while running on 16.7.2? I had to go to General/Software Update which I never had to before.
Do anyone else show an unknown Bluetooth connection that you can’t delete
My iphone 11 stops at 13% when i charge it.ios 17.1.1
My iPhone 13 Pro battery life was crazy good on iOS 17.1. I actually did NOT want to update to iOS 17.1.1 but my phone automatically updated overnight even though automatic updates and downloads is turned off.  My battery drains so much faster now. It’s been a few days and hasn’t gotten better. This sucks!
Just updated my iPhone 12 ProMax and it glitched my Do Not Disturb which stayed on for several hours after its scheduled closure. 
I missed an important phone call and app alert.
This is a similar issue to one from about 2016.
Ever since I updated my I Pad with 17.1.1 I cannot use camera to use Apple gift card.  Can’t even enter manually enter.  I can’t send messages via I Pad.  All of a sudden my I Pad is crap.  Can only blame it on the latest update.
Right anyone my fucking silent mode vibrate don’t work after updating please help so phone on silent and get messages doesn’t do anything don’t vibrate I ain’t have my
Phone on loud 😂😂 pls help
How do you get the background of the lettering when you speak text to stop tracing the words with a bright blue light it’s killing my eyes. I hate iPhone for that.
All these iOS updates they need to add more games for iMessage play
Bro I haven’t updated my iPhone since iOS 15. something and for some reason my iPhone updated my  iPhone to IOS 17.1.1 but without me actually doing it myself wtf. 😡
There’s a lot of new features to this update that ur not talking about they changed some text features and when u video call u also noticed u can do cool reactions in video calling
I’m running ios 17.1.1 and battery going down too fast , iPhone 14 pro max with 93% performance.4 hours only from 80 to 10%
I think this update will slow down the old phone, n that’s the aim
Secondary  sim not working after 17.1.1 update 😢
Ughh I hate all these useless updates . I wish I can just opt out but it won’t let me . I have an old iPhone 13pro, it doesn’t concern me. I don’t have a bmw or Tesla. I’m not rich like that . If I had an extra $50.000 I’d buy implants that I desperately need.
Will ios17 delete my music from my music app? Does anyone know?
Why is my update 1.22GB?
I'm on 16.7.2, I've been holding off since I've noticed many complaints about the new update. 

(I just purchased my iPhone 14 Pro a couple of months ago, brand new.)

 Is it stable enough to update yet or hold off until 17.1.2?
Hey hi Zolo tech I am from India I just bought iPhone 15 Pro Max and using it almost about six hours. I can feel some warm Ness in my hands by using basic task. Is it normal with 15 promax is the heating issue is not being solved.
Ios 17.1.1 i am confused with this update .i update this before two days but my mobile iphone 15 plus's battery is draining very fast 😂please don’t do this update if you don’t have any bugs
Iam on 16.7.2 in 14 plus thinking to update when 17.7.2 comes😂
I updated my brand new iPhone 15 Pro Max to 17.1.1 and now there is a problem with touch response. If I touch the screen it takes 1-2 seconds to wake up. Please help to fix this
I’m experiencing a Do Not Disturb bug. It doesn’t silence notifications when enabled.
Ios 16.8 users in chat?
They changed the notification sound, at least now you can't hear it. It's too quiet and doesn't notify you properly. Joke.
This is my ideology and i might be wrong.
The moment you buy a phone from the store, i must work perfectly fine.
Thats what i do in general.
Am using my 14 pro that i have never updated.
More than a year am still running the IOS 16.5 and my phone works mega awesome
Does still 15 series has heat issues..
Just took 2 1/2 hours by 3 carrier techs to download and install and transfer from broken X9 to better X9.  I tried to do it my self and spent almost 4 hours trying to transfer data from one phone to the other.  The big hangup was 17.1.1 trying to get it to install.   Arrgghhh
I started having an issue with face id not working at all and not being able to set it up after the update 😢
wifi connection is bad :(
the vibrant thing is even fixed in ios 17.2 beta 2 so this will be another bug in the list of what they will never fix
It’s actually strange that apple can fix overheating issues in software updates…. Makes me use my imagination and think about some super villain tech guy working for apple can just one day decide to release a software update that melts all IPhones.
This one really fucked up my phone.  It won't connect to my CarPlay with Infiniti.   And won't stay connected to my WiFi.  I've had to reboot it about 5 times today already.
Hello guys, can someone tell me please for iPhone 13 Pro Max: is it safe to stay on iOS 16.7.2 or update to iOS 17.1.1.?
I am a bit scared of some issue ..😊
Apple Pencil not getting connected after this update.really bad
isn't the flashlight feature at the top new? i didn't have it before. when your flashlight is on, it shows a little flashlight 🔦 symbol at the top in the black bar.
The update is terrible as one fundamental feature has a bug. Notification sounds do not work. I'm not certain if it's when it is in always display on or when the screen is locked. I am only able to know the notification when my watch has haptic feedback. iMessage notification sound can be heard on MacOS but nothing from the iPhone.
REALLY LAG ON IPADOS 17.1.1 IPAD PRO 2018
Hi 👋
Can you help me with my problem, Aaron? My iPhone 13 Pro Max is stuck on "Verifying update..." for hours now after downloading the 17.1.1 version, when I try to install it, it takes forever  on "Verifying update...". Please help
My volume button giving problems especially in what’s app
how did he make the app icon on the X Twitter app blue ?
Anyone else notice that you can now save a full website page screenshot to your photos, used to be only as a pdf
Bluetooth issues for me in my car with this update. Connects slowly and disconnects and reconnects at random. 13pro
Magnifier feature is missing while editing screenshots..
My 14 pro max after updated to 17.1.1  has over heating issue after a couple of days 😂
Keeping 17.1 for now. It been very smooth and battery are top notch. iPhone 13 pro user 😁
I regret updating to 17. I got screen touch problems and delay on my 12pm….
I’ll turn the volume all the way down and then it randomly turns itself back up. Super annoying
My BMW wireless charger hasn’t worked since the day I bought it anyways
In IOS 17.1.1 on my Iphone 15 pro, i used to charge daily before this update, by evening it would be at 20%, but now after update i charge 80% before goint to bed and the following day in the eveing berore going to bed the same time am at 50%, Just using the phone full time but not a heavy user, like gaming,  but just calling, whatsapp, music, audio books full time
i’m sure I’m gonna get a bunch of judgmental or rude comments here cause that’s just what the Internet is like now but it’s kind of funny for anybody who’s been paying attention the iPhone 15 is the first model in a long time to have the amount of issues that it has the issues I am talking about are all the overheating problems btw
0:26 what watch face is that??
My 15PM is randomly overheating with this update! Anyone else? 

My phone becomes crazy hot in my pocket at random times, and only stops when I unlock and lock the phone!
I hope finally apple focus on bugs with next updates. We just need of bug fixes, no more new features :/
is anyone here have issue when bringing the control panel down and put it back, the battery and signal indicator jumps and go back to normal. IOS 16 is good
How is the battery life compared to ios17
I regret updating to iOS 17 on my iPhone 14 Plus because of the worse battery. iOS 17.1.1 is way better than 17.1 in terms of battery but still not as good as what I had on iOS 16.
Getting my iPhone 15 pro max in less than 2 hours!!!
Been running 17.1.1 for several days on iPhone 15 Pro Max.  Testing internet speeds on 800 megabit internet, comes in around 400 on this while iPad is over 600.  I just turned off the always on screen setting to have the 15 crash and reboot.  Turned the always on back on and it’s good again.  Hope 17.2 fixes these!  I don’t run beta.
Even though I have automatic updates turned on it won’t install automatically. Can anyone help?
My iPhone 13 has been experiencing more bugs since this update 😥
Is it just me or does the 15 pro max battery drains fast?
Used for few hours on social media, dropped quite fast.
This update is draining my battery life 😢😢
This update is causing my phone to get quite warm when using certain apps. The camera app heats it up really quickly. Also been having weird display animation glitches, when trying to wake up the screen, it kind of stutters some of the time. Auto Brightness also sometimes just steps up as opposed to ramping up gradually. For my use cases, this update is a regression.
There was an annoying frame rate drop when pulling down the control center that would make the whole ui laggy and stuttery but seems to be gone with ios 17.1.1 so that's a plus for me🫡
I started having volume control issues after updating. The volume button works and it indicates the volume is changing on my display but the sound doesn’t change. With each increment of pushing the volume button to lower it the sound jutters but stays loud.
I think any iPhone from the 14 and above should have that battery cycle feature
Yesterday I updated to ios 17.1.1 and battery starting to drain so fast. In 17.1 it only costs 1% during night till morning and now it costs 4% . That breaks my heart. Phone model is 15 plus
It would be amazing  have function to edit phone number in dial screen. I don't get it. How it is even possible to not have that option?
👍
Still, keyboard lag isn’t fixed.
My iPhone 15 Pro Max is only a month and a half old and the Battery Health is at 99% now. I blame iOS 17.1.1! I only use official Apple chargers and have only 48 charge cycles.
My iPad pro m2 lags after 17 did they fix gaming
Great info thank you
My iPhone 13 mini is heating up and freezing a lot since this update. Anyone else?
How do you fix on YouTube. When it say something went wrong, try again.
❤❤
How do u update power Beats Pro
One of my iPads is suddenly getting a password incorrect Enter the Password for the exchange account box each time I look at mail. Will not take my email password
Aaron, I have a ipad pro 11 gen4.  Is it ok to leave it plugged in all the time and while using it?
I don’t have this update
Anyone else’s network (Wifi & Cellular) extremely slow after the update?
My control center always drops fame on ios17 who else is experiencing that
Hii i have iphone 15 and i bought it on sep 25th my battery 🔋 health is on 99% should I worry about this? Pls help 🚨
Ever since going from 16.7 straight to 17.1, my battery has been as good as since the first year I had the iPhone and my battery health is no where near 100% either. So I'm impressed. I do my 80% charge from 30% and in those 50% I get 4-5 hours screen on time. So I'm pleased. One major reason that users should never update their phone immediately, when a new ios update becomes available. That's even if Aaron is not having any problems, doesn't mean anyone else won't. So, I usually like to wait until as early as October to update and I'll never update immediately. Ios 18 I will not update until at least 18.1 or further. Because I know for certain that there will be a battery drain problem. When I updated to 17.1 it did drain faster than usual. But after a simple restart, it sorted it. A simple restart does not resolve the issue when updating from 16.7 to 17. Only further on after a few new updates
03:53 I hate this error!!!! And I’m tired of this mistake
Did anyone notice this small change: When in lock screen, top right you have WIFI Battery etc, there is now a White Line under those icons?
It should be a law that they disclose everything clearly telling you whats being fixed. Why the secret on not telling you whats being updated. Might explain why order model iphones are having issues. Iphone 12 pro max here and i noticed cell service is about non existent when on wifi it lags as if its trying to load then poof it starts working etc

You know apple is throttling older phones in order to get people to move up… a bit suspect when they wont disclose security issue updates who knows what they are throwing in with it.

Kind of like how our government hides extras in bills when they want money
Is there going to be a 16.7.3 update do you think?
17.1.1 screwed up Car Play and Bluetooth streaming in my BMW. I have disconnected and forgotten the wi-fi connection for the car as well as the Bluetooth connection to re-pair the phone with the car, and neither the phone or the car are discovering each other. 😢
I all most melted my phone chip on accident from a MagSafe charger lucky there fixing the problem because the phone will over heat then it will melt
instead of showing ipadOS 17.1.1 update, it’s showing me iOS 17.1.1.
Idk I unplugged at 7am it’s 9 pm something now. And I’m at 56% was using Facebook CarPlay and texting all day 🤷🏾‍♂️ with a little bit of youtube
I'm using IOS 17.1 in 14pm and facing that when I'm connected my phone to Bluetooth speaker and someone call me so there is no sound coming from phone neither from speaker
i am on ios 17. really want to downgrade to ios 16 at least. for gaming, it is not the best experience. at least on pubg. i thought the chipset was the issue, but people that is using a11 has no problem, so a12 should be no problem. i wish there is a easy process to downgrade.
I desperately need them to fix SIRI. I’m mobile every day all day courier. SIRI cuts off before completing reading the text. When I dictate, SIRI will not complete the read back. Very dangerous for me read text while driving.
When are we getting Journal on iPad /Mac with non-beta test ? What’s the delay?
Can’t connect to iphone 14 pro’s hotspot after updating to ios17.1.1 from my mac and ipad.
If we use a Camera in third party app like WhatsApp, camera does not switch to macro lens. Close photos are blurry
Exactly! They should make sure the updates should be checked to make sure it eliminates the bugs. Makes no sense to do it otherwise! I’m so fed up with all these bugs..
The 80% optimised charging feature has stopped working on my 15 pro max. Has this been fixed under the latest IOS update?
If the update hasn’t fixed 
my text and call tones 
being muted, I’m out.
Does it fix the turn signals not working on bmw
min 6:22 another glitch software, look at Font under Keyboard section. Apple's software stability needs to step up a lot his level! Lots of little things here and there that compromise the experience!
Thanks for the information. I always appreciate your clear, matter of fact videos. No screaming, Good information this clearly. Where is the best place to head to let some know about some glitches?  While watching YT videos and scrolling down the screen flips to an open Google page on my iPhone 12pro max.
I just updated to 17.1.1 and do not see a modem firmware update...13 Pro and modem firmware still at 3.10.02
Question can we charge our IPhones while overnight?
My iPad says "iOS 17.1.1" 😶
Is this just for 15 models? I have the 14 pro max and I don’t want to do an unnecessary update?
This update breaks connecting my phone (13j to my MacBook. Phone no longer shows up when connected.
Just tried to update my iPhone 14 Pro Max 17.1.1 and it’s bricked my iPhone !!!!!! Can’t boot or switch on  phone as it’s in the logo loop it’s switches on and off by it self . 
Now I find myself without my iPhone for work Tim Cook you should be fired!!!!!!!im sure that Steve jobs would agree with me
@zollotech hi
I have question I can’t update my iphone on iTunes
I notice it affected my vibrate and ringer . Even it’s on high can’t hear it or feel
17.1 no issue  17.1.1 nfc pay issues..... iP12
iOS 15 was solid. iOS 16/17 is trash. Stuttering when scrolling etc.. Animations not buttery smooth. (iPhone 14 pro iOS 17.1.1)
Every time I blink, there’s a new update..geesh apple WTH
Wasn't iOS 17 supposed to be the stable bug-free release?!
anyone with top speaker crackling/rattling on 15 line up ? it’s driving me crazy
Ios17.1 makes my iPhone 14 lag
They finally fixed the battery issue, I have 13 pro max and with the new update I couldn’t be happier
I will get this update tonight
I did not notice any modem firmware update on 14plus
why are there so manu bugs? I was honestly thinking of switching from android to ios this year. I'll probably switch anyways. But this is making me want to hold out a bit more till things are a bit more stable
Please let us know about the updates to watch os.
Why is charge cycle on available on newer iPhone? This is discrimination 😂
I updated my Powerbeats Pro last night, it went quite smoothly
Huzzah! This one fixed the pesky notification bug for me.
The camera hangs while recording.
All apple does is keep updating google phone doesn’t have this
Hi it would be nice to have the watch and iPad update please
Well here's a major bug.  I just completed the update and now my touchscreen features don't work.  I have no way of unlocking my phone and can't reset it because the phone wants to call emergency services if you hold the buttons.  Any ideas on how the restart the phone without calling EMS?
If you're a beta tester for 17.2 is there any way to get 17.1.1 without losing your data? photos and videos etc
iOS just brakes the phone these past 2 years.
Zollotech - Are you using a Pro Max?
Since Ive updated to iOS 17.1, my CarPlay in my BMW has stopped connecting! Which is very frustrating. I’m hoping they address this soon.
So when there's snow coming I get a white sort of square on my home screen for the weather starting soon. I tried to send it to you but no attachment.
of course, remember that when you get to 59 full, your battery will drop to 99%🤣🥳🥳
How many of us would roll back to 16.7 if we could…
Watch OS 10.1.1 brought back the Blood Oxygen icon on the complications on my series 7. Now to see if battery life improves…
Mr. @zollotech. I have a iPhone 12 pro max and my airpods pro 2 often disconnections from the phone in the middle of me listening to Music and sometimes on the phone. It suck having to manually reconnect each time. Any tips on how to fix this  other than update the iOS and disconnect and reconnect the pods to my phone?
i have iphone 12, when i scroll down to controll center, its kind of destroyed(((( order of those controls are changed now and cant fix it, anyone else have same issue?
I’d just updated to iOS 17.1.1 the main bug is occurring in this update is slow internet even on wifi or cellular while iOS 17.1 doing fine. My device is iPhone 14 Pro
What the hell is happening with apple lol, ios was the  most stable os before now it is buggy and bad
Let’s get them to fix the Maps not functioning when connected to CarPlay.
It’s crazy how apple haven’t fixed all these issues yet. They’re supposed to be the king of software and this should not have happened at all. Crazy to say one ui has less bugs atm. Never thought I’d say that
Bug fixes are MOST important. Features are nice but completely useless if the device software or hardware is defective. Pretty straightforward.
for those who were devices may some bugs consider that your device previously on ios beta, im using iphone 14+ but i dont have any bugs experience such as wifi cellular or even widgets, the one that i notice a bug on my device is sometimes may clock widget are invisble then after i off the screen and on again then the widget are back again..
Apple music volume low after 17.1 update
How about wifi 6e? Can you speedtest?
Having problems with notifications sound on the lock screen with certain apps, the apps are coming up on the phone, but no notification sound
iOS 17 is a disaster
This keyboard is laggy as still on iPhone 13pro
I am not being funny, but updating software every 2 weeks this is not what I want to do... I have been an Apple customer for years, but slowly I am getting fed up with all these updates! Update after update. 🤮
i just updated all of my devices, from the computers to ipads and watch/iphone for our home. love these general videos like your reviews and comparisons.
the same kind of video for mac os update would be very nice
what notification option do you use....cant get mine to look like your demo, thanks
Why the new version of macos ventura 13.6.2 is only available for macbook pro and not macbook air?
Please can you do a video for watch iOS new release that goes along side this one. Thanks
Appe needs to address their iOS before they release iOS 18 as it has been not the best start for iOS 17
Apple is really going down the tubes. Apple Music I’m having skipping and volume spikes. Amazon app every time I open and or close the app my audio pauses for 2 seconds.
It would be great if changing wallpaper was not convoluted. Why do you get a menu instead of just using the photo selected? Come on already.
17.1.1 feels snappier
There is a huge bug, if your running YouTube and u put app on background the voice will get disconnected for a sec
Flashlight bug? Mine showing 10 hours Flashlight when it's off in every way there is. Seems like a big from iphone 1? 😅
Here's to hoping 17.1.1 has better battery life 🤞, because as it seems to be the norm now, 17.1 only made it worse, and mind you I'm on a brand new iPhone 15. It's amazing how the technology can get can better (or so Apple says) and yet these phones still always struggle.
I have a volume bug when on WhatsApp playing a voice note the volume can’t go up or down when the voice note is playing
Anyone has this bug with the airpods pro 2 not connecting automatically to iphone?  It shows up as connected but still plays with speaker until i manually reset the bluetooth
Zollo is always talking about stup!d additions on iOS updates. Can u tell apple to stop destroying old phones with new updates ? Like my 13 pro max was able to take me through the whole day but now I need to charge twice a day da fack. Tell dem to stop fixing shits and give us stable battery
for some reason i cant update my ipad 6 to 17.1.1 with macbook as it says that 17.1 is the final version. And I cant update it natively as ive made huge mistake of buying iPad with only 32gb
is battery cycle only available in Ip15?
Would be good if they add the battery cycle to all iPhones.
Just want to say that IOS 17.1 didnt fix keyboard lag at least on iphone 12. It´s been soo bad to use the phone... never had a bad experience with iphone but this update ruined my 12
Thanks for the info. Yes, I would like to see info on the watchOS update as well :)
My “Optimised Charging” hasn’t worked since ios17,turned it off & on a few times,still just fully charges,doesn’t hold at 80%
I hope they fix the Bluetooth issues it's really annoying when listening to music either on airpods and other connected devices like playing on my car
Does anyone know how to change the notification tone? It’s really soft and very poor. Specifically on Strava. Anyone? Please?
Yeah, because I was having some weird connectivity issues not just at work. I can understand at work though because the building I’m in blocks a lot of the signals but I was wondering what this SOS thing means
15.7.1 is the best update in history if you agree then like ❤
if Apple can break your battery and you have to buy a new one from them lots more money for them 😅
i hope they add in ios 18 that when ure watching netflix or something while facetime audio or video u can seperatly change volume for media and calls, not to be in call volume media aswell, sometimes i want to have movie louder than call volume but yeah its bad, and other thing when ur in call with someone media sounds sound so bad like its not hq sound, media sounds like someone is playin audio trough call or something its so bad, and one more thing when ur facetiming someone on audio call its says facetime audio, u switch it to facetime video and when u switch it u cant go back to facetime audio you can turn off camera but u will still be in facetime video and even when u both disabled cameras the camera thing on screen is still there and its such a distraction to me. i hope they do something about all of that in ios 18
Please guys coment your thoughts about this :))))
How can everyone say that u don’t mind about new features but u want stability? We have the exact same operating system since iOS 10 with emojis and Memojis adds every single year. U want stability? This is a cell phone that costs 2000€  not a relationship to appreciate stability. We want new features we are bored. Apple gives us the EXACT same phone the past 5 years. At least make the software anew…
Nice video as always. I had a worse battery live on my series 6 in watchOS 10. hope this will improve. 

Keep it up 🎉


Did you notice that in 4:03 minutes in your video the wallpaper on the 15 pro (max) which runs iOS 17.1.1 turned around? Before the blue part was in the lower right corner and since minute 4:03 in went to the upper right corner.
Wallpapers links
Hello! Do you know any app for video download on iPhone?
When is the journal app coming out?😊
Hi Aaron. I actually haven’t had the notifications bug since iOS 17.1 and nothing seems to have changed in the new update. This is on an iPhone 13.
I had 4G issues in EU on 17.1 where it would drop to 3G or EDGE but no internet connection and calls dropping a lot. I hope the modem update will fix that.
The stickers in IG are working now however the new version is terrible because you have to jump around first to select something, then to have it appear in the “recents” before you can put it in your message. Also if you have more than one Memoji set up you can’t select the same Memoji pose in a different style because the one in the recent list is never replaced.
Have you notice that when someone calling you and your Apple watch doesn't display the contact name but just the phone number. I wish Apple would fix.
I just updated to 17.1.1 on my 15 Pro Max this morning and the WiFi connectivity is buggy.
iPhone 12 didn’t capture n28 band
Just updated to 17.1.1 on 15PM and I find the phone significantly smoother while opening, switching apps and typing.
have they fixed the issue with some of the bluetooth devices not appearing?
Always on display not working properly om 15 Pro Max and there is absolutely no ICloud sync with Sonoma 14.1. And 14.1.1. As a lawyer I am very happy… Different version of files on every device…
Should i install on it on my IPHONE 11??😢
German software 🤦‍♀️
Yes. Please include watch and iPad OS.
Hope they fixed the shutdown/crashing 😡. Really getting sick of all these bugs. iOS has become unreliable!!!
But don’t have any modern update on iPhone 12 series if you update from ios 17.1 to 17.1.1
Yes, I agree with you, I would love a stable software nice video 👍
I refuse to install ios 17 until ios 18 comes out
Idk if anyone used reduced motion before iOS 17 but now when you long swipe up to view apps, the swipe left/right has bugs, it will scroll 2-3 app pages instead of just 1
Just updated my 15PM to iOS 17.1.1. The volume bug especially when running a video sent on iMessage or WhatsApp is still persistent where the volume buttons don’t respond to any change in volume while the video is playing. Hopefully this is fixed in further updates and we can expect some stability improvements soon.
I have a problem with gps on 15 pro   It put me 400 km from my location and its only on my phone my wife phone shows the correct location.
Never had a issue with iOS bugs mentioned here but the way notifications work is still rubbish, 18 needs to fix that.
Me enjoying my iOS 16 😂😂
So this update is basically just for those who have iPhone 15?
Maybe, I think apple also became like Nokia A few years later.
No body use in the future. 
Because apple now makes many bugs.
Many people facing problems.
No wonder Apple is losing money. I’m sick of them and their instability. I’m going back to school soon and I can’t afford to be dealing with this. It’s been a bad run but I think I’m gonna give Android a try. At least I get a z fold flip design.
Hai
But my phone running IOS 17.2 what’s mean this
To be honest, I do not have a wireless charger in my Mazda CX-30 (also don’t at all), but I could only imagine how hot it could get sitting where I imagine if in the center, is basically on top the transmission? I can’t imagine being right about that, it does seem possible.
17.1.1 on 13 pro
Please make a video on macOS Aaron
idk if this is fixed yet in 17.1.1 but on 17.1 when I would play my music to my car's bluetooth, when the music advanced to the next song it would just become muted and I would have to reset the music app to resolve the issue.
Hope this one fixes her up
I hope 17.1.1 turns out to be a good one.
I think it probably was just an sos update to fix car wireless charging so no car or iPhone catching fire… that is imo a series one.
Also modem “connectivity” issues seems were worked on as the modem number is different
I have a problem with Maps; when I try to download any map offline it freezes, me and  my wife are on 17.1 on 14 pro and 14 pro max, respectively. Her’s doesn’t have this issue. I tried to uninstall and reinstall maps, and managed to download to first map but then, it happened all over again.
getting a bug free but with less feature  has always been one of the main USP for apple. however post steve jobs era, things stared changing. as ppl are experiencing pleanty of bugs in initial iterations of every software releases accross the board, be it mac os, ios, ipad os or watch osspecifically handling  notifications , be it notification sound, haptics, or many at time receieving notification has been a terrible issue even in ios 16 as well. pleanty of 3rd party aps like youtube, facebook, amazon, netflix either do not receive notifications, or even if the notifications come, they are completely silent. no sound and haptics, just the banner appears on the screen. and with ios 17 the reminder notification sound got changed to rebound, which can not be changed... thats something which is unacceptable. may be someday they will fix it with groundbreaking solution un ios 239!! one thing is evident, providing customisation option is not apple's cup of tea, let that be a android specific thing, atlease bugfree software any customer should expect.
Bring stability and battery life back the features are lame and not worth it!!
Hope this fixes the battery issue. Phone doesn't even last a whole day now anymore when before it would last at least 3 days before I had to recharge again.
What’s the stability of iOS currently compared to the most current build of Android? Just curious as I may switch back to Android for my next phone. Pixel phones seem to improve each year, might be a consideration for me considering I like mostly stock software.
will it be nice if i downloaded the 17.1.1 on my normal iphone 14 or no?
Yes do Apple Watch, macOS and/or tvOS. Thanks for your videos. Love the channel
Please do a video on watchOS 10.1.1 & please inform us if the battery draining issue has been fixed. I’m hesitant to upgrade my Ultra (gen 1) because of how terrible 10.1 was with just nuking the battery. Now removing MobyFace fixed the issue and I see the iPhone MobyFace app has been updated recently but I haven’t redownloaded it to my Watch. I’d like to know if it is safe to redownload it & if 10.1.1 has fixed the battery drain issue with MobyFace running on the Watch. Thanks!
wasnt iOS 16 and 17  just supposed to be focusing on stability??? ios 18 needs more features imo
Apple iOS is starting to resemble windows for some reason with all the issues its been having.
Books app now crashes 1 second after opening. iPhone 14 Pro Max, just updated to 17.1.1, force quit all apps, restarted phone, same thing.
No modem update for my 14 pro max
After that update, battery life sucks...also when Apple is gonna fix that damn charging issue? It stops charging at 80 even without the limit, annoying af!
Please put back the call screen icon.
These new updates really sucks ?????
Please put back the call screen icon.
These new icon really sucks
Don’t update! My iPhone 14 Pro  is stuck on Apple logo for 1 hr, tried to reboot serval times, I am a fool to update early, should have waited. It happened to my Ultra Watch on the 10.1 here we go again . I have no phone now, Thnx’s Apple.
Itunes not showing 17.1.1 udate still it’s saying ios is up to date
Guys do you think the battery is better on 17.1.1 or 17.2 public beta ?
We consistently have issues sending text messages with pictures to non-apple users.  We are using the iPhone 15 Pro Max on 17.1.1.  Anyone else having this issue?
The notification issue is so frustrating. My two phones are fine but my wife's phone has the issue. No resolution for this long is inexcusable.
👍👍👍👌
Is anyone else having a bug where the timer sets off at random? Been having the issue since I got the phone have factory restarted the phone twice trying to reset the software.
Can you test if the IOS 17.1.1 fixed the Lightning to SD Card reader support?
How do I upgrade macSonoma 14.1.1 to macSonoma 14.2?
How come when he says there is a carrier settings or modem update, I never see one… is it because of eSIM or I’m on AT&T 15 Pro Max?
iPhone 12 Pro has lot of bugs after 17 hopefully they fix it soon
I hope they fix the markup function on pictures.  The undo key hasn't worked since the release.
Tell me why ALL iPhones are taking selfie IR pictures every 5 seconds ? Get out your IR camera, most security cameras have IR cameras also? Why? We can not see in IR. Is there something around us that can be seen in IR?
Just thought I’d mention you have some of the greatest, vibrant and very high-quality wallpapers. Love them all.
Stanby time on this phone is very bad I lost 30% during the night
Still Facing Heating issue after Ios 17.1 Update in Iphone 15 pro max
0:42 I just updated both iPhone 15 Pro and Max to the 17.1.1 version and unfortunately both devices struggle to connect to my Wi-Fi router ( especially when the connection strength of the Wi-Fi signal is around 50 %). If connected both iPhones disconnect more often then on the previous (17.1) version! 😂
maybe I shouldn't update. my battery stays same % for 2 days on standby scared to update currently 17.1-- 15pm
Taking pictures with iPhone 15 Pro Max generates a lot of heat. Is it normal?
They need to “fix” their multi tasking
@zollotech - thanks for the update on iOS 17.1.1
4:20 how is this good news? They should fix the bugs on this releases since ios 18 is like a year away. This is like saying don't worry about windows 11 since next version would be better. I will still hold onto Ios 14 on my iPad that I use for work. I can't risk battery life and stability.
My iPhone 15 Pro Max definitely has the heat and volume bug which includes the ringer the alarm and tones, but I’ve also noticed my Apple Watch and iPad M2 Pro are both now charging HOT! Just went to pick my watch up off the charger and it was super hot. Couldn’t put it on my wrist!
🙋‍♂️🤗 THANKS ZOLLO…💚💚💚
Since I downloaded ios 17.
my beats fit pro are not performing well..
I will update when 17.2 comes out. Thank you tho
Another issue is that sometimes if I am talking to somebody on Speaker, my phone screen blacks out on its own.
Just updated !
Easily the best reviewer and explainer of iOS updates-me a Qualified Accountant FCCA.
What about us
iPhone X 😢
Finally a new beats update
Thanks!
Why only mention the iPhone models and not iPads or Watches?
I purchased Air Pods (USB-C) and i do not know what Apple did but noise cancelling isnt as good and bass is lacking as well. I do not think that sound as good as Air Pods (Non USB-C).
my iPhone 15 pro is already on 98% battery health with only 38 cycle counts, is it normal? I bought it the release day september 22
Whats new in 17.1.1 ?? Just drop off battery health 😢
Wifi bug still present for me on 17.1.1
Every year people say the next major update will focus on stability. Then it comes out being trash. Not very hopeful.
Well a buddy of mine is still on iOS 15 and I can see why, notifications since 16 are kinda bad.

I would like to see my notifications more than my background picture
I hope they fix the charging issue even when optimized battery charging is off it still stops charging after reaching 80%
From iOS 16 I have been having bugs, updates only resolve issues sometimes and then create new bugs days later. I will not be updating my iPhone until either iOS 17.2/3
Crapple has annoyed and disapointed me. Ive been an avid fan since the bullet proof 4. Presently 12PRMX 256. Ive carried over ringtones installed using itunes then. I used to install updates immediately, then after a few dissapontments decided to review before installing , where i found out i would lose my ringtones ive assigned to callers, and thus havnt updated since. I will jump ship when Elon lands Pi phone. I bet it will  be on another level. Crapple has lost direction, more interested in controlling its clients than improving the product. Im not gay , and dislike the gay faces on my ultra. We should have a choice to delete what we dont want. Android was a good idea, but proved shit compared to crapple. I bet Pi phone will be on another level. Remember my words.
Thanks Aaron
Update this phone! 😊
I'm on XR and recently updated to 17.1.. Is it better to update it to 17.1.1 now or best to wait?
Caller wallpaper not showing after the update. Not a fix update 😢
is it the wifi 6e already fix or no?
@zolotech, thank you for the update on information from Apple!
Well i still have WiFi connectivity issues, i should have never upgraded from the 11 pro max.
Ever since I updated to iOS 17 my AirPods stopped working
after updating i’m having issues with my airpods max, helpppp.  😭😭
iOS 17 is a disaster of an update. I have never seen such bugs remain release after release.
Wireless charging after being out for so long is still a joke. Give me a cable.
Hey I remember a few weeks ago your video showed more info on the weather widget on your home screen, is that only for 17.2? Keep up the great videos!
Always great to see improved battery!
Something I'll note here inasmuch as there may not be a watch os 10.1.1 video.  Having my heart rate appear on my watchface (I use the utility face) is important to me for health issue reasons.  It would no longer display (on my series 9) when 10.1 was installed.  That is fixed with 10.1.1.
The volume bug is still bugged smh , I don’t know if it’s happening with anyone else but on my iPhone 12 the volume would just go low for no reason then stay that way for a few mins then back to high volume . Not sure what it is but hope Apple fixes it . Also there’s a keyboard bug where it will stop typing or type really slow . Lots of bugs and issues hopefully Apple fixes em all
Does anyone else have an issue on Snapchat using an iPhone 15 pro max where when you use the front facing camera and the flash, the flash stays on for a ridiculous amount of time?
Still hanging out on 16.7.2 on my 14 pro and all is well! No bugs! 😃 Thanks for telling me about all the bugs with iOS 17. I will continue to wait until things are better like I always do! Maybe by mid winter it will be time to update!
You'd think a big corp like apple could release stable updates and have useable phones... My 13 Pro Max has been shit ever since I bought it new 😢
i've been running 17.2 beta 1 on my 14 pro max and i'm blown away but the stability! it also seems to have fixed a wifi connectivity issue i was having on my wifi 6e router specifically. I was also having really choppy animations on 17.1 and that seems to be resolved in 17.2. looking forward to beta 2 and more refinements and fixes!
For iOS 18 I just hope they focus on bug fixes and more customization options. Basically the reliability of iOS 15 with something big like the lock screen customization we got with iOS 16 would great imo
They are keeping you busy!
Power on and off sounds still not working.
Is it stable, 17.0.3 was horrible…..
I am on iOS 17.2 beta and after removing the reminders widget and attempting to add it back, my reminders are no longer appearing.   Others seem to have a similar issue.  I have to use the Fantastical widget for now.
How about carplay issues? Have they addressed it?
5G Standalone has came to my phone with AT&T. I’m on 15PM
I’m glad I didn’t update yet. I’m still on iOS 16.6
Last update i was very disappointed because i add lost of problems with the sound like on YouTube and connectivity 
I needed to turn off and on a few times a week very dessapointed with the sound
How about the laggy keyboard? My 15pm has this problem sometimes, its dissapointing for such an expensive device. Does anyone else experience this?
I hope next year is actually a stability update that is stable and has good battery like iOS 15 was. They need to make it more stable instead of release more features but have a lot of bugs
Still cant facetime on mobile data with T-Mobile :((
Thanks for sharing. I just updated all my devices. Blessings on your day!
I love your videos but does anyone really care about a build number? I skip that part I think it’s pointless
i have ios 17.2 and all my apps are broken
After this new update, Apple Music Listen Now, Browse Radio and Seach are now not working.  They continually try to load but nothing comes up.  This is becoming a real issue with Apples updates. When we finally get a stable update, I will not be updating after that.  A real disappointment from a company that should be Top of the Mark and is increasing coming down to Microsofts level.
Today I experienced my iPhone 15 Pro Max getting hot for the first time. It happened while using the camera, and I wasn’t even using it for that long. Could this be the new chip?
Phone is getting to hot to even touch. Maybe time to go back to the droid?
I’m on iOS 17.1.1 and there’s a bug where you attached a link for focus and once you turn it off or on it switches wallpapers it’s very annoying.
Just updated my Iphone 14. The notification tone volume is still quiet. Apple should have separate volumes for ring tone, notification tone, media, system like android has. Even the lock sound is on the quiet side.
I’d love to update my se3 from iOS 17.1 to 17.1.1 but it says I need 6.33 gb of storage (this happened from 17 to 17.1 too so I offloaded photos to iCloud). I have almost 40gb spare so what the hell am I meant to do? Apple have turned into a joke over the last couple of years. After over a decade with Apple I’m ready to move to android and that’s something I never thought I’d say.
Now I have to update everything tomorrow. 😂😂😂😂
I just love it on iOS 17.1.1 updates on my old iPhone 12 now <3
Yes less new features I will never use and more stability and battery life for iOS 18 👏🏻
Yes🎉😊👍🏻
Lets hope it fixes the severe battery drain. I have a 15 Pro running 17.1 and the battery life has been putrid ever since i updated.
What about the dim watch face at night on the Ultra 2? Has it been fixed?
I think Apple fixes a lot of things in the updates that they don't want anyone to know about.
Can anyone tell me if there Apple Music is being affected, last couple of updates it’s separating songs and duplicating albums. And some songs say unavailable in region? I can’t find anything to fix it
Im on a xr and noticed lot of bugs in apps like discord apple music and other stuff still
I just updated today, but on the 17.1, sometimes, it would reboot on its own during the day as well. My iPhone is the 12 mini.
i just updated my iPhone 14. i enjoy learning new things. i learn a lot from these videos.
my watch issues are the ECG, and blood oxygen compilations don’t show up on the watch faces but if you touch the blank spot they still work
Thank you for your wonderful video. I updated all of my devices. Thank you once again for you great videos. I always learn so much from you. Thank you again.😊
What  about battery on iOS 17.1.1 is there any better. I have iPhone 15 pm on iOS 17.1 but battery go down for 20% on night nobody use IT. Yestarday have 1h an 30 min active screen and battery drop from 100 on 69% i dont kona why this happend
Hope it fixes the bug of when it jumps to app switcher when you’re typing.
I wish Apple will release IPS version of iPhone 15,I really hate OLED screen I felt uncomfortable looking on it! 😢
Been waiting for this. Hope you have a wonderful night Aaron 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Great vid💯
Any updates to the bug where all my album art is wrong in CarPlay on my vehicle?    This has been going on for quite a while.   I have tried a couple of fixes I found on the internet but the problem keeps coming back
Wallpaper color issue. 😴😴😴
I want a quality of life mega update
Can u make a vid about Mac s please I appreciate it
not going to install unless it proves to be not lagging or heating up the device!!!
Had enough of bug problems for a long while!
Modem firmware is the same. 1.12.02
wallpaper download not working. just shows a blank page when i try to download autumn dawn
At this point it’s seems bugs are a new feature in ios updates
Still have issue with my Wifi connection, same with LTE and 5G on Iphone 12
Anyone having drop call issues after updating to 17 on 13 pro max?
I actually don't have any issues other than the battery life issues. (iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple watch series 7 and iPad Pro 2023)
I wanna see watch os 10.1.1 video
Thank you so very much for your content ❤😊 I haven’t seen any issues with my iPhone 15 Pro yet since I updated
Hi Aaron. I've been following you for a year and your videos are really making a difference on my iPhone 15 Pro. I have a question. How can I download the Feeback app on my device? Really appreciate your reply.
another update lol wth man
Jus updated and next moment boom Wi-Fi gone 
Let’s see how it hold up after sometime
Is the wallpaper linked in the description working?
Got my 15 pro max launch day and only have 29 cycles
Apple wake up you earlier 😊
Ios 17 battery is shit
Great content 😊
The flicker is noticeable.
i just updated all of my devices, from the computers to ipads and watch/iphone for our home. love these general videos like your reviews and comparisons.
Wallpaper link is broken. Wallpaper is not available!
Am I the only one missing the ability to change the airdrop sound ? 
And also i have sometimes the problem opening camera and taking a picture it does not take a picture but made the click sound. 
So I look into my gallery and there is no picture which I made. 
So I switch back to the camera but now the camera app is black and nothing works. 
Need to wait few mins until it works again or restart the iPhone
Just need to update my watch now:)
Is this only for iPhone 15 models because I didn’t get the update yet
Where is the beta 2 of iOS 17.2?
Anyone having the same problem?
Another great video from Aaron
what? I just updated my phone and my ipad before you made a vid 😂
So when I was updating my Apple Watch Ultra (1) to 10.1.1, I got a message that it had gotten so hot that it actually paused the charging. 🤔. I wasn’t having the battery drain issue to begin with and now I hope I don’t have an overheating issue.

My 15 Pro Max did just fine and didn’t get hot.
Got your notification aaron 1 minutes ago
What about changing  the wallpaper on the lock screen problem?
will it fix the mail app? i use it for a few minutes but it's still using battery in the background a lot

Influencers influencing consumer sheepskin to consume more . Is that all there is anymore? Nobody will work anymore everyone will just advertise ? This kids are doomed

😂 Omg it takes me back  we had one of those iMacs in my elementary school just sitting there for a whole decade (I’m not old, 20 years old) but it was so funny to me because how ancient it was and it was broken but they still kept it all that time in a room😂
Wow so real that I thought that it was real
I think Apple should try again with the camera considering the camera quality on the newer iphones
#BRINGBACKTHEEMATE
Lol

Apple wasnt a computer brand before then they starting to make the closthe and apple will never make their phone slim because is 2012 iphone goal to be the slimmest now the goal is businesses

😂I can't be the only one who thought the apple eMate looked like my grandma's sandwich toaster 😂but otherwise if Sarah doesn't mind ,could she please adopt me the documents are all ready all the way from SA I'll be your baby sister ❤😂
#BRINGBACKEMATE
your telling the the apple flip commercial wasn’t real i could of sworn it was actually the real commercial😭 i love your videos so much thank you for showing us these
Why does everyone keep commenting the same thing?? 😅😅I would never spend over $200 for a shirt like that as it’s nothing special lol
That Camera 🎥  📸 Came out when I was Born in 1994   I’m 28.  Turning 29 in November! ❤😁
Am l the only one that think all Apple old products are ugly 😂
Only true fans can like

Love yo sarah we appreciate you so much
dang the commercial for the apple flip was legit fire!
Just made my whole day watching this!!!!

Why is the entire comment section people being like: “I love your videos. I love Sarah. How can she pump out such quality videos so fast?!”
hi Sarah really you didn't know what a floppy disk was I´m feeling old right now I´m just 37  but I laugh a lot 🕷
Sarah is giving apple ideas right now😂
Her ads are better than most official ads that I've seen...love your vids Sarah❤
Omg you are the best

#BRINGBACKEMATE
Hi Sarah, Have a blessed day, and let the Lord bless your week. ❤
Please help me please 😢😢❤❤❤😢❤
Bro did not know what a iMac is
I still use floppy disks to update programs on older machines.🙂If it wasn't for old technology, we wouldn't have new devices today.
I’m 8 years older than you an I truly baffled how you didn’t see the iMac. When I was in middle an high school every school had the iMacs in the library. That’s how I got so hooked on Apple products. I use to skip class in 2010 just to get on them.
I'm certain this is what I suggested for a video idea 🤔
Strange I never saw them
#bringbackemate
I love you so much Sarah!

You now that where are in 2023 not 2014 you sed that it is 20 years old but if it is 20 years old and it is created in 1994 it will equal 2014 not 2024 so it is 30 years old. I am 10 years old  and i cane do my math beter than a adulte.

Heyy
First. Another amazing video to the most beautiful my idol ❤❤❤
I saw this at 8 seconds

M3 MacBook Air (2024) - NOT What You&#39;d Expect!


Ok - here's everything we know in terms of the 2024 M3 MacBook Air! And if you're looking for a great collection of problem-solving apps, look no further than Setapp! Get their FREE 7 day trial - https://stpp.co/zoneoftech9 (I pay for it myself and it's one of the very first apps I always install on any new mac)
So, should I wait for the M3 MacBook or buy the one currently on the market ?
Wrong the MacBooks are coming with touchscreens this time around not just chips you forgot ppl aren’t caring for the m3 chips this go around their sales are all time low this go around
Anything about the Apple Watch series 10??
As usual, a comprehensive collection of possibilities. Currently own the 15" IPA and I love it, but... Will upgrade to the M3 IF they have at least one more C port. If not, then not. Keep up the good work. THX; Bob
Hope they bump the ram and ssd on the base model for the M3. I hate how you have to go for 512Gb+ storage to get faster speeds.
Well I just got my m2 macbook air so fml 😂
M2 24gb ram air or m3 air for video editing on the go. I use Linux and Mac lol no windows.
How to get the wallpapers you've used in on your macs in the video
Not sure how you overlooked the existence of a fan on the 14 inch M3 MBP. Especially when these chips can drastically drop in performance when hot.
M3 MacBook Air will be a huge disappointment.
I'm just hoping for the M3 MacBook Air to be released in Space😂
Where can I get these wallpapers? (Desktop ones, I know there is an app for mobile ones)
All what I want to see is M3 chip in iPhone
Still the same design, RAMS, with new chip & improve display
🍏
THE M3 MACBOOK AIR NEEDS A DYNAMIC ISLAND.
Bro please make a new video on iPhone se 4th gen 🎉
OLED would be nice.
This may be sacrilegious to say.. But I think the M3 Macbooks have the potential to be one of the best mobile gaming laptops if Apple were to really take gaming seriously.. I've had multiple gaming laptops for the past 5 years and the 2 things I absolutely hate about them is the noise and the bulk.. Most gaming laptops, along with their chargers, are so cumbersome to log around that I barely consider them as portable, they're pretty much useless without a charger and they can get so noisy that you're pretty much required to use headphones.. The M3 Macbooks have the same performance regardless if it's plugged in, it's USB-C so you only have to carry one cable and power brick for all your things and it doesn't get as noisy as other Windows Gaming Laptops so you don't have to wear headphones if you don't want to..
snapdragon X Elite ❤️🔥💪
Snapdragon X Elite Laptop best for Everyone ❤❤
I just bought the base M1 MB Air a little over a month ago and by the sounds of it hearing how low-performing M2 and M3 is compared to M1, I'm glad I went with the M1. I don't have much to complain about other than ports. I would like to see either an SD card reader or USB-A, I don't need HDMI but that would be a plus. Other than ports, I have no desire to save up for the MB Pros.
I guess ill wait for 2026 🤣 I spent my budget for the m3 on something else.  Might take a while to replenish
I just don't see enough value in the Air to make it worth purchasing. I keep looking but really can not spend that muchmoney for a machine for casual use and light browsing. the  single monitor output is ot a huge issue but I can understand dua monitor support being important.
How do I get the wallpaperz on my MacBook like you guys?
Its a shame that microLED is not likely to be available in anything bigger than a watch for the next decade. It is very far behind in development.
How do you get wallpaperZ for MacBook?
Sooo… nothing new
I think I'm going to get a Macbook air with at least 8 TBs of storage.
I‘m holding onto my wallet until I get a new 12“ MacBook!!
Your comparison between the Macbook air with an m2 and a Macbook pro with an m3 is flawed as the Macbook pro has a fan which allows it to overclock.
Given the heat of the M3 Mackbook Pro with a regular M3 (and fan), they either add a better heatspreader than the M2 Air, or, the M3 Air will be heat limited.   

M3 also chokes on 8GB RAM, possibly because of dynamic cache; but even the M2 Air is pretty limited at 8GB.  Probably ought to take whatever "base model" price they advertise and add $200 for the 16 GB RAM upgrade with possibly another $200 just to get to 512 GB onboard storage to avoid the single NAND chip slow storage as well.
its not fair to compare a fanless m2 air with the m3 with real active cooling system...
I Was waiting for this Macbook air...but to be honest Apple Screwed the M3 up! The M3 is pure Crap - It went hotter than the M2 and almost every benefit comes from the higher clockspeed... 

The M2 already went up to 108 C Celsius....This is the Same temperature that the BASE M3 with fan is reaching!!!!!
There is no way this Air isn't going to be crap if they keep the same clock speed...and if they going to cripple it to 3.8GHZ to NOT MELT - I do not need that crazy new price for 5% more speed...
can i get ur wallpaper link please , its awesome ( the London map MacBook
 wallpaper)
I hope the 2024 macbook air has speaker grills. That was the main thing that was better on the m1 macbook air, compared to the m2 macbook air. So, I hope the speaker grills return. That's my main ask, for the new macbook air. We'll see. I hope the battery life is same or slightly better than the new macbook pro at 22 hours. If the new one is 22 hours or slightly higher, like 24 hours, then I'd get it. But, speaker grills is a must. The sound quality is just so much better with it
Can you stop and breathe for a minute? 

Something launches and you are already editing the video talking about the next one. 

You are the definition of consumerism.

Isn’t a iPad mini 7 coming in 2024?
Guys my new iphone 14 takes like 1 hour & 35 minutes to charge from 20%-80% with using original apple charger 20 watt. Is that normal? If it's problematic then is anyone else facing same thing?
M3 CPU + 16GB of RAM + MacBook Air 13.5-inch body is all most casual users need.
Literally just bought a 13" M2 Air on sale.  18 hours vs 19 hours and a couple of nano seconds opening Reminders probably won't be enough to sway me to upgrade. I think I'm more excited about  all the reviews!
12 Inch Macbook 2024 plox
1:14 huge improvement? Doesn’t the M3 MacBook Pro 14” have a fan while the M3 Air won’t?
No notch,,,,please, currently using m2 air 13”, i hate its notch. So ‘NO’ to that.
Thanks Dan 😊❤xx
What about a imac m3 pro max just like the MacBook m3 pro max??
All  want in the M3 Air is the Space Black Variant, that's all
Apple products are amazing even though I'm not having one😁😁

1st.🎉🎉❤



Day 32 Trying to Win an iPad at the Mystery Cup Claw Machine! #shorts #arcade #clawmachine


Bro Emoted twice 😭😭
Bro i told you maybe someone already as the a💀💀💀
the dances scare away the As
Have you considered that maybe there is no A in this claw machine?
I’m pretty sure that they’re just scamming you man
Am going to make a new account and subscribe to. @Arcade Warrior 😃👍
Try not doing the dance
This is the thing. I look forward to each day
iPd
Cringe
I saw the A in the thumbnail and had such high hopes! Also love the shirt and the series
You spent about 15 dollars a day 

15 x 32 = 480 so you spent 480 dollars on that machine
Just stop it they scamming u
You should not lick random dollars, dollar bills are often used for ingesting drugs and are quite frankly dirty in general
Keep on going
I can’t wait for you to get it man you deserve it so much
Manchild
I bet wen you win it’s just gunna be a bad old ipad
You can buy an Ipad with the money u wasted on this machine. lol.
Plssss can u put this comment in ur next video I’ve never had a shout out before in a vid 🥺🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺
Anyone notice the Millcreek mall?
I love thease vids keep it up!

I told you to put my comment otherwise you wont get an A
Print an “A” at your home!
YOU GOT 3 LETTERS WHEN I'M STRUGGLING TO GET ONE
he’ll win the A by Christmas 🎅
So have you spent $160 on it?
Cool Video
When will he win?????
I guess there's no A in the machine . They are making you fool 😅😅😂😂
Good try, Erik!
It is in the corner
Pt 197 of trying to win a a
Bro stop spending so much money on machine.  You literally have enough to buy iPad for 160 but you spent on machine that gives 79 dollar iPad which is bad. You been doing this for 32 days and spent 5 dollars each day which 32 x 5 = 160. You can buy ipad pro for 150 instead ipad for 79 dollars
Where is this arcade located
people who think there is no A 
👇
He is very good I like to watch his videos
One month already and no luck
I love this series once you find the A  can you do another one!!!
U need to show the dogs before the claw machine 😩
Thank you for ur upbringing videos! Also, I think there is only one “ a” in the. iPad claw machine
Eric my friend I know you will get the A very soon and I enjoy watching you try every day. I loved seeing you go to the pet store and look at the puppies. Your energy gets more positive with each video and I hope you never give up!!!
Nice dance moves!!😅 You did a great job and I’m glad the pups calmed you down
😅😅😅 keep it up!!!!
Your videos cheer me up
I look forward to seeing your video each day
Keep trying to win and don’t worry about the haters 😊😊😊
I love your dance moves
Omg the puppies were so cute!!!!!!

Cool dance moves bro
Cool video bro
Then you get 3 as and you win 3 iPads
I’m still gonna keep on cheering with my pom-poms on you, but you can do it I believe in you I’m sure that letter a was going to be here somewhere but it was amazing seeing how you put a smile on everyone else’s face including mine. I’m very appreciate that and also, hopefully that letter is going to be there soon. I bet thank you for everything you do from your friend life of hope 34.❤

iPad Pro: Teurer, Größer und eine Neue Variante!


Hab Dich gerade bei Galileo auf Pro 7 gesehen!!😎 Bin gespannt wo Deine Reisen noch hin geht.😂👍🏼
Lohnt es sich jetzt eine Ipad Air zu kaufen oder sollte ich lieber warten?
Glaubst dass Frühjahr 2024 das iPad Pro Ultra endlich mal released wird? Ich warte nämlich drauf… 12.9 Zoll würd auch reichen.. aber wenn ein größeres kommt. Dann würd ich darauf warten wollen :) würd es mir absolut gern kaufen.. das wär perfekt von der Größe her, das 12.9 Zoll ist etwas zu klein. Aber ab 14 Zoll ist es perfekt
Mein iPad Pro aus dem Jahr 2019 läuft immer noch wie eine Rakete. Ich kann es nur jedem empfehlen.
Ein IPhone Mini Pro 🤤 
Es wäre einfach DAS Handy!
Ganz ehrlich? Ich nutze seit dem iPhone 15 pro gezwungenermaßen Face ID und ich finde Touch ID zuverlässiger und man kann das iPhone liegenlassen für das Entsperren und muss es nicht immer leicht anheben, auch im Dunklen punktet Touch ID. Ich hoffe ja sehr darauf, dass bei iPhones irgendwann die Wahl zwischen Touch ID und Face ID kommt.
Alles größer gefällt mir nicht👎Japan❤👌
Ein iPhone mini Pro würde ich so feiern 👌🏻
warum noch kein micro LED  ? besser als mini und OLED , wird Zeit das Apple Konkurrenz bekommt damit dieses rumgefummelt aufhört uns scheibchenweise die Kohle aus der Tasche zu ziehen.
Ich will endlich ein iPad mini Pro mit 120HZ
Ein zukünftiges iPhone Mini Pro würde ich sehr begrüßen.
😎😈🍎🎸🤘
Hey 👋 Joel 
Danke 🙏 für die News 
Lg Sebi ✌
ich würde mir gerne das 12,9 zoll mit 256GB und cellular für die Schule holen. Soll ich lieber auf das nächste warten oder zuschlagen. und wenn, ab welchen Preis soll ich das iPad kaufen?
Wirklich gute und nützliche Infos, wenn auch viel Spekulation. Was aber m. E. gar nicht geht ist dieser ständige Popeffekt
Boa, dieses Vega Armband ist ja wirklich übertrieben nice! Leider ist es schon ausverkauft, kann man dich dazu motivieren es einem Waldsorfbruder abzukaufen?😁😁😁
@3:56 100%ig deiner meinung. Ich hab neulich vom 12 Mini aufs 15 Pro gewechselt und nutz das 12 Mini trotzdem noch gerne. Ein Mini mit Pro-Kameras wäre ein Neckbreaker für alle anderen Smartphones des alltäglichen Gebrauchs. So schade das sie es eingestellt haben.
Die Gerüchte zum iPad Pro lassen mich wirklich skeptisch werden. Ich bezweifle extrem, dass bei einem größeren Display mit 14.1“ ein billigeres Display verbaut wird. Das entspricht, meiner Ansicht nach, absolut nicht Apples Strategie. Und seid wann machen die sich Gedanken darum, ob ihre Kunden sich etwas leisten können? (siehe Preise von SSD und RAM)
Ich würde ein größeres iPad Pro im Lineup jedenfalls absolut begrüßen, aber Mini LED würde mich wieder überlegen lassen.
Apple wird on Südkorea immer bekannter, da sie oft berühmte Kpop Gruppen benutzen, um ihre Handys zu promoten, also wenn ihr "Idol" ein iPhone haben, wollen sie es auch 🤷
Ich hatte auch 2 Jahre ein 12 mini. Nur leider war die Akku-Laufzeit nach 2 Jahren nicht mehr praxistauglich, zu schnell leer. Bin deshalb vor kurzem auf das 15 Pro gewechselt.

Von der Größe her ist das Mini top!
Also ich springe erst wieder auf den iPad-Zug auf, wenn das iPad Mini 7 einen Smart Connector und das Keyboard Folio von Std. iPad bekommt (natürlich entsprechend verkleinert und mit ausklappbaren Stand) 😉 Das würde ich richtig feiern und das würde ich mir auch kaufen, denn für mich ist der Pencil in Notizen Geschichte, nachdem ich gerade vorgestern 5 Bildschirmseiten beim Sync zwischen iMac und iPad Mini 6 verloren habe 😕 Ich weiß nicht, wo die geblieben sind - sie sind einfach weg 😕 Und das fällt bei mir unter NICHT betriebssicher! Also Pencil schon zum Malen auf größeren iPads, aber sicher nie mehr zum Schreiben in Notizen 😕 Daher meine Forderung nach dem Smart Connector und einer kleiner Tastatur, damit man mit dem iPad Mini 7 auch wirklich mobil arbeiten kann 😉
Ich darf dich nicht mehr gucken 👀 
Jedes mal werde ich aufs Neue Hype und fang an zu sparen 😅

Deabo ist raus 😂

Ob wohl dann verpasse ich ja alles Mist 🤦‍♂️ 😅
schade, das iPad Pro 14"  mit OLED hätte ich gekauft! 😤  ...so wird's wieder das 12,9" 🤷‍♂️
Ich verstehe es nicht wieso Apple  nicht auf die Ipad pro  oder das Mac Os installieren wollen können das sollte doch schon lange gehen mit den chips
Cool wäre auch ein IPad Air mit 12.9 Zoll Display und M2 Chip
Ich will das 14,1 Zoll iPad Pro, aber bitte auch als OLED, sonst 😡😡
Touch id war immer müll und wirds auch immer sein
Da bin ich mal gespannt, bei jetzigen rückläufigen Käufen, ob diese astronomische Preispolitik weiter fortgesetzt werden kann (die Firmenkundschaft ist selbstverständlich ausgeschlossen, denn da spielt der Preis keine Rolle). OLED rechtfertigt nicht diese Vorgehensweise sonder sondern dient lediglich als Sprungbrett🤔
Wann gibt’s denn zum Studio was neues?
Kriegen die macs dann faceID wenn touchIDE stirbt?
Ginger räkelnd im Hintergrund - der Hammer 🙂
Ein kleines Device...🥰 100% zustimme 👌
Ein iPhone Pro mini, das habe ich mir schon immer gewünscht. in Kombi mit einem Ipad ein super lineup
Also bei ipads wirds langsame unübersichtlich….
mal ehrlich von den Funktionen und Nutzungen ist seit M1 Modell nichts dazu gekommen. Kaum KI / AI nutzbar oder derartiges Apps
Mini Pro 💯 Es kommt nicht auf die große an
Ich fühle mich wie ein Japaner.
Ich bin zwar kein Japaner, aber ich bin auch immer noch begeistert von den iPhone Mini Modellen. Ich geb mein 13 Mini im Leben nicht her! 🥲
4:44 bezieht sich das auch auf MacBooks? Ich finde touchID da wirklich viel praktischer als FaceID
das alte aufnahme zimmer wahr viel geiler zum kucken



The BAD news about the iPhone 15 Pro Max!


Which smartphone did you buy this year - and why?
Completely disagree. You don’t have to be an Apple person to have an iPhone and you don’t have to be a “Windows” person to have a PC. Actually for us in technology, we can have the best of all worlds and not be biased like this video 😂. I have an iPhone 15 pro and love my AirPods Pro 2 for work . And I have my Pixel 8 personal phone 🤷🏻‍♂️… I agree though, iPhone needs finger print reader NOW!
You are kinda correct.
been using for a month and really the battery sucks
What a good pose on the thumbnail.
Pose one more time. Kaching
Again. Kaching.
CrApple iShit
1:1 perfect copy  kisluxbag  
Perhaps it's an age thing but when I was younger I preferred android because it allowed me to tinker with everything. These days, I want a phone that just works every time, and I find iOS gives me that. Both ecosystems are much more mature now and there's pros and cons for either depending on what other tech is in your life. That said, buying this year's flagship phone, each year, is an expensive hobby, regardless of which you choose.  The hardware advances each year these days aren't what they used to be, thus I tend to get an older phone and keep it for several years because that's more than enough for what I need it to be.
Only issue with potentially eliminating the notch or Island is Face ID. I much much prefer Face ID to Touch ID. It’s much more seamless, easier, you don’t even have to think about it! Touch ID, and other finger print authentication, still works well but I have had issues in the past when my fingertips are dry, cracked, dirty, etc. 

And technically Face ID is more secure. 

I hope Apple doesn’t ditch Face ID, but rather find a way to put all the “tech” under the display. And just have a tiny hole for the main selfie camera, unless they can get that under the display too without affecting image quality. 

If they got rid of Face ID, I’d buy the latest version of iPhone with Face ID and keep that as long as possible before I’d buy an iPhone with just fingerprint reader again.
Dude, there is sooo much stuff on your page! 😡 Where is the Pitaka link?
I had the 13 Pro and am happy that I upgraded to the 15 PM
Love your video❤
Right on with all points.  I'm ashamed to say I own a 15 Pro Max, Ultra 2, iPad mini, M1 MacBook Pro, AirPods, Airpod Max and an iMac M3 desktop.  It's foolish.  I'm considering buying a Pixel 8 and inching my way out of Apple's walled garden.

Also, regarding the size of the phone, YES, I've had my 15 Pro Max since release and it's now beginning to irritate me.  I doubt I'll stick with it for another year.
Blaaaa! Blaaaa!
Lol I come to watch your video about it to find out your name is mine and that North Face shirt is what I currently have on
Another great video Mark, but why do you persist with the excruciating pronunciation of titanium as tyyyytanium? What next? Aluminum, hood, trunk….
I’ve got to disagree.
I don’t care about the ecosystem nor am I an apple person, yet I’ve bought a iPhone 15 pro max.
I want a big screen for watching movies and a good camera.
I also like the privacy Apple gives compared to android and that’s it.
I don’t have a watch or laptop from apple and never will.
I loved this video .yes you are righttttttt😅I’m Apple hooked .but I do wish the screen would be bigger .
Thank you Mark, you just saved me alot of money. I was going to buy 15 pro or PM, but now Im staying with my old ip12 :D
And to have stupid bugs for £1200 and the storage scam like £200 extra for 256gb extra is just ridiculous. These phones should be the epitome of resloved software, refined hardware and stuff like overheating chips and poorly thought out software ways is jist astonishing. And wasting battery health like 13% battery degradation in 10months on the 14p max and now 15 is sometimes lagging and like 99% the same like the 14p max
I upgraded i love it
I was so much into upgrading my iPhone 12 Pro to this. But after seeing your review I certainly know I’m no longer interested to upgrade this year anymore. Perhaps 16 series 🫡
Having worked with buggy software for 30 years, I can appreciate how well Apple software works and seamlessly integrates all of the products together. I have little patience for the android mess of apps and sloppy software.  There’s also security concerns with android products , which are a hackers delight.   Apple does not have these issues.   Maybe you can comment on software QA of Apple and the imitators of android .
Waffle
Isn't the trick, to buy the phone, when the next model comes out. That way, the price goes down considerably?
Yay 🙌🏽 us iPhone 13Mini users had a little mention 😊 love my 13Mini ❤
Come to trade in I got £515 for my 13pro max against the 15pro max directly from apple .  Lucky if you get £200 for an android phone. Not disrespectful to android. So apple do hold their value.
Thanks!
Build quality is "the best on the market"???? 😂😂😂😂😂
Ahahahhaha.
Everything’s more expensive because of our incompetent sleepy Joe. Trump 2024. He is our global, civic savior.
hi! may i know what camera you are using for your youtube videos... i asked because video quality is sharp and crystal clear..
This is my first iPhone. I'm about 3 weeks in. Besides the action button being in the worst place possible, the software feels so half baked.
I agree regarding the ecosystem, oh boy! It will hunt you down!

I just bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max back in 2021 and I don't even know how I ended up in 2023 owning the latest iPhone, Watch, MacBook Pro, iPad Air, AirPods Pro 2 and Apple Pencil.... 🥲🙃😪 Apple really does know how to attract customers!
Mark, I wish you would stop speaking about Apple products are so expensive, when android devices are just the same expensive items or in some cases even more expensive. Why would anyone wanna leave the Apple ego system for a mixed up scattered android system? Frank
What most reviewers fail to say a lot of the time is that with iPhone it actually works fluently, my Samsung watch 5 pro was shit and sluggish and had some lag to it and connectivity problems here and there. Now I got the 15 pro max with Apple Watch Ultra 2 and it’s so much better. Again best thing about iPhone, no surprises it just works.
Was that a sim tray I saw on the 15 pro max the one where u can eject a SIM card from one phone to place in another
Only thing with this phone is that is not android. If you can't afford it don't buy it very simple
I bought the iPhone 15 Pro Max (coming from a 13 Pro) because it’s the first time they implemented titanium, USB C, and I wanted to try a Max-sized phone. 

The part about having the urge to buy an Apple polishing cloth though 😂 GUILTY! Btw, it’s not even that great..it doesn’t smoothly wipe screens and it leaves a lot of lint. I use an Oakley eye/sun glass cloth after wiping my iPhone screen down with an eyeglass lens wipe. 

Your videos are great, Mark! Keep up the good work and keep the insights coming!
Sweet iPhone 55🎉
iPhone doesn’t have pause button in video recording😡
Enjoy the subtle British humor. 😂
2 iphone 15 pro max 1 TB.
I love everything Apple except the iphone. I absolutely hate this phone even though I’ve switched in 2019 and have tried really hard to like it. The iPhone 15 pro max is not impressive to me and those things you’ve mentioned in the video are exactly right. Practically useless. The only reason I’m staying with the iphone is the watch, which unfortunately Samsung has not matched yet, or else I’d switch to a Galaxy S3 Ultra.
While I don't necessarily disagree with you, my problem with the Android ecosystem is how totally fragmented it is across all of the phones. Not to mention that the only way to get pure Android is to buy one or two specific phones. Then there is the question of how much do you trust Google. 

I went from an iPhone 12 Pro Max to an iPhone 15 pro Max and I'm very happy with it. I also upgrade from the watch 5 to the 9.  Cell phones in general are very mature and new features and improvements are often not that big of a deal anymore. 

My 2 cents...Keep up the great work Mark. I get a lot out of hearing your perspective on tech.
Atleast this apple man is honest👍👍👍👍
Im marked safe from apple😊😊
Hi, Can you pls give some information about heating issue ?
I disagree 
I have a 15 pro max 
Series 8 45 mm
And AirPods Pro 2 

Don’t need a Mac book don’t need a watch ultra
I have never used iphones and im not an apple person but this is the most complete iphone they ever made imo.
I felt that iPhone 13 Mini face 😢
Coming from android, I jumped in to the apple ecosystem with both feet. I got the 15 pro max, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and a MacBook. Doubt I’ll ever go back to android. I love it.
The iOS software is un-matched ? Okkk!! Another one bites the dust... /done..
Hi Mark.
I'm looking at up grading to iPhone 15 pro soon.
Just curious why you chose to buy the larger Pro Max option, over the smaller Pro model?
Thanks all for such a comprehensive clip towards the “Apple People”, u r all right!!👌 Appreciated but it wont change the fact that I am still wont leave the Apple ecosystem, not because I cant get out, but other products still not convince me enough to change (even sometimes i really want to try). Remember the time of Ericksson, Motorola and specially the legendary invincible Blackberry that nobody could guess they would beatable by the real Rookie - Iphone. Dont blame on Apple, blame on all other products like Samsung, Sony or else not trying enough, are they??🤔
Seems to me the majority of the comments can be applied to any phone maker, especially Samsung and Google who are creating their own ecosystems with tablets and watches etc. They’re all too expensive. They all are too big. They all push to get you to be in their ecosystem. When Apple tried a small phone, nobody bought it, so they had to kill it. Companies go where the demand is. For myself, I have virtually every Apple product and Samsung product (phone/tablet/watch/earbuds/monitor/TV).
This is so so true regarding the addiction that comes with the Apple eco system
I hate clickbait. Guess its back to mkbhd
I'm happily ensconced in the Apple ecosystem. That being said, I don't feel any particular need to upgrade from my iPhone 14 pro max. It works perfectly well and probably will for at least another year or two.
Loved this video because of how real and relevant it seemed. You didn’t go on about specs for 10 minutes, you talked genuine concerns that the average consumer might have. 

As for the action button, I suggest playing around with shortcuts. Mine used to just be silent switch, but now I’ve got it set to open a folder with several options from jotting down a note to opening the Google Assistant (sorry Siri, I only trust you with setting timers).
Thank you so much for speaking the truth ❤
This video was made strictly because content needs to be made.  Stop making content for the sake of making content and just make good content. This was so unnecessary. “ the counter argument”. So stupid lol. You’re not the only one but your on the culprits
PS. I am proudly a long-time iSheep.
“Portable telephone?” Does anyone actually use the device as a phone anymore…?
You say you’re an apple person but you just made the action button do the same thing as the volume button below it 😂 Johnny Ives goes and they added more buttons
I just bought my first iphone ever yesterday iphone se 3rd gen. Just bc Apple has the small phones market cornered with the se. Because it don't cost an arm and leg. Small phones shouldn't cost flagship prices
Love your videos, Mark, but I have to disagree with you on the Apple ecosystem sucking in the unwary newbie. Granted I know your comments are tongue-n-cheek on this but as an Apple FB going back to my first Mac in 1990, I have yet to get completely sucked in. I have yet to purchase an Apple Watch (loathe the square face), and no Homepod (or any other assistant will grace my home, I cherish my privacy too much) , my 15 in MacBook Pro is of 2015 vintage, no Apple TV. I do have an iPhone 13 Mini, 2 iPad Pros ( 2022 12.9 specked out, and a 2019 11in iPad Pro) a Mac Studio M2 1Tb and that's pretty much it.
Hi Mark, Totally unrelated but what headphones are you mainly using right now?
I agree. The way they use their game strategy to make you cough out more money for their products. It’s ridiculous and a joke to say the least. Thanks to the consumers who gladly give them their money and don’t complain about their “FCK UPS” thats why they keep getting away with their strategy on getting over on us. As Brian Tong would say. That’s a bad 🍎
Love my iPhone 13 Mini !
So much tongue in cheek - brilliant
Paying £1200 ish for the very best the segment has to offer , means your phone is every bit as good as a billionaires phone …..I bet you can’t say that about your car , house , tv , holiday etc ….
You are right about the ecosystem! It all started for me when Apple launched the M1 Macs. I bought, and stiil use my M1 Mac Mini. 
Three years later, I now have an 11" Space Gray M1 iPad Pro, Deep Purple 14 Pro Max, USB-C AirPods Pro 2, and my latest purchase is a Refurbished Abyss Blue 45mm Watch 7 GPS.
from an xs max (2018) to an iphone 15 pro max last Wednesday. every 5 years I think is the best time to upgrade. I just like the 15 pro max better than the 14 pro max.
You lost me with the display section.
Highly entertaining and informative at a normal human level. Proper person relaying real world info and very welcome for that
"Later this year" is somewhat of a diminishing target.  In any case, why have a "phone of the year" when so little has been done to improve the phones(in general).  As far as I'm concerned, it's just a phone.  I don't spend massive amounts of money on one.  I keep the one I do buy for years(still rocking the 12 mini). I don't obsess over the quality of my photos and/or videos.  It's just a phone.  If a person goes wacky over a notch, that person has a problem best dealt with in deep therapy.  I'm "embedded" in both the Apple ecosystem and, apparently, the liberal use of quotes and commas.  I want things I can't afford and can't justify for purchasing.  Just as I was when I used a PC.  I'm a gadget person, but there are limits to my insanity.  It's just a phone.
No problem with apple Buy.... I don't buy it. 😂
[Lady Bracknell voice] "A MObile telePHONE??!!" It's a sophisticated pocket computer that works in ways our feeble brains can't understand. And it costs less than £2,000! Humph! 😤😀
People are pawns for good marketing these days. That's why Apple can get away with what they do.
Man, that ecosystem point described me perfectly; aside from the Apple Watch Ultra and MacBook Pro (I went for an SE Apple Watch and the M2 MacBook Air), Apple has gotten me to go in on every single one of those items (including the polishing cloth). It's the tech equivalent of "if you give a mouse a cookie"... But I don't regret it; I love my Apple tech and I'll keep on buying them as long as they keep on making them.
I couldn't agree more mate my entire life I was a Android user but for the last few weeks I became a iPhone user now I have bought iPhone 15 Pro max Airpods 2 pro and watch in space of few weeks Apple completely take over me.Cor blimey.
"Basically you have to be an apple person" 😂😂😂😂😂
Personally, I think that your view on the Dynamic Island and the Action Button is a bit unfair, or at least just a matter of perspective. For example, I actually use the Dynamic Island quite a bit on my 14 Pro Max, it's quite convenient when having multiple apps on. Could I live without it? Absolutely, but that doesn't mean it's not useful for those of us who don't really give a toss about the size of the camera cutout 🤷‍♀️😂
As to the Action Button, it sounds to me like your use or lack thereof is a matter of muscle memory rather than it not being convenient. Correct me if I'm wrong though, I haven't used 15 Pro/Pro Max so I can't speak from experience.
"And I thought we lived in a world where all phones were big". Oh my. My iPhone 12 mini really stands out here. ☺️
Best camera with a marketed tele lens that crops to less than half a megapixel...? Or do the lenses, and the "crop lenses" differ from the other 15 models?
I would say the standard I phone 15 is a brilliant phone. Getting over 2 days out a single charge. Great value for money phone.
I enjoy listening to you talk about issues that don't bother me 😆
Not using h1 pro anymore?
My phone is only 47 a month… so it’s actually not bad
That is when you have to be stronger and don't let the system suck you in.... I still have the 12 series and still as good as yours right now. Probably will keep it until IOS goes bunkers and I can't update any longer.... Yes, I have a computer, iPad and watch but no subscription what so ever.... Not one! 😇🫶 Oh Yes, Apple TV to watch Amazon and some others. 
PS: I don't watch Apple TV. Not in tune with my believes in my life.....
I’ve always been impressed with the Sony Experia from a distance whenever I’ve seen someone with one.. looking over the persons shoulder
 whilst rocking an iPhone 😂
pixel phones only quality is the camera. that's it nothing else. my action button is set to silent. hey Mark how many view do you get with posting and android phone compare to an iPhone?
I have the 8pro but the finger scanner is very bad
I loved the rant about the ecosystem.  Boy, can I relate!
The rant on the Apple ecosystem felt personal or maybe I’m projecting. 😂
iPhone 12 mini FTW. Bought new on release, just paid £85 for a new battery from Apple and should see me good for another year or two. Used to chase the latest and greatest releases. No more when I genuinely have a phone that works very well, does what I need it to do at a very good level and is small enough to carry without it looking like I have a roof slate in my pocket.
My Phone of 2023 is the Honor Magic 5 Pro
Yeah, Mark you nailed it. However, as former Samsung/Sony fanboy, I have more trust in Apple making ever little feature such as Dynamic Island, Action button useful in a few iPhone/iOS development cycles. And for the rest I think iPhone 15 Pro Max is combination of little things that simply work, for instance FaceID is so underrated despite being a key feature for my daily activity! I use FaceID like 30 times per day withou even noticing. And I still waiting Google to implement a reliable FaceID alternative in Pixel/Android.

So things like FaceID, Dynamic Island, Action button, USB-C etc are winning combination for me, because it saves my time and effort, so I can be more productive and procrastinate more ))) This is why I pay more for Apple products.
I like my Pixel 6a more than my 13 Mini. From the standpoint of privacy and the ability to personalise it, the Pixel is better. I like using the Pixel without Google Android; I prefer using the GrapheneOS on my machine. I like the videos the 13 Mini makes. The stills taken on both of these phones can be edited in post to look more like each other's photos. They complement each other in my lifestyle.
The price of the device is not a negative. Anything in life is priced so that some people can buy somethings and others cannot (in the capitalist society that yes - spans all of Europe as well). 
iPhone15 Pro Max is nearing a point, though, that whether buying this or other new Apple iPhone makes sense since the new features are negligible.
What comes to the Apple ecosystem as a whole (which I have fully from computers to phones, pads, tv etc. etc.) it is obvious that Apple is pricing themselves out from so many people it doesn't make much sense anymore. 
I think if Apple does not make a course correction with their pricing, they will be in for a rude awakening and soon. After almost 20 years of being in Apple ecosystem I'm very close to shatter the whole thing and make a new system for myself and leaving only perhaps my iPhone and MacBook and ditching everything else. This is not an iPhone problem - this is imo an Apple problem.
Welded to Apple eci system lol,  never had any sails push adverts directly to me ever,  my 2014 MacBook Pro still works flawlessly that’s 9 yrs old,  if you dint like the 15 pro max and want Apple but the smaller phone , you decided to buy it,  personally I love the bigger screen to view my photos and videos and watching Utube on and it fits in my work trousers just fine,  yes I have M2 and iPhone 15 pro max,  it’s my choice and I’m happy with it,  if you don’t like don’t buy it and pick another brand and be happy with it. As you said, Samsung smart phone is more expensive now,  you only live once so enjoy it and like I said,  if you don’t like it then simply don’t buy it 😎🤓🤓
First (I hate that I did this)

M3 Mac Mini 2024 Release Date and Price - 200% FASTER!!


Snapdragon Elite with 16GB of ram looks very interesting. Will be interesting if we get a dev kit with that chip in it.
Iphone 15 Pro Max 🖤
I have M1 Mac mini.  I am ready to upgrade to M3 Mac mini when released.
I'm planning on upgrading my Mac Studio M1 Ultra to the M3 Ultra this summer when it releases.
I’m looking at getting the new MAC PRO tower in 2024, will it have a M3 pro chipset?  Thanks
Have to wait for the spring of 2024 to get my M3 mac mini 😔
I am planning to buy a Mac Mini M2 16gb 1Tb, I may not be able to wait 7-8 months for the M3
MacBook air with M3
I am considering the Mac mini M3pro
Great work! Looking forward to black Mac Studio with 128G RAM.
I have a PC setup for video editing but I do plan on getting a mac mini to use Logic Pro for their awesome percussion sounds and synthesizers, but using Ableton for the actual sound mixing as that is my favorite DAW and most familiar with the built in effects :))
Need to buy either Mac Mini or Studio.  Can wait for latest model.  Should I get M2 or M3?
In early 2024, I plan to get a 6th generation iPad Pro with wifi and cellular capabilities and a 1TB+ drive.
Hope the price stays down so we can get one . Want to get an iPhone 13 mini this year.. best channel ever
Thank you for the info. I plan to buy a 14” MBP M3 Pro. But this mini looks nice!
Hello from Greece! For the coming new year I am thinking of buying a Mac Mini m2. But it seems better to wait a little longer...😉
Wonder when Apple going to show some new innovation, and woo us with some new exciting, and groundbreaking computer. I can almost see the M4 lineup in the same laptops range, the same mini and studio plus the half hearted tower configuration.  Even the 13mbp was just replaced with a watered down 14 macbook chassis.

Expandable pci slots would be nice, as some users may want to add a 8tb nvme I understand why phones aren't expandable but there no reason why apple computers cant offer better upgradability. Or are upgrading your computer as regular as your phone, ok if your rich.
Looking forward to getting an M3 Mac Studio or Mini in 2024, depending on how the prices end up.
If I could I'd love to buy an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and some kind of MacBook, other than the iPhone 15PM (hoping I win the giveaway), wish me luck!
Mac Mini - Maybe an M3
I will buy a Macbook pro m3pro !!
iPad 9th, iPad 10th, MBA 13 m1
Im still dreaming to have an apple device or an iPhone 15 pro max 🤔 in the end of the year or next year hope im the lucky one😁✌️ its big help for me to create a very good content like yours 😅
I would love to buy the air pods pro 2 (usb-c) in the new year🎄
Need a new Imac
I hope to buy the new SE in 2024 (if it comes out ) because i have the SE 3 and it is a disappointment but at least it works! Keep up the good work!!
iPhone Pro Max will probably be my next purchase in 2024 after that it depends on what suits my needs in 2024.
Mac mini👍🏽
Would like to buy a Mac Mini pro next year.
2024 Mac mini M3
hey,  Im looking to get a new mac mini m3 when it is released next year.   Hopefully it's all its cracked up to be.
I’ll probably buy an M3 Mac Studio next year if they release one
Mini M3 with 16GB is on the wish list for 2024. Doing Photo editing on my M1 and could need some more processing power.
The slowest M3 Pro only has 1 more P core than the basic M3 and 2 of the total cores are now only E cores so the M2 Pro not only has 1 more P core on the 10 core vs the 11 core M3, but the 12 core M2 actually has 2 more P cores because the M3 Pro has 6 E cores and 6 P cores.  I’ve seen Logic benchmarks that show a huge improvement between the base M2 and M3, but lower performance on the 11 core M3 Pro vs the 10 core M2 Pro because 6 performance cores make a big difference.

M2: 80
M3: 116
M2 Pro (6P 4E): 153
M3 Pro (5P 6E): 143

The only way an M3 Pro could be worth it over the M2 Pro is if they cost less.  £1199 for the binned 11 core M3 Pro for example.
🌬️So excited the new lineup of Apple products! 🤗Hopefully we have NEW designs! 😊 Apple gang we READY!!!
Waiting how the iMac line is getting before any purchase.
11/27/23 It's great to hear the the Imac mini  will see a 2024 release with the M3 or M3 pro chips, seem like a price increase of $100 for the base model, I been holding off on upgrade since 2011 from my 21" iMac and 2011 iMac mini which has served me well, I wish that the 24" iMac came with 16GB of memory instead of the 8GB, then for me making the choice harder on what I would purchase. Thanks for the notice video on the iMac mini M3 spec and timing, need the uprade without having to go with a MS Windows (never ready for prime time OS) with it constant Online updates.
Great Video!!! Can't wait for the Mac Mini M3 Pro in the Year of the Dragon!!!
Looking at Mac mini to replace my 8 year old iMac 27 for my photography
I’d love to get the MacBook SE! If not, M3 MacBook Air
Thanks, Matt! Great stuff! Looking at purchasing Apple Vision device in ‘24
If I could get a minicomputer in April, I'd be happy because I'd have the money ready, but I wouldn't get a laptop because I think repairs would be too expensive unless the motherboard assembly is broken, and if the keyboard or screen is damaged, it can be replaced with a new part at a very affordable price.
Always great videos and put together so well. 🎉🎉🎉🎉 iPhone 15 pro max giveaway entry🎉🎉
I am going to buy a desktop Mac as I work in one place most of the time. Choosing between M2 Max Studio, M2 Pro Mac mini and the their m3 versions. I plan to buy it in February or in March. So it would be great if the m3 chips came at the time. if not, I will most probably go with a M2 Pro Mac mini as it is not that big of a difference with M3 Pro. So if M3 Pro comes a few months after my purchase it will not be that disappointing.
I am planning to get M3 Max Mac Studio next year for my home video editing.
Aw c'mon, you are just making this stuff up   :)
Wonder what would be best budget monitor for m3 mini
Definitely want to buy a Mac Mini but still debating on regular or Pro. And now with the release of the M3 I might just have to wait longer 😅
Now I'm torrn between 3 computers now ..a spec'd mini ..Imac ..or another macbook ..all M3 ..big love to you and the show.
I will be getting an M3 pro mini
I like your video and would like to buy a M3 Pro Mac MIni, I like my M1 mac mini  but would be ready to go the next step.
I'm keen for an upgraded Macbook Pro Max M3 chipset to give me more grunt for my editing. After watching this video, I'd be keen to upgrade my Mac Mini as well!
Looking to buy an iMac 3 2023 for basic photo editing, but also looking at the Mac studio. Watching to help me decide.
Apple Watch Ultra 2
I'm still on an i7 Mini but I must say.  I'm looking at the M3 Pro mini when it drops.  If my money agrees with me at the time. HAHA!
I have the Mac mini M2 Pro, so I‘ll not buy the M3 Mini, but I plan to buy an iPad Pro with the M3 chip in 2024!
My first 2024 tech purchase will likely be a pair of full-sized HomePods for our living room. I’d love to buy an M3 Mac Studio this time next year, but that would require a substantial career upgrade. I’m working on it, but there are no promises in life.

I’d pair it with the 6K Dell display, if possible.
Holding on till the M3 Pro Mac Mini is released!
I got an M1 Mac mini at launch. I will probably get the M3 later in 2024 as a main machine. But Some really needs to kick up the base memory to 16 gigs. It's embarrassing at 8gig
I am a musician who doesn't have much space on his desk and was really thinking of a Mac Mini M2pro. I need a powerful device at good price; but I am happy to wait now that I've seen this video for 😜 the M3 pro Mac mini. I think it's going to be amazing!!
i can't help but wonder if it would not be more cost effective for apple to simply create a single high performance processor with all the trimmings, than a multiplicity of combinations of ram / gpu / storage options.  you would only need a single die design.
I’m planning to upgrade my old iMac to an M3 iMac in March of 2024. If the M3 Mini is available by then, and I can have a bigger screen at a lower total cost than the iMac, that’ll be a consideration. I’m now preparing for a new Youtube series to be launched at that time and could really use the speed and power of the M3 for video editing over the ancient 2.7 Ghz Intel Core i5 that is in front of me as I type.
After watching your video, I might wait to buy a Mac Mini. I was thinking of buying a Mac Mini M2Pro, but I might now wait for the M3Pro. 🤔Thanks for putting out this video. 🙏👍
i cant wait for this mac because my Pc is super slow and only gets 21 fps in fortnite with low grafics so im gonna but this
I’m going to buy the new iPad 14 inch, I can’t wait! 😍
Time for a recording studio update from a 2014 iMac to a Macbook Mini Pro. Also looking to replace my cracked screen iphone 7+.
Possibly lose some expendable cash on a studio display or another MacBook Air for my other room :)
okay, another great video. Looking forward to this M3 Mac mini which I shall buy. Unfortunately the cost with the Mac studio screen will be too much so I will probably buy a 30 inch Dell screen paired with the M3 iMac mini with the magic keyboard and mouse.
I have been on the fence about getting a MAC studio, but the mini has always been on my mind for the cost. Great video!
Great
Thanks to you, I've now set my heart on an M3 Mac Mini in 2024
Thanks 16 iPhone pro max
Any idea when the M3 Mac Studio will be released? I need a new Computer for Music
an macmini m2pro…
If I had a choice, I'd love to get a 13inch MBA M2 in silver. My old laptop was a 2013 15inch Macbook Pro and it recently got broken. I think the new MBA is the best in terms of price, performance, and portability. By the way, love this new video on the Mac Mini 2024! Keep the news coming!
I am planning on buying a mini. I have been waiting to see if it would be upgraded with the M 3 chip. Thank you for this video.
I would love to buy new gear, last Friday I was told I loose my job as of New Year’s Day. So winning this iPhone would make it still a happy new year 😅
Mackbook  sc or mac mini i think syme prize and speciation  so we see in 2024.
I'm looking forward to the release of mac mini m3
I'm trying to decide between new M3 Pro or discounted M2 Pro, after the new one comes out
Ill be looking at M3 mini for music production....might end up with M2 depending on cost ;-)
I would love to get a mac mini in 2024.
If I could get the new m3 Mac mini before August then that would be *✨PERFECT✨* as I’m saving up for an m2 Mac mini to start taking college courses online next fall already.
I haven’t had a computer in almost 6 years & my last computer was a 2013 MacBook Pro.
I recently purchased the new iMac M3, still waiting for it to be delivered.
wish I could afford
I would buy Mac Mini 2024 M3
I would buy a macbook air in 2024
Can't wait for the Mac Studio M3 Max Ultra, that thing will be a beast
I am just waiting for m3 mac mini..
I’ve already bought a new case for the 15 pro max that I’m going to win😂😂😂 I plan on buying a new M3 pro laptop this year
To complete my MacBook/iPhone setup, I consider to buy an iPad in 2024 !
Apple 15 pro max is powerful , the thing is I don’t have money to buy , my cp is Apple 12 wish is old & slow , I like Apple 15 like what you describe , I wish I’m the lucky one to have Apple 15pro
Unless the existing design of the Apple Mac mini hampers the performance when installing a new M series processor, why change it.  Do not change the design of the Apple Mac mini just for change sake.  After all, this is not women's fashion.
I would buy a macbook air in 2024.
Im excited to get an M3 Mac mini ... and maybe a new iPhone if you don't decide to give me that one. ;)
I am thinking of building a new gaming PC in 2024, but if I could get a Mac Mini m3 that had comparable performance and price I would probably get one. Having everything in the Apple ecosystem would be great. We will see what Apple can do in this next edition of the Mac Mini.
Great video bro
I'm expecting to buy some retro Apple gear. An old trashcan mac pro and an older Apple display, for my bedroom setup.
MacMini may be what I will buy.
M3 mini is incredible since you can portably use it and this is nice that you can comportably hold them. Well t's me again my plan for IphoneSe2 is completely locked and never look for other apple devices these Christmas ❤️❤️
I am very interested in the Apple glasses, but more recently I plan to update with a new iPad and upgrade my Apple watch to Apple Watch 9. I currently have an iPhone 14 Pro Max, I need to finish paying for that before upgrading to 15. My biggest desire is the Apple Glasses w/ prescription lenses.
I am really excited for the next line of macs! i hope they change something related to design
I just upgraded my MBA M1 to a base MacBook Pro M3 Pro 14 inch and I love it. I am still using my 13 Pro Max, so winning a 15 Pro Max would be ideal!
Surface Pro with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite will be the piece of tech I'm most excited for next year!
"what had..."   should be "Which had..."
👍👍👍👏💪💪💪
certainly any M3 chipset powered Apple devices can do! hope to get my hands on 15 pro max T T
Matt is there any difference on getting the m2 mac mini or the macbook pro m2 or m3 for a person who does content creation like you tube and does much processing of videos and photos or both can handle the task well.
Mac mini look good 😊
Sure wish I could afford a 15 Pro Max! If I could I would definitely do it.
100% faster. not 200%.
8k
Great video! Next year is going to be so fun! The quicker Apple goes M3 as standard, the better. M3 raytracing puts the Mac products back into usability for modern gaming. That's a lot of new customers, which is great for Apple developers!
Matt you’re doing great! I would love a new Mac mini but first I’m waiting for the new iPad Pro. Maybe get the mini later in 2024.
I love your videos and Mac Studios
Mac Studio!
Are you waiting to get your hands on next Generation Mac Mini M3/M3 Pro?
Are you waiting to get your hands on next Generation Mac Mini M3/M3 Pro?



I Ditched Windows for the M3 Pro MacBook Pro. Was It Worth It?


You can change the fn key to be the cmd key. You can actually setup all the bottom left keys as you want.
this is the exact video I was looking for, doing the same jump..havent seen a video showing the difference between being pluged in/not vs a mbp on battery..excited for my 14" m3 pro purchase
CAn you upgrade u Mac without losing u insurance: NOPE   Dell send the engineer to my house to fix any problem I have in 2 days time LOL That is a PLUS    All the Apple components are weld to the main frame.  I got the basicc Alienware r17 w2 and then upgrade the ram and SSd, can you do that witha Mac? NOPE tHEY ARE GREAT BUT WITH A PRICE   Get the laptop that fit to your needs, that is the key thing here.
LOL which one is better?  That is a false assumption to start.   I have an Alien 17 r and it is great, especially the service: the engineer comes to my house to fix any issue I have LOL Does Apple offer such a thing?    NOPE  sO EVERY LAPTOP HAS IT OWN WAY TO BE GREAT, AS LONG IT DOES THE JOB U WANT TO GET FROM IT.
Windows users are brainwashed.
Also, you likely won't need more than 18gb - I'm also a power user, and 16gb has never been limited.
Congrats! Welcome to the bright side. 10yr android/PC guy who made the switch last year. Pretty disappointed in myself for not making the switch earlier. Definitely snag Arc as your browser - GAMECHANGER. Also check out Raycast as a spotlight replacement, Rectangle Pro for windows management, and SmoothScroll for more natural scrolling on that MX3. Lots of other cool applications as well. Ask away!
The loose hinge is the defect with your laptop.
Moom for windows snapping, Bartender 5 to get more space in your task bar, settings for showing or not your disks on desktop.
Use your thumb to press cmd-c / cmd-v so that your fingers stay in the home row, either same hand or opposite hand, there are two command keys after all, imo much more ergonomic than windows ctrl pinky. I can fluently use both OSes and I much prefer Mac's keyboard layout.
Fabulous video! I did the same as you - switched over to the M3 two weeks ago, as I have an iPhone and iPad and absolutely love the Airdrop feature. So far, so good. I like a lot of the Mac features, especially keyboard shortcuts which I feel are better than Windows, along the loading of external devices which is smoother and quicker on the Macbook. On the downside, I’m not enthused by the MacBook music app, or the photo app - I’m hoping that with time I’ll come to enjoy them, but for now, for my uses, the Windows system is better in this regard. However. The speakers on the MacBook are terrific, as is the keyboard. I’m glad to have switched, but wouldn’t say the MacBook is better than Windows. They’re just different and it all depends on the user and their requirements. In 2023 both systems are great!
The things on desktop are like temporary containers. You can just eject them when you are done installing. There are also plenties of shortcuts or settings that Apple hidden from you. It might not be super easy to search. I would suggest AI chatbots from OpenAI, Claude or Google when you try to do more deep customization with the OS, some settings might require terminal commands and chatbots will be quite useful then. Also, videos from Snazzy Labs on Mac tips and apps might be useful.
I use chrome
you DO NOT need a MAX! Save your money!
So true, i went back and forth but always settled on Apple... 32 is a must never lower
Look in the settings for minimizing apps into their icon. Right now I think they are minimizing to the dock by the trash can. Other section of extra icons were recently used apps.
eject the desktop icons.  its like a USB drive.  They mount on the desktop.  After you install what you need form it.  Just right click and eject.  
excellent purchase.  I expect it will keep you happy for many years.
You can also remove the recent apps and recent documents in your dock, one of the things I disabled as well cause it feels like clutter
Cmd + v and cmd + C are typically used with the thumb for cmd and your index finger for V or C.
I have the same Zephyrus RTX 2060 laptop. It is painfully bad when not plugged in as I believe the ram speed for example goes to nothing.
Bro that Alienware PC Gaming monitor is insane
Is the 18gb of ram being enough?
Great video. You have a beautiful home and family. I use a 2019 4K iMac that I got an amazing deal on brand new ($700 CAD) and an iPhone SE (2022).
It feels like one of these 2 things is true: 1. you're not very experienced w/ computers or 2. you're purposefully strawmanning things about Windows 👀
is that a 14 inch or 16 inch?
Turn on stage manager.
🦌
Good video!
I just made the switch too, mostly because my Razor Blade RTX 2070 laptop battery swelled up and I can only use it plugged in anymore, and my workplace Lenovo is a chunk...
if you click on finder on the top left on Mac, then go on setting and you untick harddrives and the other options the icon on the screen should go
You are using the Mac keyboard layout wrong. Hear me out ;) most commands are found on your left side of the keyboard. Så try to place your hand so far to the left, that you will have to place your thumb on Command and use your index finger for copy/paste keys "C" and "V". Most of your option key functions, such as @ are place to your right and so why not try to place the thumb of your "right hand " on the "option" key as your little finger press "@". You will very quickly discover how much easier it is to access option functions, like @ compare the "shift + 2".
I bought the M1 mac when it came out...lifelong Windows and Google user (also 40 years old lol) because of the rave reviews of apple silicon. Now I have an iPhone, because they sync together so well for texting from the laptop and sharing notes, air drop files etc. Then came the apple watch...because it was seamless to use with the iPhone. And had to get apple TV so I can mirror easily to the big screen 🤦‍♂️ Of course then I had to get air pods pro for similar connectivity issues...Apple sure knows how to open the pocket book. I highly recommend learning Mac shortcut keys..there are hundreds. Also look into hot corners.. Very handy. Nice video and welcome to the apple orchard! 😂
Hey amazing content i just got a  question since u r an editor...i ordered the same one u got since i edit alot on premiere pro...i have all my footage or an external harddisk...my footage is usually around 400-700GB and mostly 4k...i used to proxy my footage to be able to work smoother...u recommend me to do so on this one since so many people say i need 32RAM for 4k...or is 18 enough for me to work without proxies
Edit:and does it handle multi camera nests well since my last windows made it hell for me to edit on like 5 camera multicam window
Get the Max Version you love it,  you can put in low power mode if you want more battery life and its still faster then m2 max on high power
The first AAA game comes out on December 20th, leaked performance numbers show the Macbook Pro Max is the same as an Alienware M18 64G (i9 13900HX RTX 4080).  On battery.  The correct software really matters for gaming.
Welcome to the dark side of the force. This is how it begins. greetings from Germany
Currently shopping around for my first MacBook Pro. Lifelong windows/android/google user. I still plan do keep my Windows PCs and Android phones, but there's no denying that MacBooks are the best option for creators working on a laptop.
Great video. I love how you committed to using only Apple products at first. That way you’ll know whether you prefer Chrome to Safari and not miss the hidden gems you find whenever you buy new tech. I’m not shocked you were surprised at how good the MacBooks are, it would be difficult to find positive Apple reviews if you live in the Windows laptop/PC world, where offending a company can cost reviewers 10k’s of dollars in units or sponsors. The main reason reviewers present such lukewarm and negative focused Apple reviews is there is absolutely no financial upside to positive Apple reviews. Apple does not pay for reviews, they don’t even give out free review units! They LOAN you an early unit, you have to return it. Access is everything in the review world. Apple isn’t perfect but it’s definitely not as bad as reviewers have you believe.
Dude Sick, I've ordered it tooo. Can we Download and play Ov2 on this Machine .?
I enjoyed your video.  I made the transition to the Apple line a few years ago after being a Windows user since the mid-90s.  I started the transition mostly out of curiosity, to try something new, and got hooked on how seamlessly everything works together, so now I have an Apple desktop, laptop, tablet and phone.  Full disclosure: I still have a modest Windows gaming PC that I built so that I could continue to play the games in my Steam library, and to use some of my old Windows applications that I still need.
Love this 'real world use' style review! Not alot of Windows-to-Mac reviews for the M3 Pro Macbooks.

I spent alot of time overthinking the marginal losses/gains of the M3 line vs M1/M2, but I forget how stable Mac can be with professional programs. I think it's a substiantial upgrade whichever chip I end up getting my hands on.
Interested to see if you stick with it. 

I still have a windows PC I use for some things but I’m finding I’m turning it on less and less. Nothing beats a Mac laptop for everything bar serious gaming and some niche use cases.

Agreed re the sliding bottom. Someone’s gonna come out with a smock little sticky feet fix for sure. 

Oh and I swapped the m3 pro for the base m3 max. The battery drain is a bit more noticeable. But not like crazy bad. I think the trade off is worth it. Really comes down to how many hours you need before you’ll be able to plug for 30 mins or so, as that’s all it really takes to get back to 80%. 

Anyway, I keep an eye out for your next vid to see where you landed.
Great video. Quality of the video was top notch. Not too long or short. I am taking notes. LOL!
Excited for you! I made the switch way back in 2010 and never looked back. Blue screens, lack of driver support, constant updates all contributed.  My company went from iPads to Surface Pros a couple years ago and it was a great reminder of why I prefer Apple's OS's. Fortunately my company is all web based so the Surface Pro is in a box in the closet and I just continued to use my iPad Pro 12.9. Getting the 14" MBP M3 Pro to replace the iPad for work.  The M3 Max is insane!  For my needs, I just can't justify it. Went with the 11/14 W/32GB Ram and a 1 TB SSD custom build. Cheers!
As a fellow PC guy, I have no problem admitting the MacBook Pros are the best for video/photo editing and for DJs.  The only few PC laptops that come close for video editing are the Asus ZenBook Pro 14x with a Nvidia GPU and the Dell XPS 17 9730 with Nvidia RTX 4080.
I was a lifelong windows user until switching to Mac about 10 years ago.  Windows 8 did it for me. Windows is hot garbage… irritating ads, bing search, and tons of bloat.  Not to mention hiding every control behind layers of idiot-oriented dialogs.

If you are planning to buy iPhone go for pro max 
So you will get pro experience across
1:45 im so confused.. he listed rtx 2060 under m3????????????
My PC-to-Mac switch is almost complete, and my MacBook M3 Max 16-inch with 128GB / 4TB storage is on its way to my nearest DHL service point! Hoping for a smooth transition. 💻🍎 Exciting Times !
I changed from windows to Apple in 2015, after attending a photographic workshop, I had a £3k MSI windows laptop and the guy sat next to me had a £1k macbook air, I could not believe the difference in smoothness and ease of use compared to my high power windows laptop, after this I borrowed a macbook for a week, it was a complete game changer.  Today I run an M1 Max 32GB 1TB MacbookPro 16" for my mobile work and an M2 Ultra 64GB 2TB Mac Studio with two macstudio monitors for my desktop set up.  The Apple Silcon update is the biggest improvement in modern computing in the past 10 years, a cool quiet experence and the battery lasts all day on my MacBookPro.  The M2 Ultra renders 1 hour 4k videos in less 8-10 mins aand offers no frame rate user experience, nd it never goes over 45deg C, in fact I can render a 4k video and continue woring on Lightroom and Photoshop while running youtube for music in the background and not even notice.  I note that when reviewers compare windows and Apple machines, they generally use benchmarks, but as I always ask every windows user who insists windows is better, have you actually used an Apple machine, because for me it is all about the experience and the quaility, plus as you say 'it just works' no more fussing with drivers, directx, .dll files etc etc.  Welcome to the light 😀
I just made the switch also
Although I didn't like macbooks, but I do always say if you really need a laptop and you have the budget, then go with the Mac 
But only if you have the budget 
Apple care is a MUST because that laptop isn't upgradable nor repairable, so just keep that in mind, and yeah
Have fun 👍
There’s no battery downside for m3 max, not really, just enable low power mode when u need extra juice. Max with low power mode will probably be nearly as fast as pro.
What a great video man! I'm just about to take the same leap of faith. Your video helped me a lot. It was so relatable since I also make videos and play HS 😊😅
The crazy thing is, as an apple user from 2007, it no longer "just works" when compared to the Jobs era OSX. Back then it really did just work and would never crash. Perhaps an app got stuck once or twice a year and that was it. Compared to macs from that era, the current macs feel like broken window's machines to me. From about Mountain Lion onwards, OSX has been getting, less reliable and more buggy with each new version. However, the last time I used windows (windows 10 pro) when I bought a new HP spectre,  I ended up smashing the machine with my fist and bent the case over my knee after about 6 months or so. So I guess windows is still worse. lol we live in the dark ages of computing. 2000~2015 ish was the best before things got dark.
Hi,,, good choice mate,,,,I did the same but back in 2021,,,my first mac was the M1pro 16ram 1tb SSD, was & still is a brilliant machine but I made a mistake not bumping up the ram to 32gb,,,I'm working in Photoshop and illustrator 10h a day, pretty big files with tons of layers, so need more ram,,, actually what I did, sold my m1pro and bought a M1max with 64gb ram and 4tb ssd for £2400 brand new,,,,a lot of people would say that it was a bad move and I should upgrade to the new M3 family but to be honest, M1pro\max is plenty for what I need it for, just need more ram,,,,and of course the price,,the new one is £3600 in the UK (,,,I have sold my M1pro for 1700,,added another 700 to it and now I have 2x the gpu, 4x the ram 4x the SSD,,,,M1max still a rocket,,,,And I was \still is a window guy for 20years, have a wear os watch, Android phone, but if it comes to laptops, I prefer macbooks
RIP there goes another windows user take care buddy this is where we depart......
For a first laptop I'm getting a binned m3 max tomorrow. Hope it delivers hahaha! Worked in IT for a while, building PCs for a decade now, gonna be strange to make the switch but I need a laptop that can hold its battery and do my basic 3d models on Blender and Fusion 360.
u r clueless. it sucks. cant play Path of exile
I have been a lifelong Windows OS user, and I like their file system. 
I started using Macbooks from 2017, and up until 2021 they felt the same because of the heavy fan noise due to intel processors in my software engineering computer programming workflows.
This all changed with the M1, M2, M3 processors and now my default attraction point and no-brainer choice is to get Macbooks. It handles all workflows so well.
I wish Apple does the same efforts on the iOS software and make it more practical, that can change my choices as I also want to own an iPhone. Currently it is all secured by high-end Android phones, the only winning spot for iPhones are their video captures.
You won't regret the move. My oldest working Apple device is an '09 MacBook Pro. Although she doesn't have horsepower to do much, it's still a solid machine. Regarding the keyboard layout, eventually you'll develop muscle memory to use both formats without even thinking about it. I swivel between personal (Apple) and work (PC) all day long haven't noticed in a very long time. (Apple keyboard is more pleasing to the fingertips than this Thinkpad...). I laughed at the sliding around piece - very true. Enjoy!
I liked this video 👍👍👍
there are a lot of things i like with mac over PC. build quality especially but i think my favorite remains having imessage completely insync/available from both the mac and the iphone
Dood!!! So nice! Those render times are going to be minimal now 👍
I'm so excited for you!
Once you go Apple u won’t go back. U just get used to heaven
I always use stock app whenever possible it gives so much better experience than google and windows apps.
8:08 That icon is a Disk Image.  It's like a 'container' for the application.  You need to drag the app from this container into your applications folder.  Then you can 'eject' the empty Disk Image & run the app without it.



Mac Studio M3 ULTRA Release Date and Price – NEW SPACE BLACK!


Are you EXCITED for what the M3 ULTRA will bring us in the Mac Studio?
Great info!  Looking forward to the M3 Ultra.  It's great that Apple is upgrading already given their previous slow Pro upgrades.
Yes! Excited!. I'm planning to buy the studio M3 around march next year.  Thanks for the informative video.
Mac Studio and might not wait for the M3 version..
Hi, congratulations on your work, I'm writing to you from Italy, the country of Pizza! I already own a Mac Studio M1 Max and by the end of the year I would like to sell this and get the new M2 Max or wait and get the M3 Max directly!! Good work!!
Comptition entry: In 2024, I plan on getting Mac Studio with M3 ultra chip, if it is released. I've been saving money for a new computer and I cannot wait.
Same price. I like that!
in the next year I hope to make enough money to buy myself all of the apple products, Mac included, wish me luck!
Should I wait for this or Go with current M2 Max Chip? My Boss Budget is very less 😅than
I am planing to buy either Mac studio M2 ultra or rtx 4090 system. But I'm short on budget. 😢
prendere un server non so se Mac o pc ci sto pensando!
Hi Matt - am living in Malaysia and really have enjoyed your channel videos. I plan to wait for the M3 ultra , but I think I’ll have to eat noodles for a year to be able to afford this beast. I have just started with learning video production and 8 want to be able to future proof myself with tech for the next few years at the very least. 

Thanks again and have a great lead up to Xmas and the holiday period .
I can’t wait to get my Mac shudio.
I want to participate in the draw and I intend to buy a mac studio pro max in December or January 24.
iMac未来是否有比24英寸或更大的尺寸出现？
5:03 well I just wanted to say the equipment that I’m going to be purchasing in the future will be the black magic 8 k pro series camera and to use with my da Vinci resolve. I’m going to get a MacBook studio but I’m not sure which model to get at this time. I’m going to have to wait until the M3 Chip comes out.
M3 Max Studio with a lot of ram and base ssd is what I’ll probably by next year.
I'd be interested in an M3 Mac mIni pro!
OK I legit JUST upgraded from an M1 mini to an M2 studio........
🤣
I hope Apple grows up and starts charging fair prices for memory and SSD. No Mac with less than 512 Gb for starters, even entry level.
Waiting for a new Studio Display with HDR and 120Hz refresh.  Ready to buy now
Amazing!! 😍😍
imac display xdr 2024
I plan to switch to a MacBook Air 15 inch  with a M3 processor
That a nice teck...

Would love to have it, may be some time in future...if all thing go well..
I am Excited For The iPhone 16 Pro MAX to see what Apple will have in store! I love the anticipation just like Christmas 🎄
macbook air  refurbed
I'll choose the Mac Studio M2 ULTRA!
Imac or Mac Studio in 2024
hahaha ..it's like this ..every new computer that comes out ..I'm like i want ..i have held out for the power of 3 ..while i'm trying to win an M3 laptop currently ..the ultimate 3 is M3 Ultra ..i can't wait to hear the specs ....and black is my thing...big love  to you and the show.
Even though I have a new M2 Mac Studio, I am missing my pcie slots, so I really would like a Mac Pro, which, of course, come with those slots....
Hi Matt, thank you for your you tube videos, very informative. I am currently saving for a new Mac in 2024 and the Mac Studio looks perfect. I would love an Iphone as well.
I've beeeeeen dying to get the Mac Studio Ultra, since the M1 chip was released. Believe it or not, there hasn't been stock in Thailand since the M1, I wonder if the M3 will be a pipe dream for us.  It would be an absolute GLORY to get that iPhone 15 🤩😭😁
I want to buy the M2 mac mini. Great video!!
Will be looking at the new Mac mini if it's released in 2024. 😊
I want an Apple Watch ultra 2
My iPad Pro is 4+ years old…time to replace it.  I’ll pass it on to someone who can use it😊
👃
I am going to get the maxed out version of the mac studio and choose space black
Glad to hear the contest for iPhone 15 Max is international
Would most probably get a new Mac Studio when it comes out.
Mac Studio space black will be in my shopping list.
I could wish for a dedicated displayport on the newer Macs. I know you can hook one up using one of the thunderbolts but just to make things simpler, please
I wanted to buy a new windows laptop this year, but with all the noise about ARM chips and upcoming ARM CPUs for windows, I am not sure if I should buy one now or wait…
I’ve been looking at getting a Mac Studio, and it will likely be my next purchase.  Space Black would be a great addition.  From all the comments I’ve seen with respect to the M3 chipset, it doesn’t seem like that has been such a great upgrade.  Same with the iPhone 15 Pro set of upgrades.
Hi Matt. I looking forward to buying an iPad Air (5th Gen) to go along with my iPhone 15 Pro Max that I win from this video :)
M3 ultra 256GB, 16TB?
I don’t give a rip about the color option(s). I do care about the base performance and price. I’ve been itching to move on from my 2017 5K iMac for some time now. I was hoping the M3 would launch early in the year, but if Matt is correct in projecting that Apple will focus in the iPad in early ‘24, I’ll have to hang tight until summer. On the other hand, perhaps 20 percent performance gain won’t mean much for me, given that nearly all my work is in Photoshop and LR. Argh.
I need to upgrade to the Mac Studio M2 can't wait until M3
i think the mac pro should have its own cpu that has higher core count like a threadripper pro 96 core are even a 64 core something new.
I’m interested in getting an iPad Pro and a Mac Studio, but I’d prefer to wait for the M3 update versions since those sets of processors were revealed sooner than usual.
I've been thinking about upgrading to the Studio, will probably hold out for the M3 now. Yes I know it's not necessarily going to land until next year, but is' a relatively big investment. Want to be sure I buy something that should last for a few years.
If I had to get a device next year it would probably be the M3 MacBook pro. So I start getting ready a little early 😂😂😂
If anything I will get the m1 version the price should go down
I am looking to upgrade my iPhone 5 SE this coming Boxing Day. I would happily take a free phone if I win the draw.
MAC Studio.  Makes no sense to me to upgrade from my M1 Pro 16" Macbook.  Performance is hobbled by heat factors in that form factor.  M3 Mini or Studio is needed for SIGNIFICANT performance improvements over what I'm already enjoying.
I am looking forward to the new iPad wit the landscape camera
I'm looking to get the studio M3 ultra. I'm trying to future proof, but I know it will come with a cost 😮
I would love the Iphone 15, havent had a new phone since the iphone 6
Hello Matt, I won't be buying any gear this year.
I looking to get a new Mac Mini or Mac Studio.  My current iMac is starting to show its age.  Thanks for the video.
"everything we know", yeah right, b/c Apple telegraph upgrade details and have done for decades.
Are there cookies inside?
Space Black Mac Studio looks much better, would be nice if it comes in space grey or gun metal option
Actually I hope to win this giveaway,
I really appreciate your great efforts helping us with this content 

I would like to use the m3 version
Hello!
I'm thinking of buying an Apple Pencil 2 for my iPad Air 5.
I think you made a typo, should not it be 10-24 performance cores not 10-26? (2 M3 Max with 12 performance cores each.)
Thanks for the video!
M3 Studio (maxed out) for sure.
Wanna get a m2 macbook air but not sure if it’s enough for mid-level music production
I've beeeeeen dying to get the Mac Studio Ultra, since the M1 chip was released. Believe it or not, there hasn't been stock in South Africa since the M1, I wonder if the M3 will be a pipe dream for us.  It would be an absolute GLORY to get that iPhone 15 🤩😭😁
I picked up a good deal on an M1 Max Mac Studio not that long ago. I will use that for audio production for the next few years at least. Maybe wait for the M4 or M5 before upgrading. I might get a new audio interface in 2024.
Thank you for the update Matt! I am looking to get a Mac mini for my work, I am still debating if I should get M2 or M2 pro as M2 chip only comes with 24G memory (max). I think we really need a more budget-friendly  studio display for Mac mini users.
Thanks Matt. Just purchased an iPhone 15 Pro but having a Max wouldn't be bad at all.
I will buy one with 192Gb Ram and 8TB SSD.
I wait since a few years to replace my IMac 27... So, I wait for the M3 Mac Studio with a Studio display (a new one I hope).
I’d love 4 TB with 64 ram - can I please borrow some money?!? 😢
I want to get an M3  MacBook  Pro probably early next year if not during Christmas time
I’m most likely going to pick up an Apple Watch next, and an iPad Pro once they do a refresh. I already have an iPhone 15 Pro Max, but my wife is still on an SE 2, so winning a 15 Pro Max for her would definitely make her happy. She’s totally jealous of the camera in mine!
I'm excited about the new iPads. I've been waiting to buy one, but I'll definitely get the M3 version as soon as it's out.
I plan on purchasing a Mac Studio of some kind next year.
I'm all in for a Mac Studio M3 to replace mt Mac Studio M1
I'm personally  holding on to my iPhone 14 Pro, iWatch Ultra and my M1 Max Mac Studio at this point.
In 2024 I want to buy the M3 max macbook pro 16 inch, because I still have an intel mac. Then I want to buy the new mac studio m3 max like in this video because working with a macbook and a pc is not the best combination 😔
I’m looking to upgrade my iPad 5 to a new model and I REALLY need a new desktop too; I hope they do release the Studio in space black or at least space grey.
Hello Matt. I have been watching you and hope to buy an iMac M3 begin 2024.  But mayday it is going to be an Mac Studio. Greeitngs from Holland.
I hope to buy a Mac Studio M2 Pro or a MacBook M3 Pro, for music production but now.... watching your video, I might wait a bit longer.
im exited to see space black color in the new m3 mac studio it looks amazing (:
Hi Matt, great vid as always, looking at getting a mac mini M2 pro when I visit the states for xmas, would love a new iphone as mine is dying....
I got work laptop as MBA M2 and thinking of buying M3 pro for development and also planning to make gaming PC build by late of 2024 year.
For 2024 I am thinking Ultra M3 to replace my mini pro i7 and iPad Pro M3 to replace my M1
I am saving for a macbook pro with the m3 pro great device, will be my first macbook pro
looking to buy one of the new macbooks
I’m looking to purchase an M3 iMac.
I plan on getting a Mac Studio to replace my M1 mini in 2024. So, looks like I'll be holding out for the M3.
I'm ready to order 3 pcs of the ULTRA for my agency. But I would love to see more info about it. I will need them for animation, video and offline productions.....  and maybe I woulf love to run some trainsim on one of them. I love trainsim games.
I’m going to replace my old MacBook Pro 2013 with new MacBook Pro M3 pro. Still saving money so most likely in early 2024. It’s going to be huge moment for me. I’m so excited
Anxious to get more info on upcoming Studio Macs.  Been an Apple fan for decades!
Exciting
I would like to get a new TCL TV for my PlayStation 5.
I'm really looking forward to the black Mac Studio and hope to pull this one off as you said. I will probably consider buying one to use when the time comes.
I would love to buy a new Apple TV 4k for christmas 😍
I have the Studio M2 Max arriving on Monday ... ugh
I am student from the Netherlands and I started photographing beside my study. I am looking for a good computer to edit my photos on. For my 8 gb Macbook Air  editing the amount of photos i am working at is a bit too much. So i am starting to save money for the Mac mini or Mac studio. I also would love to participate in the give-away, because i am not able to buy a new phone as well 🥹🙏
MacBook Pro 16" and probably the Apple Display.
let's be honest, it's not clear why even upgrade from the M1 Ultra to the M2 Ultra. The speed is so high that it is enough and will last for a long time. And neither you nor I know when the M3 will be released and how powerful it will be
i plan to get a mac studio in 1-2 years
Fab video, my next tech purchase is going to be a toss up between a Mac Studio or M3 Max MacBook Pro..... still debating!
Why should the new Mac Studio become a different Colour, than the Studio Display? It simply doesn't make any Sense.
i'd prefer the iPad to have the option to run MacOS rather than iOS.
if we're getting a space black mac studio I want a space black studio display, magic mouse, and magic keyboard to go with it
Maybe instead of using 'What' you could use the word 'Which'
Still hoping for a bigger imac (pro; studio)
2024 iphone 15 pro max
Does every Apple influencer sound like Tim Cook now?
im excited for the new studio display space black color ❤ will prolly get that once its been launched
Can't wait to upgrade to the m3 mac studio next year. Currently still using the mac mini with the m1 chip. 😊
Really looking forward to it
Really enjoy the videos! Plan on getting the new AirPods
I’m planning on buying the M3 Max Mac Studio next year, along with a MacBook Air 13inch M3 and the next iPad Air. Developer/designer here 😊
Apple Mac Studio!
Could have… could have… could be added…. WTF are u talking about??😀😀 Speculations… ridiculous..
I would rlly appreciate to be the winner of giveaway as I am in need of a new phone especially a new camera as my phones isn’t the greatest and has gotten a bit slow
I am truly looking forward to Apple raising the price to unbelievable heights and a performance compromised base model.
If I had a choice, I'd love to get a 13inch MBA M2 in silver. My old laptop was a 2013 15inch Macbook Pro and it recently got broken. I think the new MBA is the best in terms of price, performance, and portability. By the way, love this new video on the Mac Studio! Keep the news coming!
Wow, winning an iPhone would be a dream come true for me! I've been saving up to join the Apple community, and this giveaway could make that dream a reality. The anticipation is overwhelming, and I can already imagine the joy of unboxing this incredible device. Thank you for the opportunity, and good luck to everyone participating! 🎉
Oh I really want to buy the space black it looks incredible.
Adding a M3 Max Mac Studio when announced in 2024
Planning on buying a Mac Studio M3 Ultra.
I am thinking of buying it in future for the music studio purposes.
I am coming from an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I am planning to get an iPhone 15 Plus or iPhone 15 Pro Max. #AppleGear
I really enjoy this content, I’m looking at a m2 air or waiting for the next iPad Pro.
Looking for both the MAC Studio M3 MAX and the M3 iPad Pro when they drop!!!
If they could make the M3 Ultra GPU the same performance of RTX 4080 it will be an instant win, but I highly doubt it, still a long way to go for Apple.
I’d like to upgrade to the Mac Studio M3, with display and a new iPad 12.9”. I’d love that iPhone you’re giving away!
Gianni❤
i'm looking for a deal on a mac studio max m2!
M3 Mac Studio in 2024!
M4 Ultra Mac studio will be stunning in titanium black.
Currently have a Studio M1 Ultra, plan on a M3 Ultra when it come out. I WANT the space black! Are you listening Apple?
Can't wait to get one!
I’m getting a m2 Mac mini pro for myself and an Apple series 9 watch for my stepdaughter when there’s free vouchers for purchases for Black Friday (which will help towards paying for Logic Pro for my Mac mini)

If the phone was added to the list it would make what I’m paying out less painfull 😂 (please accept my entry to the comp) 🙂
A black mac studio? I am SOLD! Silver is not really my cup of tea, but I still love my mac studio max basemodel. It is crushing it! But I do live in the limit of what it is capable of. Not sure if it is the ram or the fairly low harddrive that limits it. A few restarts, but otherwise, it is eating up pretty much all I throw at it. I am on a lookout for a second hand apple monitor to go with it. Or maybe there will be an upgrade with a better camera in it? And if they start selling black or dark grey again.. Better start saving up. Theese tools are expensive 👀 
I must say, the day I went from an imac having tine to drink cooffe whole I waited for it to work.. and the day I started working on the mac studio.. Like night and day! I did not even have time to blink before it did its tasks! Life changed for sure and I think I have gotten a bit spoiled 😄👌🏻
What 32' brand screen ideal for MS M3 Ultra?
I am planning to buy three new Mac with the M3 for the office to edit videos. I also going to upgrade my iPhone to from 13 pro to 15 pro to record Pr res videos using an external SSD.
The new mac studio in matt black with M3  chip. Lost faith in windows.
greeting's, I'm eyeing that Macbook pro in Black M3. looking good!!
I've got to laugh at how so many people are focused on the case colour of Apple products. Like, what difference does that make??? Duh.
these are going to sell great!. I can't wait to upgrade M1 Mac Studio. I will be ordering as soon as it is available.
The space black option looks nice and the specs for the m3 chips are impressive, I've been thinking abt switching from a old Samsung to an IPhone 13 for Christmas but I won't miss the chance to win an iPhone 15 Pro max
i'm planning to get Mac studio m2 pro soon, would be great if i could win the iphone too :)
Competition entry: I am planning on getting the new Mac Mini with M3 or possibly the M3 Ultra you mentioned in this video. As for other prroducts, I am looking to get a wifi kettle that actually monitors the qty of liquid inside it. Most do not do this and you always need to check if the fricken kettle is full enough. Wyze also has some nice products and I may be upgrading to their latest cameras, but possibly ones without a light build in as those only attract insects and give false positive warnings for "people detected" when it's nothing but an insect. :)
im going to be getting the m3 ultra hopefully.  im planning on starting a business next year so its going to be a big investment for me.
I’m excited for what kind of performance upgrades the m3 ultra will have for using open source local large language models, also I hope the memory bandwidth doesn’t get cut like it was with the m3 pro and max
Bring out the m3 studio so i can get the used m1 studio for cheaper!!
As far as blacks go, I much prefer Samsung's Phantom Black. Still, Space Black isn't that bad.
What kind of advantages do the Mac Studio has on the MacBook Pro?
Hoping for an Apple  Watch Ultra for Christmas, and based on this great video I'm planning on waiting for the Mac Studio M3 Ultra til after WWDC. Either buy when something is brand new, or buy the previous version right after it has been replaced. Right? 😀
I just brought MacBook Pro in the future will definitely look to explore what advantages the M3 Ultra has to offer. Wow I would love to have the IPhone you are offering as I have an iPad and MacBook and the only thing is missing is an IPhone Please god let me win this give away 🙏🏻
I was considering replacing my M1 iMac with an M3 iMac but now that I've watched your video, I might consider the Mac Studio. An Apple display would not be in the budget. Maybe a Samsung, Dell, or Benq display. Thanks for the video. It made me look at the Mac Studio as a contender.
I would like to buy a new M3 Ultra in the Mac Studio, hope I have enough budget on it!!!!
Might get close the RTX 4090 level for 3D but doubt it…
I was considering buying the iPhone 15 Pro Max blue titanium 512 gb but bought a PlayStation 5 slim with cod 3 and a 4 tb solid state drive stick. I chose the PS 5 because my iPhone 13 PM still works great. I was kind of curious how the Dynamic Island worked but figured my iPhone was good enough and should last another 3-4 years. I do kind of wonder how the usb c 3.0 works on file transfer with the iPhone 15 pro and pro max.
A new Mac Studio without Thunderbolt 5 would be terribly underwhelming...
Matt - I was apllning on buying the M2 Ultra Mac Studio but thik I might wait until WWDC 24 for the space black version with the m3 Ultra!
I may buy an M3 Ultra Mac Studio in 2024 with 256GB Ram, and 8TB of SSD. for 4K video editing, audio post production, and complex music production.
I would buy that just for colour if that rumour is true
HI Matt, thank you for your you tube videos, very informative. I am currently saving for a new Mac in 2024 and your Mac Studio preview had me impressed and swayed my decision to buy one because I am learning to play piano, a lifetime dream and the studio presses my buttons.... I'm getting excited already
I would choose the maxed out version, but the tradeoff is being not a stock configuration could take a month before shipment, depending on your area. Well worth the wait though, especially with the enormous file sizes from high-end cameras like Canon R5 C.
It would be nice to have the M3 Mac Studio! As developer I'd be more than happy having a beast of a CPU like this one!
I think I'm going for a 14 M3 MAX 14/30
I want a Papaya color Mac Studio M3 Ultra!
Useful update, thanks Matt.  I bought the Mac Studio M2 Max recently, so hoping that'll stay current for a few months yet :) Next purchase and updated MacBook Pro... will probably go with an M3 for that!
M3 Ultra Should have excellent capabilities. M3 Max is already in one of the tops by CPU and ultra will be insane, maybe Almost doubling its Multicore Capabilities. Also looking Forward to its GPU capabilities.
Yes WWDC would be the best place to drop the new M3 series Mac Studio and Mac Pro.  Now what I would like to see in a Mac Pro is dual SOC processors.  FreeBSD 3.0-RELEASE announced on 16 October 1998.  With the final release, 3.5-RELEASE on 24 June 2000.  FreeBSD 3.0 was the first branch able to support symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems.  

So, in technology years multi processing under the UNIX kernal at the heart of macOS has been around a very, very long time.
Still waiting for a “pro” iMac with 27 inches and m3 max.
Funny how a small black cube would be the next step for Apple. Really the colours underneath glowing in the thumbnail should be red, yellow, green and pink.
I want to buy a Mac Studio with the Ultra chip. The thing that makes me hesitant is because I feel like tech in the next year or two is about to make a better breakthrough with its chips and this Studio will be outdated.

It is like when Apple pushed for Intel and people to buy it, then all of a sudden they released a chip (M1) and just dumped on the people who just bought Intel stuff.
I’m not sure is this like a computer modem? I just recently started using Apple phone and iPad 10 generation and love how all my stuff is on both devices not like my work hp computer and laptop
I was going to buy a new Iphone 15 before the end of the year but sense I'm going to win the Iphone you have I'll wait. LOL, I'll then take that money and buy a
new ipad pro. Cheers
The prices are way too expensive still 😂
I still have a iPhone 12 Pro and seriously need to upgrade to IPhone 15 in 2024
I am going to buy the 16" M3 Max MacBook Pro and sell my M1 Max just because I love the black colour and also my work will benefit from the additional neural cores.
This is what I’m most likely buying
I don't see the Mac Studio coming in Space Black unless the Studio Display and/or Pro Display XDR also get Space Black
I want an M3 ultra mac pro
I want an iPhone
I was thinking of buying a M2 MacBook Air next year.
really would want a M3 ultra but the price is to high for my bank book :(
Yes got a friend who’s soo eager for the M3 ULTRA, what features and what upgrades will be done on it ,.. and am planning on getting an iPhone 13 mini this year .. great channel
Planning on getting a MacBook Pro 🙌
So glad to hear about Mac Studio ‘24! 
I just started with a Max M2 and would love to be able to upgrade to an M3 Ultra (hoping pricing does not shut me out).
Kerp MacStudio M3 2024 updates coming!😊
I prefer silver 🤭
reluctantly a M2 Studio Max with 64GB 4TB, and Studio Display… would prefer 27-32 iMac!
I heard that the mac studio will get only the binned version of the m3 ultra so 28 cpu cores and 60 gpu cores( besides the m3 max binned and unbinned versions) whereas the mac pro will get the option of both the binned and unbind m3 ultra to sell more mac pro's for people that want the absolute best. I am using a blender a lot I hope that the M3 ultra will get double or close to double the raytracing performance as the m3 max is already quite close to the performance of a 4090 so if it were it would be insanely fast
I wish Apple makes Mac Studio M3 ULTRA with 2 HDMI 2.1 ports so that one HDMI port for connecting to 4K 120Hz TV and the 2nd port for connecting to 8K 60Hz TV for my multitasking AV editings and visuals.
I’m looking forward to the new iPad pro
Same guts, different wrap. 
And way too much. Unless Santa is feeling generous.
if the mac studio m3 gets to be a beast more then the mac pro... what would that means for the mac pro? i thing even for the most wild workflows it would be kind of overkill... anyways for the next year im eyes lie on the new ipads
but m2 studio just release at june ?
I am an App developer and my hardware is sooo old. So I will be getting a refurbished Mac Studio M1 from Apple Refurbished store, in 1 week! I am so excited. And this M3 news is great, because if my App does well and this leak turns out on point, I would be in a good position to trade in my refurbished M1 for a Space Black M3! I will also probably get a new iPhone next year, as my current one I test my apps on is getting rather old. I love, Love LOVE your videos! I find them super interesting and very helpful technically as an app developer.
What do you think the best monitor is the the max studio in a 32 inch besides a Apple monitor?
The Mac Studio looks nice,  but i personaly i'm planning to buy a Macbook pro m3 Pro for portability.
As I have a Mac Studio M1 (with 128GB RAM), I'm not willing to update it, but for a 'powerful' 15" MacBook Air M3 I might consider buying one
I'm really keen on getting an iMac mini in the next year.
iPad Pro ultra
Next month I was thinking about getting a Mac studio but seeing your comments, I'd better wait until this new version with M3 Max and that black color that looks great... I'll keep holding on with my Mac mini 2012.
M3 Ultra’s possible release date is WWDC2024! Can’t wait to see a space black Mac Studio!
I am going to the Mac Studio M2 Max 2022, I'd wait for the M3 version, but I need it asap. So, let's see when I will get the money to buy it (hopefully this year).
looking at Apple Watch and apple home pod
Still hoping for a new 12inch MacBook 🤞🤞🤞
Would def get it!
I think im going for a new apple silicon Mac, it's been a while since I have my old MacBook Pro with intel base and right now M series chips looks really tempting, I think it is time for a change to feel the power and quality that these processors can give
Apple absolutely HAS TO offer better MONITORS for their stationary Macs.

1. We need a basic less than $1k monitor for Mac Minis. Without all UNNECESSARY junk inside (aka Studio Display).

2. Mini-Led MID-RANGE monitor for ~$2k. Something nice for Mac Studio users.

3. New Pro Display XDR with 120Hz and more dimming zones Mini-Led (or QD OLED).
Everything will depend on how fast TSMC rolls out their new 3nm process. From AnandTech things seem to be on schedule.  Better, faster, more yield.
I wish Apple would give USB-A some love. I'm so fed up of having to buy type-C dongles just to plugin in 99% of devices.
Did you mention the release date in the video ?

Anyway, when do you think Apple will update the Mac Mini lineup to M3/M3 Pro, given that Apple released the M2 Mac Mini in Jan-2023 (delayed from late-2022 due to supply chain issues allegedly), do you think it will come as soon as Jan-2024 with a press statement or in the 2024 spring event some time in March ?
Looking forward in getting the m3 iMac this year.
i just have my savings on a Canon R6 MKII
would like the Mac Studio in space grey.....no questions
Great info on the Studio
I could see myself buying a Space Black Studio, when it comes out.  I like the color.  However….not sure how that would work out with a silver Apple Display (if you already have one).
I wish I could upgrade my late 2012 MacBook Pro 🤞🏼
Mac Studio M2 Ultra ❤
The Mac Studio looks very tempting indeed.....would be nice if they kept an M2 Max in the line up to extend the range. I was thinking of getting a Mac Mini to replace my old iMac, but I'm unsure now - thinking cap on. Thanks for sharing Matt.
will not be out till November 2024 .
Hopefully I win
Space Black isn’t that great, folks. It’s still a fingerprint magnet and I think silver still is the best color to cover up smudges. Anyway, I sent back my M3 Max 16” MacBook Pro (Space Black), because I felt it didn’t really enhance my video editing experience for the price. I’m hoping this updated machine drives the prices down on refurbished older models, like the M1 Ultra Mac Studio. Then, I’ll snap up a heavily equipped M1 Ultra Mac Studio, instead of the latest and greatest.
I hope to buy the new SE in 2024 (if it comes out ) because i have the SE 3 and it is a disappointment but at least it works! Keep up the good work!!
I need to upgrade my iPhone SE as its a bit long in the tooth now and I am missing a larger screen as my previous one was the iPhone 6 Plus!
This is really a beast,
But to buy every apple gadjet i would need to make big friends with a central bank😅 ill wait for the 15 pro max as it will do most of the work i need from it
If basic Studio Max comes at $1999 starting price with 32G of ram and 512G ssd, i am upgrading. Tired of waiting for larger iMac.
Am going to get a Mac mini M3
Great video!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉    GIVEAWAY ENTRY IPHONE 15 PRO MAX🎉🎉🎉🎉 PICK ME🎉🎉🎉
I’m going to wait
if this doesn't do gaming, then no Mac will
I have a new iMac on order in blue
If you have a 120Az screen can you use it with the Mac studio or mimi
11/22/23 I have been holding off on upgrading my 2011 iMac mini, but not sure if it will be a 24" iMac M3 or iMac or iMac studio with M3 chip depending on chip level, a lot will depend on what it will cost. Like Apple but wish you could still upgrade the memory and Harddrive like you could on the Apple iMac ones.
iPad Pro 12.9. Just upgraded my Late 2013 iMac using openCord 1TB 2.5 SSD and 1TB 2280 Size ssd and 32GB Ram.
I would get this if it was in space black or a Mac mini in this finish
Does it have a fan
It defenetly would be nice 😊
Dose it supposed 4k
Awesome 🤩 I wish I could afford any of the iPhone SEC models
Mac studio
I need this.
I might gat a Mac mini with the M3
Yes matt
Hiii
Are you EXCITED for what the M3 ULTRA will bring us in the Mac Studio?

APPLE ha RISOLTO un Enorme Problema.🍎😱


Meno male che hanno risolto non ci dormivo la notte
Se questo è  l’enorme problema boh, onestamente Apple se iniziasse a mettere le batterie intercambiabili come ogni prodotto  Apple 🗿 magari non spendiamo altri schei per comprarne di Nuove
Ma ha solo contro per solo 5€ in meno
Cazzo che affare 95 euro per una penna
Finalmente
😎
Ok ma il fatto è che quando è tutta la usbc su un iPad non ridisegnato da 0 quindi con un design da cavo Lightning
crearti un problema e venderti una soluzione
Creano i problemi e se li risolvono da soli lol, che sono intelligenti 💀☠️
Pure 95 € per una penna 😂 sono malati proprio questi
Puoi fare samsung era meglio prima o dopo? ❤
Ciao Ciao fate dei contenuti perfetti , ma ho un problema, io quando chiamo una persona parlo ma la persona a cui sto chiamando non sente nulla di quello che dico , mi potresti aiutare?❤
Samsung aveva già quasta rivoluzione
95 euro la più economica? Cos
La prendo dallo store on Line e poi a gennaio la restituisco se mi ci trovo male.
Prova a ricaricare da un iPhone a un android con la USB c
Io con la Pencil comprata su Temu, che funziona benissimo e la ricarico con un cavo Usb-C ed è pure magnetica
ma dai, non ha il rilevamento di pressione e poi nella vecchia apple pencil c’era l’adattatore, comunque il problema l’harisolto solo per ipad 10
😂
Tutti i poveracci nei commenti che insultano Apple mi sa sempre morire 😂
Bella, bellammerda!
Ora il mondo è molto migliore😮😮😮.....fatevi prendere per i fondelli ingenui
Mamma mia, ora si che sono convinto, a continuare con android
bhe un fattore positivo di questo dettaglio é che si può utilizzare mentre é in carica o no?
Davvero bella❤❤

Galaxy Tab S9FE , Tab S9FE+ , Ipad 10. Nesil karşılaştırması


Video içeriğini değiştirmiş bir dış güç gibi oldum ama çok teşekkür ederim. Güzel bir karşılaştırma oldu emeğine sağlık. 
DİKKAT -- Bu detaylı bir karşılaştırma yazısıdır !!!

İki cihaz ile ilgili benim incelemem ve yorumum şöyle:
Tasarım >> Her iki cihaz da görünüm olarak güncel bir görünüme sahip olup, kendi ürün gamlarındaki daha üst segment cihazlar ile benzerlik göstermekte. Bu da kalite algısını üst düzeye çıkarıyor. İki cihazı da eline alan bir kişi bu ucuz duruyor demeyecektir. Bu nedenle birbirine karşı hiçbir üstünlükleri yok diyebilirim. Tamamen sizin öznel güzellik algılarınız ile ilgili bir durum.

İşlemci >> Unutmamak gerekiyor ki giriş-orta seviye tabletler, telefonlar kadar güce ihtiyaç duymuyor. iPad 10. nesil, içerisinde iPhone 12 serisinde kullanılan Apple'ın kendi A14 Bionic işlemcisine sahipken; S9FE,  içerisinde A54 5G 'de kullanılan Samsung'un kendi Exynos 1380 işlemcisine sahip. İkisi de gayet yeterli işlemciler olsa da Apple farkını 2-3 sene önceki amiral gemisi işlemcisini giriş seviye tabletine koyarak gösteriyor. Bu fiyat segmentinde daha stabil çalışan bu kadar güçlü bir işlemci yok. Video içerisinde de gördüğümüz gibi antutu benchmark testinde sonuçlara göre Exynos 1380, A14 Bionic'in neredeyse yarısı. Bu nedenle iPad 10. nesil işlemci performasnı olarak S9FE 'nin fersah fersah önünde. Ancak bu  Exynos 1380 yetersiz demek değil bu segment için gayet yeterli ve verimli. Zaten aradaki farkı günlük kullanımda ve not tutarken fark etmenize imkan yok.

Kamera, Hoparlör ve Mikrofon >> Bence yorum yapmaya bile gerek yok. Videonun 23. dakikasını açıp kendiniz görüp duysanız daha iyi olur. Ben tercihimi bu konularda iPad'den yana kullanıyorum.

Ekran >> Samsung her zaman görüntü kalitesi açısından başarılı olmuştur. Bunun sebebi Amoled ekranları kullanmasıydı. Şu an 5 yıldır kullandığım A70 cihazımda Süper Amoled ekran bulunuyor ve açık net bir şekilde renkler harika, siyahlar hala tam siyah. Amoled ekranda cidden Samsung bir numaradır. Ancak burada kıyasladğımız iki ürün içerisinde S9FE'nin ekranı TFT ekran. Karşı olmasam da birkaç telefon ve A serisi ucuz tableti deneyimleyince renklerin soğuk tonlarda olması beni uyuz etti. Bunu kendiniz sıcağa kaydırabiliyorsunuz ama gördüğünüz renkler hiç en doğru renk olmuyor gibi hep bir ton farkı var. Tabii S9FE'yi satın almadan günlük kullanımda deneyim etme imkanım olmadı. Muhtarım bunu cevaplarsa sevinirim. Apple, IPS ekran kullanıyor giriş segmette Renk doğruluğu daha iyi olduğunu söylebilirim. Çözünürlük de yüksek olunca gördüğünüz görüntü gayet kaliteli oluyor. ha ancak OLED ve Mini Led ekranlar candır ama pahalıdır.  İmkanınız varsa bir mağzaya girin iPad Pro 12,inch modeline ve Samsung'un en pahalı amiral gemisi telefonlarına bir bakın.  Onlara alışırsanız IPS ve TFT eh işte dedittiriyor. 

İşletim sistemi ve entegrasyon konusunda diyecek pek bir şeyim yok aslında. Her iki markanın da kendi ürünleri arasında muhteşem bir entegrasyonu var. Androide alışan iPadOs'a, iPadOs'a alışan Android'e alışmakta biraz zorlanabilir. Burada sizi zorlayacak tek durum geçmişte uygulama mağazasına yaptığınız yatırımın geçişte çöp olması. AppStore'da ücretli bir uygulama aldıysanız, Android'de eğer ücretsiz değilse PlayStore'da tekrar almanız gerekecek. Telefon açısında geçmişte WindowsPhone, Android ve Apple kullanmış biri olarak söylüyorum ki her birinin kendine göre avantajları ve dezavantajları var. Burada girersek çıkamayız en iyisi siz kendiniz mağazalarda deneyim edin ve internetten araştırın.

Devamı ve en önemli kısmı aşağıda bu yoruma yanıtta ...
iPad tek atar. İtiraz edecekler hiç etmesin 5 yıl sonra iPad hala mükemmel çalışırken samsung tabletiniz ana ekranda bile kasacak.
Kolay gelsin benim tab a9 plus tabletimde oyunlarda birden fazla parmak basmama gibi bi sorunum var bunu nasıl çözebilirim
Abi s9 fe mi ipad 9. nesil mi ? Çok arada kaldim.
Hocam S9Fe arada bir durduk yere kapanıyor yada açılma ekranında kalıyor samsung galaxy yazısı yazıyor. Acaba bu sorunu yaşayan başka biri var mı
şimdiye kadar gördüğüm en kaliteli, türkçe inceleme.. Helal olsun..
S9 fe kabı bulamıyorumm😢
S9 FE 45 Watt Pd 2 şarjı destekliyor mu?

selamlar
Öğrenciyim . Not alma ,  ekranı bölüp yarısında yt yarısında pdf acıp ders çalışmak vb. Için kullanacak tablet arıyorum. 
Samsung Tab s9 ve s9fe arasında kaldım. S9 a kendimi biraz zorlarsam çıkabilirim. Sizin önerileriniz nelerdir ?
Merhaba ileride Samsung fe plus almayı düşünüyorum ama şu anda klavyeye ihtiyacım var. Logitech ile Samsung trio 500 arasında kaldım sizce hangisini almam daha mantıklı olur ?
Merhaba, tab s9 fe nin şarj süresi ne kadar olmalı bendeki 67w xiomi sarj adaptörü ile ilk sarjda 3 saate yakın bir sürede sarj etti sizce sıkıntı war mıdır?
Not tutma, pdf için honor pad x9’u mu yoksa lenovo tab m10 plus’ı mı tercih etmeliyim. Ya da 7000’e kadar öneriz olur mu?
S7 fe ve s9 fe plus arasindaki islemci ve ram farki icin s9 fe plus almak sizce doğru mu islemcileri hakkinda hangisi daha iyi tam bilmiyorum
Bir ay önce S9 Fe+ aldim fakat geceleri çok şarj yiyor.Normal mi ?
Merhaba 12.sinifim yks ye hazırlanıyorum tableti universitede de kullanmak istiyorum amacim ders calismak not cikarmak pdf ler konu anlatim videolari izlemek gibi sizce samsung galaxy s6 lite mi yoksa samsung galaxy tab s9 fe yi mi tercih etmeliyim ?
S9 fe kılıf alacam hala daha
Güzel video olmuş emeğinize sağlık
huawri matepad airla s9 fe+ karşılaştırması gelmeli bence birçok kişinin kararsız kaldığı bi konu fiyatlar çok yakın hangisi alınmalı
Yenge sana helal olsun fanboylara kapak olsun
Okuma, not alma, ufak tefek işlere yardımcı olsun diye tablet almaya çıktığım yolda bu kanalı keşfettim ve gerçekten çok teşekkür ederim detaylı karşılaştırmalar için.

Şu iki günde hem abone oldum hem bildirimleri açtım. Bu kanalın YouTube'un çorak arazilerinde daha da görünür olmasını diliyorum.
Hdmı ile görüntü aktarmıyor fe . Tab s 9 ultra aktarıyor demişsiniz. Acaba tab s 9 hdmı ile görüntü aktarıyor mu. Teşekkürler
Abi merhaba üniversite öğrencisiyim genellikle pdf okumak ve not tutmak için ipad 9 veya samsung tab s9 fe+ düşünüyorum hangisi daha kullanışlı olur?
S9 fe den yazıyorum tek sorunum ısınma problemi...
S9 fe icin kac watt adaptor gerekli 25 yeter mi
ipad a whatsapp nasıl kuruluyor
Redmi Pad se inceleme yapabilirmisiniz? Kalem destekliyor mu? Ucu sivri olan kalemleri not almak için
Ben s9 fe aldım saldım artık üzerine düşünmeyi
Tab s9 fe kullanıyorum razıyım
Normalde  yerli kanalları izlemem  kalite yerlerde surunur. Masa basında   powerpoint sunumu gibi  eline dahi aleti almadan  urun incelemesi ad altında   içerik uretirler. Bu cesit olanlar  onda dokuzu. 
Sizde bole değil zaman  ve emek harcadınzı belli videoda.  Başarı diliyorum.
Gelelim soruma. Fe  modelinde "seond screen " secenegi var mı. Notification panelinde  olması lazım. Aleti  kablosuz  ikinci ekran yapmaya yarıo windowsta ozellikle.  
Gene aynı model için soriyim kablolu  bağlanmasada  kablosuz "Smart view" (kendisi samsung app) aracılıgıyla  ekran aktarma var mı. Bu ozellik onemli cunku  uretkenlikte  kullanılıo. İhtimal   orta segmentte  bi s9  muadli olmasın die  kısmışlarsa şasırmam.
s9 ultra mı ipad 10.nesil mi alsam karar veremedim 🥺
abi yeni çıkan apple pencil usb yi de kıyaslar mısın bir de ipad 10. nesilim var yeni kalemimi almalıyım yoksa 1. nesili mi
İnsanın açtıkça açasım geliyor :d 😂
Samsung wacom'un teknolojisini kullanıyor,, bazi wacom kalemleri samsung cihazlar ile uyumlu
apple ne yazıkki tablet konusunda samsungun gerisinde samsung bu işi biliyor her parçası ayrı pahalı olan kutuyada koymayan paran yoksa küçük ekran kullanmak zorundasın kardeşim diyen apple almak pek mantıklı gelmedi üstelik bir çok uygulamada ücretli bizim gibi fakir ülkerlerde artık apple lükstür NOKta
Cuma günü ipad 10.nesil almayı düşünüyorum pdf ve sunum ve not almayı düşünüyorum sizce alınabilir mi
S8 ultra tft mi s8ultra mı s9+ mı daha iyi
Cırt ayşe teyze, selamlar 🫡
S9fe + sitelerde bazen çift kamera bazen tek kamera görünüyor arkasında seri olarak farklı modeller mi var yoksa siteler 6gb ve tek kamera modeli mi gondermeye çalışıyor
Bilinen 8gb ram +çift kamera
Hocam ipad pro ile s9 ultrayıdı kouaslasan bir ilk olir TR de seviliyorsun
Fe plus normal tablet boyutundan çok büyük keşke 8gb ram ve bataryası 10bin mah olan fe olsaydı
Ağzınıza sağlık abi , gerçek çok iyi is çıkarmışsınız harikasınız🎉
S9 ultra aldim seni izleyerek abi cihaz fena ❤ umarim daha cok video cekersin bu arada
S9 fe plus kullaniyom aklinda soru olan varsa soyleyin
Yahu şu S9 FE'lerdeki HDMI ile görüntü aktaramama ne kadar saçma iştir arkadaş. PC deneyimi için DeX modu yapıyorsun ama bunu kullanan adamın ilk ihtiyacı olan büyük veya çoklu ekran deneyimine izin vermiyorsun. Hadi Plus bir nebze büyük ama klavye-mouse ile o 11" ekranda hangi PC deneyimi? S9'dan ana özellikleri kırpmışlar ama S7 FE'de de olan şunu niye kaldırırsın ki..
Samsung en fazla 3 hafta sonra kasmaya başlayacak nereden bildiğimi sormayın 😂
Üniversitenin verdiği edu uzantılı öğrenci mailleriyle microsoft office 365'i ücretsiz kullanabilirsiniz. Çoğu öğrenci bunu bilmediğinden acı çekiyor.
Ipad alirsam test kitaplarini samsungtaki gibi kolay bir sekilde pdf halini indirebilir miyim
S9 fe serisinde hdr desteği var mı? S7 fe de yazmıyordu özelliklerde ama vardı.
Kimsenin çekmediği ama herkesin kafasında soru işareti olan nokta atışı videolar çekiyorsunuz. Gerçekten farkınız belli, umarım daha geniş kitlelere de kendini duyurursunuz.
iPad 10 biraz aşırı pahalı geldi gözüme, iPad 9 10.000 liralık fiyat etiketiyle hâlâ budget şampiyonu gözümde. S9FE+ en özellik zengini seçenek diye düşünüyorum, öğrenci indirimi ile 15.000₺ değil 12.000₺. üstüne takas ile o da takasla ne verdiğinize göre 10.000 seviyesine, hatta altına iniveriyor.

Klavye ve kalem dahil tam set istiyorsanız Samsung Smart Bluetooth Keyboard 500 + 3. parti bir standlı kılıf en ucuz seçenek. Apple tarafında orijinal aksesuarlar dehşet pahalı.

Tabii ben bu fiyat seviyesinde üretkenlik bekleyen psikopat arkadaşlardan biri olarak böyleyim. Multitasking değil de not alma, internette gezinme, bir şeyler izleme amacında olanlar için bu üç tablet de yeterince iyi.

Bu video harika bir karşılaştırma videosu. Emeğinize sağlık. Bu arada ben S7 FE'mi satma kararı aldım, onu ucuza birisine bırakırsam hem alacak kişi hem de laptop arayışında olan ben mutlu oluruz
Merhabalar s9FE kullanıcısıyım öğretmen olduğum için projeksiyon veya akıllı tahta üzerinden ekran yansıtmak için mirascreen cihazı aldım fakat yansıttıktan belli süre sonra tablette “Smart view bağlantısı sabit değil yeniden bağlanmak görüntü kalitesini arttırabilir “ şeklinde uyarı çıkıyor ve görüntü donuyor nasıl çözüm bulabilirim
Abi matepad 11.5 ile s9 fe kıyaslayabilir misin?
Hocam tab s9 fe serisi TFT değil IPS panel
🎉🎉🎉❤👏
Abi seni izlemek çok keyifli 🎉 acaba sonraki videoda s9 serisi ile s9fe serisini kiyaslayabilir misin
Harika bir içerik olmuş. Ellerine sağlık Emre abi
Bluetooth kulaklık bu tabletlere bağlanabiliyor mu?
Merhaba iyi günler ben yurt dışı Vergilendirmemis 8 bin TL'ye kacak iPad 10. Nesil 256 gb almayı düşünüyorum ama  iPad'lerde bazen ana kart yanma sorunu oluyor ve Apple bu cihazları değiştiriyor eğer kaçak cihaz getirirsem Degistiremem cihaz elimde kalir anakartı yanarsa iPadlerde ne sıklıkla anakart yanma soeunu ile  karşılaşılıyor bir bilginiz var mı bu riski almaya değer mi
Bu tabletlerin (örnek s9 fe plus) klavyeli kılıf bağlantı noktası var peki normal bluetooth ile bağlanan bir klavye takılmıyor mu? O baglanti noktasinin ekstra ozelligi nedir??
Sen nasil bir kralsin ya
Abi Allah'ını seversen öğrenciyim KYK kredimi basicam Tab S9 FE Plus VS Huawei matepad 11.5 (ek olarak orjinalinden farkli yan sanayi bir tane kalem alicagim) karşılaştırma yaparmisin ? Su indirimler geçmeden çünkü aralarında 5 bin tl ye yakın fark var ve ikiside yetenekli tabletler öğrenciler için
Ben de yılbaşı zamlarından önce alabilecegim bir tablet arayışındayım ve arada kaldigim tabletler de bunlardi. Özellikle not alma ve video izlemek icin kullanacağım tableti. S9fe hem fiyati sebebiyle hem de apple ekosisteminde herhangi bir aletimin olmamasi sebebiyle daha yakin geliyor ama ekran çözünürlüğü ve büyüklüğü konusunda tereddütteyim. Magazada 10. Nesille s9fe /+ 'ı karsilastirma sansim oldu ve 10. Nesil daha iyi geldi gözüme. Ayni zamanda s9fe tasimak acisindan daha kolay olsa da ayni anda video izleyip not cikartirken kullanmakta ekran büyüklüğü ne kadar etkiliyor?
Pubg cok oynamayan biri olarak konusuyorm 45 fps lik tel im 60 fps oldu guncelemeden sonra muhtemelen bi sogrqki guncelemede samsung tablet ler de 60 fps alir ama pubg ile zaman kaybetmeyin!
36.24 beni üzdü ama bence koruma camını takınca içine göçme azalacaktır
1.) 19:38 hocam Trio 500'ümüz yoksa kaydırmamıza gerek yok, win+w bastığımız zaman dex moda geçiyor. Win+* tuşlarına basınca bütün komutları görebiliyoruz.

2.) S pen ucu almak için servisi bir kere aradım, bir kere de yazılı iletişime geçtim. İkisinde de anlamadılar beni. Kod gönderdiler, tableti servise gönderin dediler; hatta kullandığınız şarj aletini ve kablosunu da göndermeniz lazım dediler :D. Uç alacağım sadece, tableti neden istiyorsun? Ucu en son Amazondan sipariş ettim, yurt dışından geliyor. Umarım kaliteli çıkacak. Uç kırma konusuna gelirsek ben P580 model tabletimde ucunu bir kere kırdım. Servis kaydı oluşturmuştum. Ama sonrasında ucu kırmam ve gövdesinin içinde kalmasına rağmen çıkartmayı başardım. Servise göndermeme gerek kalmadı, eğer siz gönderirseniz ne yaptıklarını bilmiyorum. Onu da başkası denesin :)
Bence ekrana kalemle yazı yazarken dokundugumuzda ekrana islememesi güzel bisey resim fln çizerken elin değerse diye
@nükleermuhtar selamlar üniversite için ipad pro mu samsung galaxy tab s9 ultrayı mi önerirsiniz
Su an hepsiburadada 9100 tlye s9fe aldim vergi indirimi de olursa inanilmaz ucuz olacak
note için Samsung çizim için apple ama sağlamlık dersek Samsung s pen sınıfta kalıyor
ipad'de keynote uygulaması yok mu? çünkü macbook'ta var ve ücretsiz sunum hazırlanabiliyor o şekilde. word alternatifi pages ve excel alternatifi numbers uygulamaları da var mac'te.
İpad 10 nesil almıstım 3 aylıktı orjinal folio kılıfı ve 1 nesil kalemi 12400 aldım çünkü telde 14 prmx dosya aktarımı gayet rahay oluyor öneririm :)
Aradığım video
IPad online nasıl kullanılır mı hala abi
S9 fe+ aldım sorusu olan varsa buyursun
Abi ben senin kadar kaliteli bir kanal görmedim❤



DAY 4 of the Mystery iPad Claw Machine!


Am i the only one who thought dat was a real kid in the beginning🤣😭
Hey I like to know other side if ducks are still there.
I got $100 that says there’s no A’s in the entire mess of cups
Never to much pp
“We have too many PP” with the sudden cutoff was the funniest thing I’ve seen all day 😂
YOUR BACK
Why did you copy arcade warrior with this?
That I pad is only worth like $250
What happened to the lucky duck?? You were so close
We need a more pp ☠️
U print a letter A in printer and u win😅
Guarantee thete is only one A in there, and it's upside down, right at the bottom in the centre.
I feel like they have one letter in the claw machine that's way less stocked than the other. Like the A for example..
update on lucky duck
Ye, I hate having to much pp
The A doesn’t exist. Its as real as the movie Shazam with sinbad
We have to many pp ☠️
YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!
FINALLY OMG IVE MISSED YOUR VIDS
THE LEGEND IS BACK AFTER A MONTH. (I wonder what happened to him)
Amazing Content ✍🏽✍🏽
The other guy needs a a too theres another series same crap he needs a a arcade warrior
Bro copied arcade warrior
In case anyone is wondering, he won a Bose speaker from the other series since that’s what most people probably want to know
You’re back!!!!!!!!!!! We missed you ❤❤❤
Who’s the random kid? Haha that’s hilarious
I did this last year and after a month or so of on and off playing i won. However what they don’t tell you is that its a used ipad mini 2 from 2014
I been watching another you tuber or whatever ppl call yuns lol and he has been doing this claw game for awhile.. I believe there isn’t an A in the machine or maybe it’s at the very bottom but seems machine gets filled back up regularly?
What did you win with the duck ?
It will be a long trip
Part 5 tag me plz
Didn’t arcade warrior due this
0:00
Yay your back
So it’s now a race between Arcade Warrior and ClawCraziness, feel like clawcraziness is at a disadvantage as arcade warrior is on day 30 something. Be really funny if they were playing from the same machine and saw each other 🤣
Please show your pic as a lucky duck!!
Where have you been? lol
Me: oh wow a little kid-
*8 seconds later*
Me: omfg he disappeared-
it great to finally see this again so how many letters do you have in total because now makes me wonder what will happen if you got double of each letter and is your picture in the lucky duck claw machine now
Yes!! He returns!
What did you get from the duck?
HE’S BACK! 🎉
Please give me ipad❤❤
