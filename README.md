# SocialMediaProductAnalysis
Analysis of Consumer Sentiment from Social Media Data
This project leverages APIs (YouTube, Google, Reddit) and Python Libraries to delve into consumer sentiment expressed in social media data.

Project Overview
The system takes user queries, scours social media platforms, and gathers the most pertinent comments, posts, threads, and so on.
Data preprocessing techniques are employed to handle slang, emojis, and extract sentiment-laden sentences.
Transformers and BERT are harnessed for sentiment sentence labeling.
Results are presented in a visually appealing manner for effortless interpretation.
Ongoing efforts include translating phonetic Hindi to English and extracting the ground truth from articles (e.g., iPhone 15 launch).
